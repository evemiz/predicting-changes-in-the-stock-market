            "content": "The Paris Olympics have provided a boost to the eurozone economy after a sharp rise in spending as athletes and spectators descended on the French capital for the summer sporting event. Figures from a closely watched survey of businesses showed monthly French private sector output rose to its highest level in 17 months in August. Economists said the growth in activity, fuelled by the French service sector as millions of tourists flocked to Paris for the two-and-a-half week sporting event, bolstered the figures for the entire 27-country bloc. The eurozone composite purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), conducted by the Hamburg Commercial Bank and S&amp;P Global, rose to 51.2 in August from 50.2 a month earlier, where anything above 50 signals growth. However, experts warned the Olympic boost masked a disappointing performance elsewhere, amid a slowdown in activity across the eurozone led by a collapse in manufacturing output, particularly in Germany. Bert Colijn, a senior economist for the eurozone at the Dutch bank ING, said: \u201cEurozone manufacturing continues to resemble Germany\u2019s performance at the Olympics: a big disappointment.\u201d Hosting the Olympic Games can deliver economic benefits, acting as a catalyst for construction, tourism and the events industry, as well as by raising the global profile of host countries and businesses. The UK government estimated that hosting the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games generated up to \u00a341bn for the British economy by 2020. The International Olympic Committee estimated the Paris Games could produce a $12.2bn (\u00a39.3bn) economic benefit within the \u00cele-de-France region, while the 2028 Los Angeles Games could provide an $18.3bn boost in output. However, while major sporting events can benefit some parts of the economy, they can also displace activity in other areas, making it difficult to quantify the net impact. Despite the boost to the French service sector, analysts warned the underlying picture for the wider eurozone economy suggested the outlook was weak enough to warrant another interest rate cut from the European Central Bank. Cyrus de la Rubia, the chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: \u201cA closer look at the numbers reveals that the underlying fundamentals might be shakier than they appear. \u201cThe boost largely comes from a surge in services activity in France, with the business activity index jumping by almost five points, likely linked to the buzz surrounding the Olympic Games in Paris. \u201cIt\u2019s doubtful this momentum will carry over into the coming months, however. Meanwhile, the overall pace of growth in the services sector has slowed down in Germany, and the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector remains in rapid decline.\u201d Separate PMI figures for the UK showed a rise in output to the highest level in four months after a robust upturn in new order intakes, helped by an upbeat assessment of the domestic economic outlook by businesses. The reading on the UK PMI composite output index increased from 52.8 in July to 53.4 in August. Thomas Pugh, an economist at RSM UK, said the figures suggested the Bank of England would probably wait until November before cutting interest rates again, and added: \u201cThe August PMIs point to an economy that is continuing to recover after last year\u2019s recession with output and employment rising and confidence remaining high.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-09T17:41:21Z",
            "content": "Black Americans strongly support initiatives that would increase the minimum wage to $17, make affordable housing more accessible and create an equitable tax system, according to Black to the Future Action Fund, a political advocacy thinktank. On Thursday, the group released a 55-page economic agenda based on its 2023 survey of 211,219 Black people across all 50 states. The organization hopes that the report will serve as a roadmap for elected officials to address policy holes, and for advocates to generate campaigns that hold politicians accountable. \u201cWe have to start imagining what it is that we want and not be so afraid to break out of what is,\u201d said Alicia Garza, founder and former principal of Black to the Future Action Fund, at a Thursday symposium in Atlanta. The agenda suggests a range of policy shifts around worker protections, housing, healthcare, childcare, higher education and taxes, along with examples of successful models already implemented by some state governments and municipalities. \u201cEconomic insecurity experienced by Black communities cannot be resolved solely by individual actions like working more hours, getting a college degree or saving money to buy a home,\u201d the agenda\u2019s authors wrote. \u201cThese issues are systemic, and government intervention is required to eliminate these inequities and improve outcomes for our people.\u201d Along with increasing the minimum wage to $17, the authors also recommended that elected officials pass labor protections for domestic workers, many of whom are Black women. The expansion of paid family and medical leave laws would help workers care for their household. And on the topic of affordable housing, the thinktank recommended laws that ensure rent payments are incorporated into credit scores so that renters have greater access to obtaining home mortgages. Another suggestion for affordable housing included the development of shared equity programs, which use public or private investments to build or buy homes that are then sold at a reduced rate to low-to-moderate income homebuyers. There are currently 250,000 shared equity models mainly in New York City, according to the agenda. Christopher Towler, a political science associate professor at Sacramento State University and director of the Black Voter Project, called the programs \u201ca really good model to try and get people into the housing market for there to be more first-time homebuyers\u201d. The origins of the US\u2019s persistent racial wealth can be traced back to the transatlantic slave trade, when enslaved Black people were barred from accessing capital generated by their forced labor. During the Reconstruction period after the civil war, then president Andrew Johnson rescinded the 40 acres (16 hectares) of land promised to formerly enslaved Black people. When Black communities did secure economic freedom, they were sometimes violently attacked by angry white mobs, including during the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, where an estimated 300 people were killed. Additionally, banks often denied home loans to Black Americans from the early 20th century until the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that outlawed housing discrimination. \u201cThe failures of Reconstruction have yet to be made up,\u201d said Towler. \u201cAnd a large part of that is the continued residential segregation and how Black Americans have been locked out, not only of the housing market, but of the resources, the wealth, the opportunity that comes along with where you live and your access to community.\u201d The legacy of systemic inequality has a continued impact on Black workers today, who earn less than US workers overall, according to 2022 Bureau of Labor Statistics data cited by Pew Research Center. The median weekly earnings of Black full-time wage and salary workers is $878, compared to $1,059 for all US workers, according to Pew. During Thursday\u2019s symposium, the actor and activist Kendrick Sampson, the singer and songwriter Trae Crockett, and the digital storyteller Conscious Lee spoke with Garza about the need for Black communities to brainstorm needed solutions and to band together to effect political change. \u201cWhen it comes to healthcare,\u201d said Lee, \u201ca lot of us \u2026 have internalized the Black inferiority when it comes to that industry. So for me, it\u2019s really reimagining what it looks like for my grandma to get affordable insulin.\u201d Black census respondents listed a lack of affordable healthcare as their fourth most immediate economic concern. Expanding Medicaid to the 10 states that have not done so under the Affordable Care Act could help keep rural hospitals open. \u201cThe communities most affected when these rural hospitals close often have significant Black populations,\u201d the report stated, \u201cand closure means rural residents must drive 25 or more miles to access medical care.\u201d While Towler lauded the agenda as the first one he\u2019s seen that addresses the concerns of Black communities nationwide, he believes that it will be a \u201ctough sell\u201d to mobilize Black voters. \u201cAny sort of policy promises right now are going to be looked at with some hesitations, simply because the Biden administration\u2019s policy agenda, although very numerous in its accomplishments, is still in some ways misunderstood,\u201d said Towler. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of knowledge with the common voter about how the policies that Biden passed have actually affected their individual lives.\u201d According to his research, Towler said that people are encouraged to be civically engaged when they\u2019re taught how political institutions uphold the status quo to resist change: \u201cIf you even want there to be a possibility of reparations, we have to continue to vote, continue to be active and continue to put in place policy makers and legislators that are working towards that.\u201d At the end of the symposium, organizers asked participants to share the agenda with their network and elected officials. In the eyes of the Black to the Future Action Fund, the electorate is capable of shifting policy through mass mobilization. \u201cWe are the power,\u201d Sampson said toward the end of the symposium. \u201cIf we all are in alignment and we go in the same direction, now we are more powerful.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-28T15:03:25Z",
            "content": "Before a whistlestop European tour to Berlin and Paris, Keir Starmer promised to mend \u201cthe broken relationships left behind by the previous government\u201d and drive forward UK economic growth. Changing the tone with European leaders is the easy bit. Changing the substance \u2013 especially finding new arrangements to boost growth \u2013 is a much taller order. Starmer, who reiterated in Berlin on Wednesday that growth was \u201cthe number one mission of my government\u201d, is not the first prime minister to find economic ambitions crimped by self-imposed red lines on Europe. Labour has ruled out rejoining the EU\u2019s single market and customs union, the steps that would have the biggest impact in improving trade with the EU. Instead, the Labour manifesto promised to tear down \u201cunnecessary barriers to trade\u201d by negotiating a veterinary agreement with the EU, improving access for touring artists to the continent and striking mutual recognition agreements for professionals. Such policies amount to little more than \u201ctinkering around the edges of the relationship\u201d and would do little to \u201caddress the continuing economic impacts of Brexit\u201d, concluded a recent report from the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe (UKice). Meanwhile, the Office for Budget Responsibility, backed by independent economists, has said its forecast for a 15% reduction in trade as a result of Brexit was \u201cbroadly on track\u201d. Academics at UKice expect that the veterinary agreement could boost UK agri-food exports by 22.5%, a lifeline for some small businesses but not decisive for the overall economy. Labour hopes it can deepen the economic relationship without joining the EU\u2019s structures. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, for instance, has suggested a \u201cbespoke\u201d arrangement for the chemicals industry to avoid \u00a32bn of extra costs mostly associated with duplicating EU requirements. Talk of bespoke deals raises the ghosts that haunted the Brexit negotiations, namely the UK taking the benefits of the single market free from the EU\u2019s common rules, enforcement or budget payments. \u201cPeople will soon rediscover there is a reason why there were red lines,\u201d a senior EU official told the Guardian. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is to have the single market cut in pieces. The UK \u2013 they are very good negotiators and they always want to cherrypick.\u201d That said, officials are not expecting the enormous mismatch of expectations that bedevilled the early years of Brexit negotiations under Theresa May. Starmer, a regular visitor to Brussels when he was Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow Brexit secretary, is well known in the EU capital. He and his team \u201care well advised\u201d, the senior official said. \u201cThey know what is feasible, what is not feasible.\u201d One EU diplomat from a large member state expressed concern that the UK government was not being straightforward with British voters about EU demands. \u201cThey have to be honest with their public. We are not a shelf you can pick things off,\u201d they said. The EU has been disappointed by Labour\u2019s dismissive response to a proposed youth mobility scheme that would allow people aged 18-30 to work, live, study or travel for up to four years. Nils Schmid, the foreign affairs spokesperson for Olaf Scholz\u2019s SPD party in the Bundestag, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that a youth mobility scheme was \u201ca major feature of our wishlist\u201d, but \u201cnot about immigration in a general sense\u201d. Yet when answering a parliamentary question about the scheme in July, Starmer framed it in general terms: \u201cWe are not returning to freedom of movement.\u201d In Berlin, however, he struck a more nuanced approach that seemed to leave the door open to some kind of youth mobility programme. The earlier outright rejection dismayed the EU, especially its repeated conflation of a time-limited youth mobility scheme with free movement of people, a lifelong right for EU citizens. The EU diplomat expressed disappointment over Labour \u201cdismissing it right out of hand because it looks like free movement [when] it is not free movement at all\u201d. The person added: \u201cI am personally surprised they think it\u2019s toxic when [the UK has] the same arrangement with others,\u201d referring to a UK-Australia agreement. Starmer\u2019s government will face other EU demands. France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and other coastal states want to ensure post-Brexit fishing rights are extended beyond June 2026 when current arrangements lapse. Meanwhile, the European Commission insists that the UK must fully implement existing agreements before negotiating new ones, amid concern over the rights of the estimated 3.5 million EU citizens living in the UK. Late last month the commission announced it was moving forward with a legal case begun in 2020 that alleges that the UK government has failed to protect EU citizens in the UK. \u201cWe have two big agreements with the UK and we want them to be implemented,\u201d said a second EU diplomat, referring to the Brexit withdrawal agreement and subsequent trade and cooperation agreement. With Starmer expected to meet the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, soon and a UK-EU summit pencilled in for spring 2025, the government has more to do to repair the broken relationships of the past."

            "content": "Kicking off with a word from Vivienne Westwood, the Observer\u2019s 1985 Youth Style Special made a statement. The queen of punk was in typically combative mood, deploring the waning energy of the street. British style, she claimed, had started promoting \u2018eccentricity for its own sake. We need to grow up and look around.\u2019 Youth culture was in an identity crisis, \u2018split into 100m fragments\u2019 according to Peter York, and displaying \u2018an extravagant and aggressive diversity\u2019. Marketing was no longer directed at the 16-24 age group but their older siblings; moneyed 25- to 35-year-olds were the target of new chains, such as Next and Principles. \u2018What has changed is the assumption that youth is something special, the only fount of spending money and therefore wisdom.\u2019 Critical hype rarely translated into commercial support in an industry unwilling to risk supporting homegrown early-career designers. Rob Leach and Tracy Wingrove\u2019s first collections were approvingly singled out by Harper\u2019s and Vogue, they explained, but the pair were soon left with \u2018an empty order book, financial embarrassment and disillusionment\u2019. They hoped to cut out the middleman and buy a shop. The youth themselves were drawing inspiration from a new breed of magazines, particularly \u2018style leader\u2019 The Face. Launched with editor Nick Logan\u2019s building society savings, it was glossy and \u2018self-indulgent\u2019, he explained, a magazine he himself would enjoy, but influential far beyond its 70,000 subscribers with its \u2018ideas plundered throughout the trade\u2019. The Smash Hits recipe for success was song lyrics, full-colour pics and avoiding \u2018tortured self-consciousness\u2019 thanks to new writers (including one described as having \u2018a haircut kept together by raw egg and orange juice\u2019). Just Seventeen followed a formula of \u2018fashion, fiction, popstars and straightforward advice\u2019 and avoided slimming stories: \u2018There\u2019s quite enough misery around without us contributing to it,\u2019 editor Dave Hepworth commented. For light relief, comedian Ade Edmondson dressed up as Britain\u2019s fashion tribes: the Hooray Henry, the Casual, the Gender Bender, the Headbanger, the Punk and the Normal. \u2018Am I silly?\u2019 he asked. Surely the easiest 1985 style question to answer."

            "date": "2024-08-06T11:15:49Z",
            "content": "Young protesters in Kenya successfully demanded the withdrawal of a bill that would have raised taxes on everything from bread to vegetable oil and sanitary towels. Inspired by their neighbours, Ugandans marched against corruption. Nigerians rallied against \u201cbad governance\u201d and the soaring cost of living. Since the Covid pandemic, people have also taken to the streets in several other African countries including Ghana, Angola, Malawi and Senegal. While each protest has had unique drivers, they have some things in common \u2013 booming young populations struggling with high inflation, a lack of good jobs and a political class that they don\u2019t trust. \u201cHere in Kenya, if you look at these protests, actually, they were led by educated people. But most of them [were] jobless,\u201d said Anthony Kamande, an inequality researcher at Oxfam, based in Nairobi. Africa is a young continent \u2013 70% of the population is under the age of 30, according to the UN. Its population is expected to almost double in 30 years, to 2.2 billion. Gen Z and millennial Africans are better educated than the generations before them. Of 22 countries that provided data to Unesco for 2011 to 2021, the proportion of students going on to higher education fell in only three. However, more than 10 million people are entering the workforce each year in sub-Saharan Africa, vying for just 3m jobs, according to the World Bank. Many of those who don\u2019t get formal work hustle in the badly paid, risky informal sector. Unemployment was ranked as the most important problem by 18- to 35-year-olds surveyed by the pan-African survey organisation Afrobarometer. On top of this, the economic shocks of the past few years \u2013 Covid, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sending food, fuel and fertiliser prices soaring, and the US central bank\u2019s interest rate hikes pushing up borrowing costs globally \u2013 have triggered cost of living crises in many countries. Inflation was still double-digits in about a third of sub-Saharan African countries earlier this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. In Nigeria, it is running above 34% after the removal of a costly fuel subsidy and a botched series of currency devaluations. These policy changes, which started when Bola Tinubu took office as president in May 2023, didn\u2019t cause protests immediately. \u201cPrior to the presidential election in 2023, each of the three candidates said FX [foreign exchange] liberalisation needs to happen and the fuel subsidy is unaffordable and needs to go,\u201d said Razia Khan, Middle East and Africa chief economist at Standard Chartered bank. \u201cThere was just an acceptance on the part of Nigerians.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a year after the initial fuel subsidy removal that we\u2019re seeing protests and that\u2019s really driven by the fact that the cost of living crisis has not eased meaningfully and that inflation continues to be at runaway levels,\u201d she added. In contrast, in Kenya, tax rises were never broadly accepted. Protesters \u201cfeel that those in government, and parliamentarians in some cases, should also bear the pain by cutting spending\u201d, said Yvonne Mhango, Africa economist at Bloomberg, pointing to the now-axed offices of Kenya\u2019s first and second ladies. Kamande, the Oxfam researcher, also blamed rising inequality and a debt crisis that has led to cash-strapped governments trying to raise taxes on ordinary people. \u201cWe need debt cancellation. It\u2019s long overdue \u2013 it should have happened yesterday,\u201d he said. Heavy debt burdens have swallowed up public spending. Kenya is spending a third of government revenues servicing its debt. In Ghana, half of government income went on debt servicing in 2022, before it defaulted at the end of that year. Ethiopia is also restructuring its debt, while trying to avoid the soaring inflation that Nigeria has experienced since devaluing its currency. The east African country let its birr currency weaken 30% against the US dollar last week. Later that day, the IMF signed off on a $3.4bn (\u00a32,68bn), four-year loan. Ethiopia is also expected to get $16.6bn from the World Bank over the next three years. While an artificially strong exchange rate is not necessarily sustainable, the fallout from devaluations can be painful, said Daouda Sembene, the chief executive of the Dakar-based consultancy Africatalyst. \u201cAttention also needs to be put \u2026 to make sure that those who are likely to suffer from it are protected,\u201d said Sembene, a former IMF executive director. Many of the pressures fuelling recent protests were not going away, said Charlie Robertson, head of macro-strategy at FIM Partners, which manages investments in emerging market countries: \u201cPolitical protest is all that educated youth have.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-06T05:54:31Z",
            "content": "Fears of a US recession have gripped global markets, triggering a share market rout that prompted investors across Asia, Europe and North America to all unwind their positions \u2013 at the same time. The severe plunge has raised questions over whether investors are facing a historic share market crash \u2013 similar to the global financial crisis or 1987\u2019s Black Monday \u2013 or if it\u2019s simply an overdue pull-back after a stellar period of strong returns. What caused the market meltdown? The volatile conditions erupted after the US Federal Reserve hinted after its 31 July meeting that interest rates would soon be cut, in what was initially seen as a stimulus for shares. But the gains quickly evaporated as investors reinterpreted the impending rate cuts as a sign the world\u2019s biggest economy was faltering. Several pieces of economic data, including manufacturing, durable goods and \u2013 crucially \u2013 jobs and payroll data, raised questions over the health of the US economy, with the well-regarded \u201cSahm Rule\u201d signalling a recession. This indicator, which is triggered when there is a rapid rise in the unemployment rate, has correctly identified every recession since the second world war. AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said \u201crecession fears are now back with a vengeance, particularly in the US\u201d. Nick Healy, a Sydney-based portfolio manager at Wilson Asset Management, said that the US data proved to be softer than expectations, triggering a strong market reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to classify it as an unwinding of positioning but my view is that it\u2019s hard to extrapolate too strongly into the future from one month of economic data,\u201d said Healy. After a weekend break to digest the news, a rout took hold in Asian markets on Monday and swept through European and American markets later in the day. Wall Street\u2019s gauge of fear, the CBOE Volatility Index, shot up above 65; levels not recorded since the pandemic, and reminiscent of the GFC, before settling. The S&amp;P 500 lost 3% on Monday, while the tech-focused Nasdaq shed 3.43%. While both figures were remarkable, they were more modest than what the futures market initially pointed to, providing some relief to traders and raising hopes the sell off wouldn\u2019t turn into a full blown meltdown. Even after the losses, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index is still up more than 9% since January, as is the Nasdaq. What was hit hardest? Shares, stock markets and indices that had risen the most tended to fall the furthest. Chip maker Nvidia, which has led a period of robust returns for the tech sector, was down by as much as 15% at one point on Monday, before halving its losses, while bitcoin also fell sharply. Australia\u2019s share market suffered its worst day since the onset of the pandemic, erasing more than $100bn in value from local stocks in a single trading session. But it was Japan\u2019s Nikkei which came under the most extreme pressure, plunging by 12% on Monday before rebounding strongly early on Tuesday. Investors have been concerned about the state of the Japanese economy and the recent effects of a strengthening yen, which has unravelled the so-called \u201ccarry trade\u201d, in which investors borrow cheaply in yen and buy higher-yielding assets including the US dollar. Analysts had warned that the yen carry trade was unwinding, triggering margin calls and forced selling. Online trading firm IG said that it suspected the frenzied market action in Japan was the \u201cfinal act of cleansing of long positions in the Japan trade\u201d, referring to investors who were caught up in the yen-carry trade. Some safe haven assets, such as bonds, proved to be among the few hiding spots from the turmoil, with the sharp moves challenging all the sure bets of recent months. That upbeat sentiment had been underpinned by optimism about AI technologies and the wider tech sector, along with expectations inflation would cool, job markets remain robust and economies emerge from the inflationary period intact. What happens next? While it\u2019s too early to tell whether the selling pressure will abate, at the very least the sharp falls are a warning shot. The global recession concerns of recent years have been tied to a fear that cost-of-living pressures will eventually depress spending to such an extent that economies will shift into reverse. One \u201ccanary in the coalmine\u201d investors look to is American online furniture and home goods company Wayfair, which warned on Thursday that customers were very cautious after recording a near 25% fall from peak spending levels recorded three years ago \u201cThis mirrors the magnitude of the peak-to-trough correction the home furnishing space experienced during the great financial crisis,\u201d Wayfair chief executive Niraj Shah said on the earnings call. While those discretionary spending figures support a case for an ensuing bear market, investors also have an eye on the upcoming US election and associated spending initiatives, which could act as another stimulus for shares. \u201cThere is a situation where both candidates and both parties are very happy to spend money which should keep fiscal dollars going into the economy,\u201d said Healy."

            "date": "2024-08-05T16:45:18Z",
            "content": "Choose the culprit behind the sudden sell-off in stock markets but a common theme in all top contenders is complacency. In the first case, it is the US Federal Reserve that stands accused, in the eyes of the market, of being asleep to the risk of a recession in the US. Friday\u2019s weak jobs numbers intensified the worry that policymakers have waited too long to cut interest rates. Even if a US recession in the next year remains unlikely in the eyes of most economists (a 25% possibility, says Goldman Sachs, upping its forecast from 15%), it\u2019s the difference from previous expectations that moves markets. At the start of 2024, virtually nobody was talking about a US recession; now it is a plausible outcome to be priced into models. The second example of complacency is the super, soaraway performance of the US technology sector. From early 2023 until mid-2024, the likes of Nvidia went upwards in a straight line, more or less. Sceptics who said that it all felt a little bubbly, and pointed to parallels with the late 1990s bubble in dotcom stocks, were ignored in the stampede. But we\u2019re now at a point where boring questions are being asked about when the vast sums of capital being invested in the AI revolution will earn a meaningful return. Given how far valuations have risen (even after the post-June mini-correction), it is impossible to say what a rethink might mean for short-term tech valuations. Momentum can work in both directions. Then there is the special contribution to complacency from Japan, where the Nikkei 225 index fell a spectacular 12% on Monday. A modest rise in interest rates in Japan last week (from an extremely low level) has upset a favourite market game of borrowing in yen to buy high-yielding assets elsewhere. The yen has risen by 10% against the dollar in less than a month, which is a huge shift. The scale of Japan-related moves on Monday carried the whiff of leveraged bets getting scorched on a grand scale. From that unlovely mix of market-moving factors, the US outlook is by far the most important. The Japanese carry trade has burned speculators many times in the past without causing wider damage. As for the AI revolution, investors in Nvidia are still sitting on a 100% capital gain this year, so should not be blind to the risk that it may be a case of too much, too soon. But nothing destroys stock market returns in all corners of the market quite like a recession. The good news, of a sort, is that a one in four chance of a US downturn, if the forecast is roughly correct, still represents decent odds of a gentle-ish landing. But the less clear part \u2013 and the element that will guarantee a twitchy summer as every piece of economic data is suddenly given extra importance \u2013 is waiting for the US Fed to act to cut rates, as bond markets are now in effect demanding. An emergency cut in interest rates feels highly unlikely, as things currently stand. Last week\u2019s job report was bad, but Monday\u2019s US services sector report pointed in the opposite direction by showing a strengthening in business activity and new orders. Thus plan A for the Fed will surely be to wait until its next scheduled meeting in mid-September. Anything else would be an admission of a mistake. But September suddenly feels a long way off. The S&amp;P 500 index, despite it all, is still up about 10% this year, which leaves plenty of room for further wild days if investors decide the Fed has made a terrible error and the recession odds are worsening. August could be a long month."

            "content": "Japanese stocks soared more than 10% on Tuesday, a day after experiencing their biggest fall in 37 years, setting markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street. Other markets in Asia also appeared to settle somewhat after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo closed up 10.3% \u2013 up 3,217 to 34,675, a record daily points rise \u2013 as investors bought into bargains after the 12.4% rout the day before. South Korea\u2019s Kospi index was up 3%, while Australia\u2019s ASX200 added 0.4% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was steady in morning trading. Markets on Monday started with a plunge reminiscent of 1987\u2019s Black Monday crash that swept around the world and pummelled Wall Street with more steep losses, as fears worsened about a slowing US economy. Wall Street suffered its worst day in almost two years, while European markets also fell, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 suffering its steepest one-day decline in more than a year. The drops on Monday were the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to the global sell-off, which began on Friday, after a US report showed employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the US economy to come in weaker than expected, raising fears the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation. Professional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan\u2019s move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world. Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone, said after \u201cthe breathtaking and historic moves seen across Asian markets\u201d on Monday \u201cwe look for a solid counter rally on open today.\u201d Federal Reserve officials did their best to reassure markets with Fed San Francisco president Mary Daly saying it was \u201cextremely important\u201d to prevent the labour market tipping into a downturn. Daly added that her mind was open to cutting interest rates as necessary and policy needed to be proactive. The comments underpinned market expectations that the Fed would cut by 50 basis points at its September meeting, with futures implying an 87% chance of such an outsized move.

            "date": "2024-08-01T20:31:53Z",
            "content": "US investors triggered a major sell-off on Wall Street on Thursday set off by fears that the job market is cooling, manufacturing is slowing and the Federal Reserve has left cutting interests too late to head off a recession. The Dow Jones fell nearly 500 points (1.2%), while the S&amp;P 500 was also down 1.3%. A series of disappointing results from tech companies have led to sell-offs in big tech. After a rally on Wednesday following Meta\u2019s second-quarter earnings results, which were better than expected, the tech-heavy Nasdaq\u2019s index was down 2.3%. The bad news continued after markets closed with Intel announcing 15,000 layoffs and Amazon releasing disappointing results. Two economic data points released on Thursday appeared to spook investors. One measurement of manufacturing activity by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) hit an eight-month low in July, while the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits hit an 11-month high last week, according to data released on Thursday. \u201cThe ISM is really what started the ball rolling today and then selling causes more selling,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls &amp; Snyder in New York. \u201cWe\u2019re still in earnings season and there will be positive surprises that will probably drive the market higher and there may be negative surprises as well \u2026 but if you get something negative like ISM, it causes profit-taking.\u201d Despite Thursday\u2019s stock sell-off, the stock market has still had a relatively strong year, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq up 14.3% and 16% this year, respectively. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq registered their biggest daily percentage gains since February in the prior session, boosted by a rally in chip shares after the Fed kept rates steady, as expected. Thursday\u2019s data came a day after the Federal Reserve announced it would keep rates at a two-decade high until September. Investors expected rates would be held steady, and many expect the first cut to come next month. But while the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, confirmed that the central bank would be willing to drop rates soon, any cut would only come if inflation over the summer proves to be somewhat stable. Inflation in June was 3%, one of the lowest months since prices started rising in 2021. \u201cIf inflation were to prove stickier, and we were seeing higher rates of inflation and disappointing readings, we would weigh that along with other things,\u201d Powell said on Wednesday, though he added that the Fed was also focused on the labor market, the other half of the Fed\u2019s \u201cdual-mandate\u201d. Unemployment in June hit 4.1% \u2013 the highest its been since 2021. The Fed\u2019s next meeting is 20 September. Reuters contributed reporting"

            "date": "2024-08-11T10:12:40Z",
            "content": "Back in the 1930s, the French government constructed what it thought was an impregnable defence system to prevent a repeat of the German invasion at the start of the first world war. The Maginot Line might have looked impressive but proved to be a white elephant because when the attack came in 1940 it was in a different place altogether. In the past week the financial markets have displayed something of a Maginot Line mentality. They are right to think there is a threat lurking out there but they are wrong to think the biggest danger is a recession in the US. The real threat comes from elsewhere. To be sure, the US economy is slowing down, but it is not remotely close to recession. Unemployment is rising but from historically low levels. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, has left it a bit late to cut interest rates but it can make up for lost time over the coming months. The US economy has staying power and \u2013 as in the past \u2013 is likely to confound the pessimists. After an extreme bout of the jitters, by the end of last week Wall Street seemed to have come round to the idea that the US is on course for a soft landing. That looks by far the most plausible outcome. There are two other sources of potential trouble: the Middle East and China. Far too little attention is being paid to the risks that the war in Gaza escalates into a full-scale conflict between Israel and Iran. In the past, this kind of ratcheting up of tension would have led to a sharp increase in the cost of crude, but it hasn\u2019t happened. A Middle East-induced oil shock has been the dog that hasn\u2019t barked. For now. One reason rising tension in the Middle East has not been reflected in commodity markets is that China\u2019s growth prospects have taken a turn for the worse. The belief in the financial markets is that policymakers in Beijing will take action to stimulate the economy and that the slowdown will be temporary. Again, this is a questionable assumption. China\u2019s problems are structural and have big implications for the rest of the world. For decades it has relied on a growth model based on building up industrial capacity through massive state investment and cheap credit. The concentration on manufacturing has resulted in relatively weak levels of consumer spending coupled with a rapidly deflating property bubble. A recalibration of this model \u2013 shifting the balance away from investment and exports towards consumption \u2013 is long overdue. Social safety nets offer far less protection than they do in the west, and it has proved impossible for the domestic economy to absorb all the goods produced by China\u2019s factories. The excess capacity has been sold as exports, leading to huge trade surpluses. From time to time, China\u2019s leaders flirt with the idea of changing tack but are wedded to the strategy that has resulted in the country becoming the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. In the 1990s, it was this model of export-led growth that helped push down inflation in the west \u2013 and it is doing so again. Goods prices in the UK in June were 1.4% lower than a year earlier \u2013 partly the result of China flooding the market with cut-priced goods. Writing in Foreign Affairs magazine, Zongyuan Zoe Liu, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, notes that China is producing twice as many solar panels as the rest of the world can put to use, while almost a third of car manufacturers are unprofitable. \u201cChina is producing far more output than it, or foreign markets, can sustainably absorb. As a result, the Chinese economy runs the risk of getting caught in a doom loop of falling prices, insolvency, factory closure, and, ultimately, job losses,\u201d she says. The mismatch between supply and demand has meant Chinese companies have had to cut their prices, resulting in falling profits, and even deeper discounting as they struggle to pay off their debts and remain afloat. There are already signs of stress. Growth looks as if it will undershoot this year\u2019s 5% target set by officials in Beijing. Export figures released last week failed to meet market expectations. A measure of the money supply, which has a track record as a lead indicator of future growth, is flashing red. Two things differentiate the China now from the China of the 1990s. First, the problems of overcapacity and overproduction have intensified. Second, western governments are no longer prepared to sit back and allow their own industries to be wiped out. They have whacked tariffs on Chinese goods and \u2013 in the case of the US \u2013 offered generous subsidies to domestic producers. There are a number of ways this could play out. China might bow to western pressure, voluntarily limit its exports, and recast its whole economic model. This seems highly improbable. Far more likely is that tensions between the west and China intensify rather than ease. Beijing insists it is not guilty of dumping its excess production on global markets, while Washington and Brussels insist it is. China is already trying to divert exports through third countries in order to avoid western tariffs but has so far resisted the temptation to introduce tit-for-tat measures of its own. A short-term risk is that the west\u2019s protectionist actions lead to higher prices, higher inflation and higher interest rates. A longer-term risk is of the west adding to the global glut goods by ramping up its own production. In that event, the rate of profit would fall and global capitalism would face of a crisis of its own making \u2013 just as Karl Marx predicted."

            "date": "2024-08-16T03:54:18Z",
            "content": "The Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock, has downplayed the role of government spending in keeping inflation elevated, citing consumer spending and China\u2019s slowdown as bigger influences on Australia\u2019s economic trajectory. \u201cI want to be clear that public demand is not the main game,\u201d Bullock told the House of Representatives economics committee on Friday. Instead, she pointed to consumption, residential construction and trade as \u201cthe big swing things that are going to impact us over the next year or so\u201d. Bullock\u2019s comments come 10 days after the RBA left the cash rate unchanged for a sixth board meeting in a row, with Bullock warning that an interest rate cut was unlikely this year. A week ago, she also said the bank wouldn\u2019t hesitate to lift the rate if annual inflation wasn\u2019t on track to reach its 2%-3% range. The RBA has raised its forecasts for the pace of growth in spending by federal, state and local governments to an annual clip of 4.3% by December and 4.1% by next June. That compared with its projections three months earlier of spending growth rates of 1.5% and 2.1%, respectively, prompting some to speculate the central bank\u2019s inflation efforts were being undermined by public sector profligacy. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Three months earlier the bank had projected spending growth rates of 1.5% and 2.1%, respectively, prompting some to speculate its efforts to rein in inflation were being undermined by public sector profligacy. Still, inflation remained \u201ctoo high\u201d and its reduction from an annual 7.8% peak at the end of 2022 \u201chas been slow\u201d, Bullock said. \u201cBased on what the board knows at present, it does not expect that it will be in a position to cut rates in the near term.\u201d Among the threats posed to the country\u2019s economic fortunes, China\u2019s weak growth was \u201ca risk that\u2019s very pertinent for us\u201d, Bullock said. China was easily Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner but also critical for the prices of commodity exports, particularly iron ore. Massive over-building \u2013 with enough completed apartments to meet years of demand in many cities \u2013 has dented consumer sentiment but also curbed output from steel mills and other sectors of the economy. \u201cThat is something that we\u2019re watching quite closely because developments in China can have quite a big impact on the way our trade develops, and therefore on our growth,\u201d she said. RBA officials also downplayed a rise in insolvencies as firms struggled with higher interest rates. The recent increase was against \u201cabsolutely historically low levels\u201d during the pandemic, Bullock said. \u201cI you look at the trend of insolvencies over time, we\u2019re not even back to where we were trend-wise, pre pandemic.\u201d The assistant governor, Brad Jones, said the construction sector had been \u201cfront and centre\u201d to the rise in firms going bust, but they were typically very small enterprises with \u201clow single-digit number of employees\u201d. In the past six months there had been \u201csome levelling out in the stress in the construction sector\u201d, Jones said, but noted pressure was building in the arts, hospitality and some segments of the retail space."

            "date": "2024-08-14T14:55:20Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s annual inflation rate rose to 2.2% last month \u2013 its first increase since December last year \u2013 and is expected to remain above its 2% target for the rest of the year. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the government\u2019s preferred measure of the cost of living climbed again as domestic energy bills fell by less last month than in July 2023. Gabriella Dickens, G7 economist at Axa Investment Managers, said July\u2019s rise was not a one-off. \u201cThe headline rate will rise again over the next few months, as the sharp declines in energy prices in 2023 are not repeated. We expect inflation to end the year marginally in excess of 2.5%,\u201d she said. The Bank said earlier this month that it expected the consumer prices index measure of inflation would continue rising and peak at about 2.75% before falling back again. Despite the prospect of inflation continuing to rise, July\u2019s increase was slightly smaller than the increase to 2.3% anticipated by the financial markets, and prompted speculation of possible back-to-back interest rate cuts when Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee meets next month. Borrowing costs were cut from 5.25% to 5% earlier this month. Prices fell by 0.2% in July \u2013 helped by cheaper hotel stays \u2013 but this was smaller than the 0.4% decrease in prices in July 2023, when energy bills dropped sharply, meaning that the headline rate of inflation increased. The energy price cap, set by the industry regulator, Ofgem, fell by 8.6% in July 2023 but by 7.2% in the same month this year. The ONS\u2019s chief economist, Grant Fitzner, said: \u201cInflation ticked up a little in July as, although domestic energy costs fell, they fell by less than a year ago. This was partially offset by hotel costs, which fell in July after strong growth in June.\u201d Core inflation \u2013 which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco \u2013 rose by 3.3% in the year to July, down from 3.5% in June. Inflation in the services sector, which is closely watched by the Bank\u2019s interest rate setters, fell from 5.7% to 5.2% last month. The fall in services sector inflation was largely because of falling hotel prices, which dropped by 6.4% in July compared with an 8.2% rise the previous year. The ONS said it doubted whether the drop in the cost of a hotel room could be attributed to the ending of price hikes caused by Taylor Swift concerts in June, which some analysts had suggested. Martin Sartorius, a principal economist at the employers\u2019 lobbying group the CBI, said: \u201cInflation undershooting the Bank of England\u2019s expectations will be seen as a positive sign that price pressures are continuing to normalise for households and businesses. \u201cToday\u2019s data will give the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee some measure of confidence that domestic price pressures are less likely to derail a sustainable return to the 2% target.\u201d Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cThe new government is under no illusion as to the scale of the challenge we have inherited, with many families still struggling with the cost of living. That is why we are taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations of our economy so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of the country better off.\u201d Jeremy Hunt, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThe chancellor must not use this data as an excuse to break her promises and hike up taxes \u2013 tax rises she had planned all along.\u201d The money markets now indicate that there is a 40% chance that the Bank Rate will be cut to 4.75% next month. Before Wednesday\u2019s data, a September rate cut was only a 36% probability, according to City pricing. The ONS figures coincide with the publication of a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank showing that poorer UK households faced significantly higher food price inflation than richer households during the height of the cost of living crisis between 2021 and 2023. The ONS said food and non-alcoholic beverage prices had risen by 1.5% in the year to July 2024, the same rate as the year to June. The June figure was the joint lowest annual rate since October 2021, when it was 1.3%, but for the first time since March 2023 the annual rate did not come down, the ONS said. Although the pace of food-price inflation has moderated, the cost of groceries has increased by 32.6% since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Gas prices are up by 68% and electricity prices by 45%. July\u2019s retail prices index inflation figure, which was 3.6% last month, was historically used to set the following year\u2019s annual rail fare rise until 2023. The Department for Transport has not revealed whether this will now be used to determine changes in the cost of train travel. A spokesperson said: \u201cNo decisions have been made on next year\u2019s rail fares but our aim is that prices are as affordable as possible for passengers.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-30T12:14:02Z",
            "content": "Eurozone inflation fell this month to its lowest since June 2021, adding to the case for the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut interest rates in September. Inflation in the single currency bloc dropped to 2.2% in August, down from 2.6% in July, and barely above the ECB\u2019s 2% target. The ECB, led by Christine Lagarde, is weighing up whether to cut interest rates at its next meeting on 12 September. In June it cut its main interest rate from 4% to 3.75%, the first downwards move since 2019. Central bankers around the world are trying to engineer \u201csoft landings\u201d \u2013 bringing inflation below target while avoiding recession. The Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, last week said \u201cthe time has come\u201d for lower interest rates in the US, although the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, has warned he is hesitant to cut rates too quickly. The expected round of interest rate cuts comes as the bout of price increases during the chaos of the Covid pandemic has faded. Supply chains were disrupted by pandemic lockdowns, leading to steep price rises, before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine caused global energy prices to soar. In August it was falling energy inflation that had the biggest effect on dragging Europe\u2019s harmonised index of consumer prices down, according to Eurostat, the EU\u2019s data agency. Core inflation, which strips out the more volatile components including energy prices, dropped slightly from 2.9 to 2.8%, but services inflation ticked up from 4% to 4.2% as hosting the Olympic Games in Paris pushed up French services prices. Bert Colijn, a senior economist for the eurozone at Dutch investment bank ING, said he did not expect core inflation to drop below 2.5% for the rest of the year. \u201cThe ECB has arrived on a long home straight when it comes to bringing inflation back to target,\u201d Colijn said. He added that the modest decline in inflationary pressures and expectations for slowing inflation next year should be enough to persuade the ECB to cut rates in September. However, he also said: \u201cThis remains a slow and gradual process of releasing the brakes on the economy as the ECB continues to be concerned about upside risks to the inflation outlook.\u201d Eurozone unemployment also edged down unexpectedly from 6.5% to 6.4%. Central bankers tend to be wary of cutting interest rates when unemployment is falling because it can be a sign of shortages of workers that could lead to inflationary pressures building. Transactions on financial markets on Friday implied that a cut to the ECB\u2019s main interest rate of 0.25 percentage points is a near certainty, with two more expected before the end of the year. Sam Miley, the forecasting lead at the Centre for Business and Economics Research, warned that \u201cthe higher rate of core inflation and continually tight labour market will present risk factors to implementing looser monetary policy\u201d."

            "content": "Back in 2019, $100 worth of groceries may have lasted a week for a household of two. Today, that same $100 will probably only buy enough groceries to stretch for a couple of days. In the last four years, food prices have increased a whopping 22%, and consumers are feeling the pinch. Even though inflation has recently fallen below 3% for the first time since 2021, food prices remain stubbornly high, and are still predicted to increase. Some food companies such as General Mills are continuing to raise prices of their products 4% this year, with profits jumping to $670.1m. Kellogg\u2019s raised the price of cereal by 12%. It\u2019s an issue that will take center stage in the upcoming presidential election: last week the Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, called for a ban on price-gouging. Meanwhile, hunger is growing in the US: according to the US Department of Agriculture, 44.2 million people in the US lived in food-insecure households in 2022, up from 33.8 million in 2021. Earlier this summer the Guardian asked readers across the US how they were experiencing grocery-store inflation \u2013 which foods give them the biggest sticker shock and how this has changed their shopping habits. Readers reported soaring prices for nearly all types of food \u2013 fresh fruits and vegetables, bread, cereal, milk, eggs, cheese, seafood, meat, particularly beef, packaged snacks, soft drinks and even pet food. Here, some of them share their strategies for coping with the ever-rising cost of food, from couponing, to cutting out meat to growing their own vegetables. \u2018I am rediscovering peanut butter sandwiches\u2019 I am less likely to pick up something spontaneously, and now I shop the reduced rack at the grocery store. I am rediscovering peanut butter sandwiches and do not buy cakes or cookies \u2013 it\u2019s cheaper and more satisfying to make them from scratch. I no longer buy red meat; funnily, we haven\u2019t missed it much. Before cutting out red meat we would have grilled steak or stir fry or stew; now it\u2019s completely beyond my purse. I shop by price, whatever is on sale and chicken and pork are often reasonable, but I would say even they are a once-weekly ingredient. Produce has shot up, a 5lb bag of carrots has gone from $2.99 to $4.99. A loaf of bread is now $4.99. I used to consistently pay $2.99 before Covid and inflation. Now it\u2019s summer, we eat lots of things from our garden and veggies grown by neighbors who are eager to share. As I am over 65, I shop at a store that gives older people 10% off on Tuesdays. I use coupons but only buy what I need and normally buy. I am trying harder not to waste anything and often freeze leftovers. Lisa, 66, semi-retired paralegal, Middletown, Maryland \u2018We\u2019ve planted a garden from heirloom seeds\u2019 We\u2019re trying to rely on more cheap vegan options for protein. We\u2019re not buying as many processed foods, instead buying dried beans, rice, lentils in bulk bins and then just having to plan way ahead so that we can prepare food from these dried ingredients. Don\u2019t be scared of dried beans, you can make so many yummy things and it\u2019s so much less expensive. Plus, rice is an inexpensive way to fill up a kid\u2019s never-ending stomach. One of everyone\u2019s favorite meals is a red lentil curry with rice and naan, which is also one of the least expensive meals to make when you\u2019re using dried lentils and canned chickpeas. We also love doing lentil tacos and Spanish rice. I usually take around an hour at the grocery store but I have my system down pat! I always go to the same grocery store and a map of it exists in my head so my list is in order of the store. It has to be this way or it would take forever as I try to only shop once every two to three weeks, which makes it less likely I\u2019ll buy something on a whim. We\u2019ve also planted a garden from heirloom seeds that should return each year to try to help with the high cost of produce. We\u2019ve invested in chickens for eggs and to help keep the cost down for chicken feed, we give them any excess produce we can\u2019t eat in time from the garden. Cory Forsey, 32, with two school-aged children, director at a startup, Lehi, Utah \u2018All the choices that I make are strictly down to budget\u2019 Right now I shop for, cook for and feed seven. All the choices that I make are strictly down to budget. We purchase two gallons of milk a week at $3.39-$3.89. It used to be $1.89 a gallon. We now spend $30 a month or $1 a day on milk. This is how all grocery staples are: twice the price. Food prices are a huge contribution to our stress and financial insecurity. Majority of the time, my husband and I only eat two meals a day. But I\u2019m pregnant now and I don\u2019t want to skip meals, so I\u2019m trying to be really mindful of getting the nutritional value. The kids always have three. We never buy anything outside the staples unless it is \u201con sale\u201d (AKA the price the product used to be) or clearance. We never buy name-brand or organic. So much of our income is used for food \u2013 we no longer buy new clothes, shoes or new things for us parents. We are in the most credit card debt of our lives. I shop online, mostly Safeway, and search for the lowest price. For example, I select meat, then beef and filter the search result to organize by lowest price. During my pregnancy, I\u2019ve been craving cherries all summer, but they\u2019ve been $5 a pound at the cheapest. I just can\u2019t spend that, even though they would be what I wanted to buy. Every checkout I meticulously decipher the complex coded receipt and always find I have been overcharged (never undercharged) for items with a digital coupon. You do have to carefully read each coupon\u2019s terms because sometimes they are tricky, like you have to buy a totally different product for a deal. And it lets grocery stores advertise that they are saving you money when most people are really just being charged more. SR, 41, Colorado Springs, Colorado \u2018I plan meals around the cheaper items\u2019 Fresh produce has increased significantly in price, while quality has declined. I recently saw a watermelon with seeds selling for $16. While I\u2019ve found some for less, I never imagined a price like that would happen. I make use of sales, clearances and seasonal price reductions, planning meals around the cheaper items. The clearance rack goods aren\u2019t necessarily low-quality, they are often items that just aren\u2019t popular, and marked down before the expiration date. It helps to be flexible in one\u2019s diet, which applies to brand selections as well. Unless there is a definite difference in quality, I\u2019ll buy whichever brand is less expensive. Sorry, MegaFoodBrand, I\u2019m not loyal to any of you. Reducing waste is a key component to keeping the grocery bills low: eat everything you buy, and preserve what you can by freezing, drying or canning to maximize the shelf life. Grow a few vegetables at home if you\u2019re able. Some plants are low-care and prolific producers. Wolfie, Detroit, Michigan \u2018Night of a thousand leftovers\u2019 We\u2019ve been slowly cutting out meat, and I\u2019d describe our diet as flexitarian. We\u2019re also fans of eating leftovers; I make it fancy by calling it \u201cnight of a thousand leftovers\u201d. Want pancakes with pasta? Aces, go for it. I shop at different stores for different items, but thankfully they\u2019re near each other: a Mexican grocery store for produce, Aldi for dairy and other staples, a restaurant supply store if I\u2019m buying meat. I am fortunate to have a car to get around, so the trip will take me at least two hours, and that\u2019s me shopping with surgical precision. Shopping around the holidays makes me apoplectic as it may double shopping times. For all the talk of inflation going down, I\u2019ve not seen it on staples. Bread, milk, cereal, cheese and meat are a killer. Often, stores will put things on sale for the holidays, but most of it is over-processed food like hotdogs, potato chips, soda. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love a good hotdog, but you can\u2019t live on them. I\u2019ve tried. Tracie Bedell, 54, writer and caterer, Chicago, Illinois \u2018I\u2019ve almost completely quit buying things that aren\u2019t good for me\u2019 I probably spend two hours a week grocery shopping, that includes looking at websites and flyers that promote discounts. My Costco membership is valuable because I can\u2019t buy the groceries I get there at similar pricing anywhere else. Processed foods with a lot of added sugar are expensive \u2013 but cheap to make and high-profit items, so I just don\u2019t buy that stuff. With the bad stuff I\u2019ve quit eating or drinking, I can afford the price increases I see on the healthy foods. I often find a type of meat that\u2019s on sale, like chicken or pork, and I\u2019ll get a couple pounds of that to use as the protein in a meal in my slow cooker and fill the rest of it with dried beans that were soaked overnight. Bananas have remained steady or gone down in price. I would guess it\u2019s because it\u2019s perishable, but that has not been the case with avocados. Vexing because I like them and they don\u2019t keep very long. I\u2019ve almost completely quit buying things that aren\u2019t good for me. But I do buy stuff I shouldn\u2019t eat when it\u2019s discounted back to regular pricing \u201con sale\u201d. Notably, ice-cream. Tim, 71, semi-retired, San Diego, California \u2018I spread my shopping around to three grocery stores\u2019 I see three types of grocery price increases: price increases based on product value, such as organic, no artificial coloring, no hydrogenated fats; inflation, such as wages and other costs of doing business; and corporate gouging. I am very loyal to the stores and companies that treat me fairly. But gouging-level price increases at my usual grocery store are so egregious, that company is no longer my friend. Now, I spread my shopping around to three other grocery stores; two of them are within half a mile of each other, the third is 11 miles away. For non-food items such as dog food or over-the-counter medication medications and supplies, I sit at my computer and search the internet for the best deal. As for giving anything up? We continue to maintain our food and nutrition level, but we now rarely eat out at restaurants, and have even cut down on cherished coffee shop visits.

            "date": "2024-08-10T16:00:47Z",
            "content": "We should care more about being overcharged for the things we buy. After three years when UK shop prices have rocketed by about 20%, it is reasonable to examine whether the extra cost is justified and whether the government should have done more to protect us. From the evidence it is clear that in too many cases the extra cost cannot be justified and governments have failed to intervene, doing much to undermine the foundations of social democracy. At the heart of the problem is the trend towards monopoly that characterises many of our most important industries \u2013 those where large companies have acquired huge marketing power and have found ways to cajole, entice and even bamboozle their customers to enhance their profits. Some industry giants are household names, like Google, Amazon, Nestl\u00e9 and Procter &amp; Gamble. Others lurk in the shadows, acting as brokers or distributors. Well-known or shadowy, they all make billions of pounds in profits and distribute large proportions of their gains to senior management. They protect their income streams by buying rivals, lobbying politicians and using the latest marketing methods to convince their customers they are getting a good deal. Google is a good example and last week the US authorities signalled a clampdown on its monopolistic activities. In what is considered to be the most important anti-trust case for at least two decades, Judge Amit Mehta found that Google\u2019s 95% stranglehold on the search engine market was achieved by blocking almost every avenue to rival products, allowing it to dominate advertising sales. With a stock market value of about $2tn, making it bigger than the annual income of Australia, South Korea or Spain, Google\u2019s owner Alphabet has the resources to appeal and has said it will. One can only hope that the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, which first brought the case to the courts almost a year ago, refuse to buckle and continue to scrutinise big tech companies for alleged monopolistic practices. To show the case is not isolated, Amazon is also under scrutiny for allegedly abusing its power as a monopolist. Again, the lawsuit is about Amazon\u2019s search function, and how it allegedly artificially inflated the prices paid by consumers. One complaint asserts that Amazon makes discount sellers invisible on its online marketplace in favour of its own registered sellers when a customer types in a search term. Amazon denies the allegations. These are the systemic and systematic methods used to maintain high prices. Rivals are kept at bay and the potential for lower prices is denied. As if this wasn\u2019t bad enough, the past three years have seen a form of exploitation that capitalises on a crisis to make lots of money. Isabella Weber, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, calls it \u201csellers\u2019 inflation\u201d, which happens when the corporate sector manages to pass on a major cost shock to consumers by increasing prices to protect or enhance its profit margins. This happens even when the increase in raw materials or other costs have abated, but the company claims it is still affected. Nestl\u00e9 improved its margins during the pandemic and so did Procter &amp; Gamble. They were not alone and inflation went up as firms with market power told shoppers they, and not investors, would pick up the tab. However, only oil and gas companies, Shell and BP among them, were singled out for windfall taxes. Politicians understand little of these trends and that\u2019s because economists in positions of power believe in markets. They believe any interference will have little effect. Weber has highlighted the case of shipping companies, which profited from a jump in the demand for goods, including medical supplies, during the pandemic. Can it be true that the only way to overcome a rise in shipping costs when the next crisis hits will be to increase the number of container ships, even though that will take years and no government is going to build them and park them in a port ready for an emergency? She reckons shipping costs added a full two percentage points to inflation between 2021 and 2022. Surely the solution is for governments to take a large slice of the profits and use it to subsidise prices? Otherwise, the combined effect of sustained monopolies, highlighted by the Google and Amazon cases, and the profiteering seen during the recent crisis, will push low- and middle-income household finances to the edge. Politicians need to prevent profiteering year in year out, and tackle it when there is a crisis, or risk a transfer of wealth from consumers to investors that destabilises previously healthy economies. At the moment, politicians in the UK don\u2019t acknowledge there is a problem. The Competition and Markets Authority has blocked several mergers, but its resources are stretched and it lacks the kind of political backing to crack down on corporate influence that regulators in the EU and US have. That needs to change."

            "date": "2024-08-23T06:30:27Z",
            "content": "If you were under the impression that the opposite of a cynic is an easily hoodwinked person of low mental horsepower, then Jamil Zaki, a professor of psychology and director of Stanford\u2019s Social Neuroscience Lab, has news for you. The idea that cynics are somehow more astute is the first of many notions demolished in this succinct, uplifting book. Cynics perform less well in cognitive tests and \u201chave a harder time spotting liars than non-cynics\u201d. They are wrong more often than optimists, and the damage to their wellbeing, and to society, is higher than that incurred by their hopeful counterparts. Like an autoimmune disease, what starts out as a misguided defensive reaction ends up causing self-harm. (Zaki is careful early on to distinguish between \u201cbig-c\u201d Cynics of the ancient philosophical tradition, and the cynicism \u201cmost of us know today\u201d \u2013 which can be summarised as a lack of faith in our fellow humans.) Zaki has been studying \u201chuman goodness\u201d, and illuminating how connection, empathy and kindness operate in the world for the past 20 years. His team have found that most people are basically pretty decent, valuing \u201ccompassion over selfishness\u201d. Donating money lights up the brain just like eating chocolate, and \u201chelping others through stress soothes our own\u201d. This is a refreshing contrast to the modern, highly individualised conception of \u201cself-care\u201d, which, unmoored from community and solidarity, has mutated into the sad fetishism of bubble baths and misinterpretation of party invitations as demands for \u201cemotional labour\u201d. Cynicism is bad for us on several levels. Cynics are sicker, more depressed, drink more and die younger than their less cynical counterparts. On a societal level, \u201cstudy after study finds that cynical beliefs eat away at relationships, communities, economies, and society itself\u201d. Conversely, people who live in high-trust communities are longer-lived, healthier and happier \u2013 benefits Zaki translates into the equivalent of a 40% pay rise. And yet, over a 50-year period, cynicism has risen dramatically. The proportion of Americans agreeing that \u201cmost people can be trusted\u201d fell by 20% between 1972 and 2018. Zaki\u2019s data focuses on the US, but his findings can certainly be applied more widely. This \u201ctrust recession\u201d has serious social consequences. Zaki introduces various juicy phenomena linked to cynicism, including populism, conspiracy theories and political polarisation. He rejects the notion that cynicism is a radical, stick-it-to-the-man worldview, reframing it as a \u201ctool of the status quo\u201d wielded by propagandists to foment distrust and increase elite control. He explores how and why an apparently ordinary California woman fell prey to QAnon, touching on the psychology underlying our most basic existential needs. He makes a link to attachment theory \u2013 ideas about how the way we are attuned towards caregivers from infancy can set the pattern for our adult lives and relationships. Zaki also highlights the fact that economic inequality \u2013 regardless of the total overall wealth in a nation \u2013 erodes trust. People who live in more unequal places \u201ctend to be polarised, hostile, stressed, lonely, materialistic and mistrustful.\u201d Much of Hope for Cynics chimes with the late epidemiologist Hans Rosling\u2019s work. Like Rosling, Zaki claims our perceptions of how terrible the world is and the statistics themselves are wildly mismatched. Bad news gets far more clicks than good, after all. For example, data shows that public perception of rates of violent crime has risen steadily since 1990, while actual figures show rates of violent crime falling overall. Yet both Zaki and Rosling\u2019s arguments raise the same gnawing doubt. Despite the buoyancy of their message, the world is nevertheless full of people experiencing horrific, avoidable suffering. This demands feeling and action from the rest of us. By settling into a sense that the world isn\u2019t all that bad, really, we risk slumping into inexcusable inaction. Zaki addresses this, saying he has worried that hope might be \u201cthe sweetener that helps oppression go down easier\u201d. But it feels like an inadequate afterthought given what is happening presently in Gaza, Sudan and Congo. Perhaps his invocation of \u201chope mixed with fury\u201d strikes a better balance. As much as being eternally optimistic could induce stagnation, the paralysis that despair invites can be far worse. Zaki\u2019s choice of epigraph by Rebecca Solnit offers a way forward: \u201cHope is not a lottery ticket you can sit on the sofa and clutch \u2026 [It] is an axe you break down doors with in an emergency.\u201d \u2022 Hope for Cynics: The Surprising Science of Human Goodness by Jamil Zaki is published by Robinson (\u00a322).

            "content": "The job listings portal Seek has flagged a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in job advertisements, sparking hot competition for a dwindling number of roles. Revenue derived from Seek\u2019s Australian and New Zealand operations dropped 8% to $840m over the financial year as ad volumes fell 20%. The recruitment platform earns the majority of its income from organisations who pay to list jobs on its sites. Weaker than expected job ad volumes weighed heavily on Seek\u2019s overall result as annual earnings fell 13% to $483m, prompting a double-digit sell-down in the company\u2019s stock early on Tuesday. The chief executive of Seek, Ian Narev, said he expected paid ad volumes to keep falling in Australia and New Zealand this financial year \u201cbased on our historical experience of similar conditions\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup There is currently heightened interest in job numbers, with any significant rise in the 4.1% unemployment rate to push Australia closer to a recession. The Reserve Bank factors in the jobless rate when making interest rate decisions. The Bureau of Statistics will release new jobs data on Thursday. A jump in the US jobless rate to 4.3% earlier this month triggered volatility on global share markets over fears the world\u2019s biggest economy could fall into recession. In its recent jobs report, Seek found ad volumes had fallen well over 20% in Victoria and New South Wales, led by weakness in the hospitality, tourism and technology sectors. This had resulted in more applications per job ad, creating \u201cextremely high\u201d competition for roles. E&amp;P Capital analyst Entcho Raykovski described Seek\u2019s financials as a \u201cweaker than expected\u201d and noted its \u201cguidance will disappoint\u201d. Many Australian corporates are now releasing their annual earnings, offering insight into how companies are trying to attract consumers grappling with high living expenses. While the early pandemic shopping boom saw many retailers expand profit margins by charging customers more, there are now signs consumers have the upper hand. Retailers Myer and Nick Scali have released subdued figures, while electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi has boosted its discount and promotional activity to retain customers. Mark Coulter, the chief executive of Temple &amp; Webster, said on Tuesday the furniture and homewares retailer had \u201cbucked the trend\u201d by delivering improved results despite significant cost-of-living pressures on customers. The retailer recorded a 26% lift in revenue over the financial year, although its profit margins have narrowed."

            "date": "2024-08-15T12:33:26Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy has extended its recovery from recession after recording growth of 0.6% in the three months to June, handing a boost to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in the run-up to the autumn budget. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show gross domestic product continued to grow in the second quarter, after a rise of 0.7% in the first three months of 2024. The reading matched the forecasts of City economists. However, monthly GDP growth was flat in June as wet weather deterred shoppers from spending in what has been a washout summer for retailers. Ben Jones, the lead economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said the figures showed the economy had \u201cfinally shaken off its slumber of recent years\u201d, but warned there were still challenges to sustainably boosting Britain\u2019s long-term growth rate. \u201cWe think the quarterly data probably overstates the underlying momentum in the economy, with recent CBI surveys of activity remaining fairly subdued,\u201d he said. \u201cBut firms nonetheless appear confident that the recovery will continue.\u201d According to the latest snapshot, service sector output increased by 0.8% in the second quarter, powered by scientific research and development. There was also strength in the IT, transport, law, architecture and engineering sectors. Consumer-facing service output fell by 0.1%, reflecting a weaker period for purchases of physical goods amid the cost of living crisis and poor weather hitting retail sales. Manufacturing and construction output also fell. The UK has grown at a faster pace this year than many forecasters predicted, in a development seized on by the shadow chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, as evidence that the previous government had helped the economy to turn a corner. \u201cToday\u2019s figures are yet further proof that Labour have inherited a growing and resilient economy. The chancellor\u2019s attempt to blame her economic inheritance on her decision to raise taxes \u2013 tax rises she had always planned \u2013 will not wash with the public,\u201d he said. The latest figures show the UK recorded the strongest growth in the G7 group of advanced economies over the past six months. The second-quarter growth rate of 0.6% compares with 0.3% in the eurozone, and 0.7% in the US. However, it comes after a lacklustre performance over the past decade, and high living costs, elevated interest rates and faltering productivity gains are acting as a brake on momentum. The UK economy entered recession \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of falling GDP \u2013 in the second half of last year as households cut back on spending. Reeves has said rebooting the economy is Labour\u2019s number one priority, arguing that stronger growth will help to boost living standards and raise more tax revenue to repair battered public services. The chancellor will deliver an autumn budget on 30 October. \u201cThe new government is under no illusion as to the scale of the challenge we have inherited after more than a decade of low economic growth and a \u00a322bn black hole in the public finances,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why we have made economic growth our national mission and we are taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations, so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of the country better off.\u201d Experts said the recent strength in the economy would be unlikely to last. Earlier this month, the Bank of England raised its growth forecast from 0.5% to 1.25% for 2024, but warned of a weaker medium-term outlook as high interest rates hit activity. Figures released on Wednesday showed inflation rose by less than expected in July to 2.2%. The continued strong GDP growth in the second quarter of the year may mean that the Bank delays interest rate cuts until past September, according to financial market bets. The Bank is expected to leave rates unchanged at 5% when rate-setters meet next month, before making a 0.25%-point rate cut at the following meeting in November. Much of the recent expansion has been driven by a growing population. The latest figures showed GDP per head, an important barometer of living standards, was 0.1% lower than a year earlier in the second quarter, and 0.8% below pre-pandemic levels. Simon Pittaway, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cBritain\u2019s medium-term record is far less impressive, and has been driven by a growing population rather than rising productivity. \u201cWithout a return to productivity growth, living standards will continue to stagnate and Britain will continue to fall behind its peers.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-29T04:00:22Z",
            "content": "More 15-year-olds are reporting low life satisfaction in the UK than anywhere else in Europe, amid what experts are describing as a \u201chappiness recession\u201d for British teenagers. The group is at the bottom of European rankings in terms of life satisfaction across 27 nations, analysis by the Children\u2019s Society reveals. In the UK 25% of 15-year-olds reported low life satisfaction, compared with 7% of Dutch children of the same age \u2013 the lowest level among any of the countries surveyed. British girls are particularly affected, as are children from disadvantaged backgrounds, with food poverty highlighted as a key reason behind the poor wellbeing numbers. \u201cAlarm bells are ringing,\u201d said Mark Russell, the chief executive of the Children\u2019s Society. \u201cUK teenagers are facing a happiness recession, with 15-year-olds recording the lowest life satisfaction on average across 27 European nations.\u201d In 2021-22, children aged 10 to 15 recorded mean scores for happiness with their life as a whole, as well as with their friends, appearance, school and schoolwork, that were all significantly lower than in 2009-10, the report found. Levels of low life satisfaction are at least twice as high among UK 15-year-olds as among their peers in Finland, Denmark, Romania, Portugal, Croatia and Hungary. The study uses data from the UK Longitudinal Household Survey from 2021-22 and the OECD\u2019s programme for international student assessment (Pisa) from 2022. The findings come amid growing concern at school absences, long NHS waiting times to receive mental health support and increases in the cost of living in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis pushing more families into poverty. \u201cChildren and young people deserve better,\u201d the report says. \u201cDecisive action and national leadership are needed to overturn the decline in children\u2019s wellbeing. We know that these experiences are not lived in a vacuum \u2026 The pandemic, rising levels of poverty, concerns over young people\u2019s safety, the climate emergency and other stresses have put a strain on young people\u2019s lives and can prevent the experience of a happy and fulfilled childhood.\u201d Dutch teenagers have ranked as among the happiest in the world for several years, with supportive parents, low inequality, teachers who are not authoritarian but accept the feelings of pupils, and high levels of self-determination \u2013 for example cycling to school and being allowed to decide when to come home. At the weekend the TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp sparked a debate about whether parents who restrict teenagers\u2019 freedom were \u201cinfantilising\u201d them, after social services contacted her after she allowed her then 15-year-old to go Interrailing in Europe independently. \u201cBeing trusted, being confident, makes you feel better about yourself and happy,\u201d she said. \u201cSo are our kids anxious because we are fearful, we are holding them back, and this is leading them to be depressed?\u201d On Tuesday the Guardian revealed more than 500 children a day in England were being referred to NHS mental health services for anxiety, more than double the rate of before the pandemic began. The Children\u2019s Society study, published on Thursday, also revealed that the largest gap in life satisfaction between the most and least disadvantaged 15-year-olds was in the UK. The charity found many parents were struggling to provide basic necessities for their children, with just over one in five parents and carers finding it difficult to afford a hot meal daily, almost a quarter unable to buy a warm winter coat and just over a quarter struggling to provide daily fresh fruit and vegetables."

            "content": "Stock markets in Europe, Asia and New York tumbled on Friday as fears of a US economic slump grew and technology shares were hit by underwhelming earnings. Concerns that the US could be sliding towards a recession spurred a global sell-off, which accelerated after a poor employment report on Friday showed that the US jobs market was cooling fast, pushing up the unemployment rate. Economists fear the US economy could be weaker than central bankers at the Federal Reserve had realised, and could force the Fed into a sharp cut in borrowing costs in September \u2013 or even an emergency rate cut before that \u2013 to stimulate demand. \u201cThe sharp slowdown in payrolls in July and sharper rise in the unemployment rate makes a September interest rate cut inevitable and will increase speculation that the Fed will kick off its loosening cycle with a 50bp cut or even an intra-meeting move,\u201d said Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics. The weak jobs report added to anxiety after data this week showed weakness in the US manufacturing sector, and disappointing results from semiconductor maker Intel, which hammered its shares. The tech-focused Nasdaq index lost 2.4% to finish in correction territory \u2013 10% off its record high \u2013 after the latest US non-farm payroll report showed that only 114,000 jobs were created last month, compared with the 175,000 analysts expected. In another blow, the US unemployment rate rose from 4.1% to 4.3%. Japanese equities suffered their worst day since the Covid-19 pandemic rocked markets in 2020; the Nikkei 225 share index tumbled by 5.8% to its lowest closing level since January. The broader Japanese Topix fell 6.1%, Australia\u2019s ASX fell 2.5% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was down 2.1%. Europe\u2019s main stock indices also declined on Friday, with European technology stocks falling to their lowest level in more than six months. France\u2019s CAC 40 hit its lowest level since last November, down over 1%, while Germany\u2019s Dax lost 2%. The Dutch chipmaking equipment manufacturer ASML\u2019s shares fell 9.6%, while the rival ASM International dropped 13.7%. \u201cThe past 24 hours have seen an increasingly precarious backdrop for risk markets, with a risk-off mood on the back of another batch of weak US data yesterday followed by mostly downbeat tech earnings overnight,\u201d said Jim Reid, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, on Friday morning. In London, the FTSE 100 blue-chip share index lost more than 120 points at one stage, down 1.5%. Friday\u2019s sell-off followed a rough day\u2019s trading on Wall Street on Thursday, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.2%, or almost 500 points. This was triggered by data showing US manufacturing activity dropped to an eight-month low in July amid a slump in new orders, and a jump in the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits to an 11-month high. New orders for US-manufactured goods fell by 3.3% in June, data on Friday showed, adding to anxiety that economic demand was tailing off. The Fed left US interest rates on hold on Wednesday, but hinted that a rate cut was close. Financial markets are now pricing in a 100% chance that the Fed will cut rates in September, with a large, half-point cut seen as a 60% chance after the weak jobs report. \u201cThe Fed remain wary about inflation, but this week\u2019s employment cost index and unit labour cost data should really have boosted their confidence that inflation is on the path to 2%. Their focus needs to be the state of the jobs market,\u201d said James Knightley, ING\u2019s chief international economist. The US dollar weakened, lifting the pound by 0.5% to $1.28, and the euro by 1.2% to $1.092. Intel\u2019s shares plunged over 28% after it announced plans to cut more than 15,000 jobs globally as it tries to \u201cresize and refocus\u201d its business. Amazon shares were down 10% after it missed sales forecasts and disappointed analysts with its latest outlook. Shares in the chipmaker Nvidia fell 2.7% after a report that the US Department of Justice had launched an investigation into complaints from competitors that it may have abused its market dominance in selling chips that power artificial intelligence. Russ Mould, an investment director at AJ Bell, said rising economic pessimism meant August had got off to a bad start for global stock markets. \u201cAn economy going through a bad patch is one catalyst for a central bank to cut rates and hopefully stimulate activity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis thought process is likely to be at the top of the agenda for the Fed this week after shocking US economic data that featured bigger than expected jobless claims and contraction in manufacturing. The narrative has changed from rate cuts equating to good news to rate cuts meaning measures to avoid recession.\u201d While shares slid, gold hit a fresh record on Friday as investors flocked to safe-haven assets. Gold futures at one point on Friday were up $25.70 (\u00a320.17), or 1%, to $2,506.40 an ounce."

            "content": "While most of the nation were enjoying the late August sunshine and the news that Oasis are getting back together, it seemed an odd moment for Keir Starmer to bring everyone back down to earth with a bump. But his gloom-laden speech in the Downing Street garden on Tuesday did just that. \u201cI have to be honest with you: things are worse than we ever imagined,\u201d the prime minister told his hand-picked audience. The finger of blame was again pointed firmly at the Conservatives, whom he accused of leaving behind an economic and societal \u201cblack hole\u201d. \u201cThat is why we have to take action and do things differently,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of that is being honest with people \u2013 about the choices we face. And how tough this will be. Frankly, things will get worse before they get better.\u201d Starmer\u2019s message \u2013 delivered from a podium emblazoned with the words \u201cFixing the foundations\u201d \u2013 set off a ripple of anxiety among Labour MPs, many of whom have been desperate for the government to offer some hope after their landslide election victory. \u201cWe\u2019ve just won power for the first time in 14 years. Surely that in itself is a reason for optimism?\u201d one remarked after the speech. Another MP said: \u201cIf you can\u2019t achieve radical change to improve people\u2019s lives with a majority of 167, then when can you?\u201d Several cited the contrast with the unbridled enthusiasm on show at the Democrat National Convention in Chicago the week before, where buoyant US presidential candidate Kamala Harris received a rockstar reception. One senior minister said that the electorate, having put their faith in Labour improving their lot, would expect to see results soon or would punish the party at the ballot box. \u201cWe don\u2019t have as long as No 10 thinks. If people aren\u2019t feeling things are better in the next couple of years, that\u2019s a big problem,\u201d they said. Others were concerned that Starmer\u2019s downbeat approach could depress consumer and business confidence to the extent that it undermines his own strategy for getting the country back on track: economic growth. \u201cThe miserablism is completely self-defeating,\u201d warned one MP. \u201cWe need to be bigging Britain up. It feels like we\u2019re doing the opposite.\u201d But Downing Street insiders brushed aside MPs\u2019 jitters. \u201cThey need to get over it,\u201d said one source. \u201cThe public is sick of boosterism. Boris Johnson overpromising and underdelivering is a big factor in why people have lost faith in politics.\u201d Another senior Labour insider said: \u201cKeir can\u2019t make everything fine just by saying it\u2019s all great. He would rather level with people and explain the trade-offs, not pretend. I don\u2019t agree that he\u2019s unnecessarily gloomy or that he doesn\u2019t \u2018do hope\u2019. He\u2019s saying that change is coming, but it\u2019s just going to take time.\u201d Some inside No 10 acknowledge that Starmer and his ministers need to do a better job of explaining the tough choices to the public. One figure admits they may even have overdone the gloom in recent days. After the government sent out Pat McFadden last weekend to roll the pitch for Starmer\u2019s speech, they conceded that the Cabinet Office minister, who \u201ccould make an undertaker look cheerful\u201d, was perhaps not the best choice. Starmer\u2019s speech had originally been planned for the week the riots broke out, sources said. It was intended as a follow-up to Rachel Reeves\u2019 own speech to MPs in July, when she emphasised the now familiar \u201cinheritance\u201d narrative. Downing Street hopes that by the time the budget \u2013 with its expected tax rises and Whitehall cuts \u2013 bites at the end of October, the public will be prepared for the pain to come. However, aides denied that their carefully honed message was all just expectation management. \u201cThings are going to be really tough,\u201d one said. Several departments have had to push announcements they had planned for the first few weeks of government into the next fiscal year because they can\u2019t afford them, sources said. But the two most recognisable figures in his cabinet this week showed some recognition that hope is needed. Reeves gave what one MP described as a \u201ctub-thumping spiel\u201d on how the economy would improve under Labour in a private meeting during a visit to Scotland. She is also expected to say more about growth in the weeks ahead, reminding people of the steps the government has already taken. \u201cIt\u2019s tough, there\u2019s a lot more to do, but we\u2019ll start seeing the hard work paying off,\u201d one government insider said. \u201cIt won\u2019t all be doom and gloom for ever.\u201d And in the small hours of Thursday morning, Starmer\u2019s deputy, Angela Rayner, was filmed dancing in an DJ booth in Ibiza, drink in hand. All it needed was some Oasis."

            "date": "2024-08-23T04:00:24Z",
            "content": "At al-Salam glass and ceramics factory on the outskirts of Hebron, the glassblowing furnace and the potter\u2019s wheel are no longer in daily use; the room where artists decorate bowls and tiles with the traditional blues, yellows and reds of the Palestinian craft is sometimes empty. The glass panes of one window and a door now bear the unmistakable spiderweb-like holes created by gunfire. Israeli soldiers at a nearby checkpoint fired live bullets at teenagers and young men throwing stones in an altercation a few weeks ago, said the factory\u2019s owner, Sami al-Nader. Hebron, a city in the south of the occupied West Bank, is far from the fighting between Hamas and Israel that has raged in the Gaza Strip for 10 months. But violence between Palestinians and the Israeli army and settlers in the West Bank has also reached a level not seen for 20 years, and new restrictions such as road closures, lockdowns and the cancellation of thousands of Israel work permits are suffocating the economy and daily life. \u201cThe pandemic does not compare to what our business is going through now. We used to welcome tourists every day, and now, if we are lucky, we sell things on Saturdays only. We are not even getting online orders, because no one in Palestine has any money,\u201d said Nader, 47. \u201cMy family has owned the factory for more than 70 years. I do not want it to close under my watch.\u201d For better or worse, the Israeli and Palestinian economies are deeply intertwined: Israel relies on cheaper Palestinian labour, particularly in construction and agriculture, and before the war higher Israeli wages generated an estimated 20% of the Palestinian Authority\u2019s (PA) GDP. In 2022, these workers contributed \u00a33.05bn to the Palestinian economy, two-thirds of the PA\u2019s total budget. After the Hamas attacks of 7 October, however, Israel suspended entry for about 140,000 Palestinian workers from the West Bank. Only a fraction of those have since been restored, and Israel is trying to plug the gap with labourers from India. As a result, unemployment and poverty in the West Bank have soared, putting the already unstable territory on the brink of a financial crash and fuelling unrest. In the West Bank\u2019s refugee camps, set up after the creation of Israel in 1948 and even today still slum-like, young men told the Guardian that militant groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were the only employers they could find. Unemployment in the first quarter of 2024 was up 11% to 35% year on year, according to the International Labour Organization, and the UN estimates a 13- to 16-year setback in human development. Inflation is up, the PA has slashed salaries and cut workers, and Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, is withholding tax funds to the PA as a punitive measure for its cooperation with the international criminal court in The Hague. He has also repeatedly threatened to cut off Palestinian banks from the international banking system, which would cause the PA to collapse altogether. \u201cAll Israeli administrations use the stick and the carrot with the PA, but the current government is pursuing particularly contradictory policies. Israel needs the PA to maintain security in the West Bank and protect settlers but they are leveraging what they can,\u201d said Tahani Mustafa, a senior Palestine analyst at the Crisis Group thinktank. \u201cThe other logic is that of collective punishment: although it\u2019s not worked in the past they seem to still believe that if you impose an economic siege, and a siege on movement, and squeeze the people enough, they will obey.\u201d In Nahalin, a Palestinian village south of Jerusalem, father and son Mahmood and Yaqoub Dadouh, both skilled marble and stone workers, now spend most of their days doing projects in the garden. The lights are off in Mahmood\u2019s huge kitchen and bathroom materials warehouse next door; he used to mainly supply Israelis from the nearby settlement of Beitar Illit, but not a single customer has come for the better part of a year. Yaqoub, a father of two small girls, said he was still owed 16,000 shekels (\u00a33,300) from a project in Israel that was cancelled after 7 October. The contractor is refusing to take his calls. \u201cWe\u2019ve already sold all of the gold, the jewellery. It was heartbreaking asking my wife to do that,\u201d said Yaqoub, 29. \u201cI think we can manage with our savings for another two months. After that I have no idea what we are going to do.\u201d There is no reliable data, but in the past few years people in the West Bank have begun finding ways to get through Israel\u2019s various security barriers into Israel without permits, in search of better-paid work. It is a dangerous decision, but an estimated 40,000 Palestinians are still making the journey, sometimes staying in Israel undocumented for weeks at a time. A cousin of the Dadouhs found work on a construction site in southern Israel a few weeks ago, the pair said. He has no insurance or rights and risks being caught, but is at least able to send money to his family. \u201cI think the situation is not sustainable,\u201d Yacoub said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want us any more \u2013 then end the occupation and let us work for ourselves.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-18T07:00:22Z",
            "content": "Ministers could find ways to boost the economy and improve public services by combining data from separate government departments, according to the head of the UK\u2019s statistics watchdog. Sir Robert Chote, the chair of the UK Statistics Authority, said that too often government data was \u201csiloed\u201d because departments and other bodies were worried that people may uncover weaknesses in the data or even reach inconvenient conclusions. He also warned that gathering official data was becoming harder as a result of budget cuts and because people were less willing to respond to surveys. But he said that the \u201cunrealised potential\u201d of sharing and linking data could help the government generate new ideas and improve its policies. Writing in the Observer, Chote said: \u201cDuring the pandemic, the sense of national emergency provided an urgent impetus for sharing data. This enabled valuable insights, such as identifying where to target communication campaigns to increase vaccine uptake. \u201cBut since then, the system has not fully capitalised on similar opportunities. Many gains remain untapped.\u201d Other examples include the Better Outcomes through Linked Data programme, which found that offenders with alcohol or drug problems were 10 times more likely to take their own lives than the general population in England and Wales. Using data from the Ministry of Justice, Department of Health and Social Care and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, it also discovered that those deaths may be reduced by speeding up access to treatment. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been starting to collect more data from private companies to create its official figures. This month, it revealed it had started using anonymised data from supermarket scanners to check inflation as well as data on cars and train fares respectively from Auto Trader and the Rail Delivery Group. It similarly takes anonymised Visa data to track credit and debit card spending to inform its travel and tourism research, and also uses live PAYE data from HM Revenue and Customs to give a more accurate number of people in work. Yet these examples are still too rare, Chote said. Too often departments and other bodies were more concerned about the downsides of sharing information, such as risks to privacy, as well as to the reputation of bodies \u201cif weaknesses in their own data are revealed or if they are used to reach conclusions or narratives that the institution or its leadership finds inconvenient\u201d. Chote also warned that the ONS and other data gatherers were \u201cunder greater strain\u201d, partly because of tight budgets. \u201cIt is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to maintain the quality of the household surveys that we rely on to understand important parts of the economy and society because of falling response rates and higher collection costs, a trend seen by other statistics agencies across the world,\u201d he said.Last year, the ONS suddenly stopped publishing monthly jobs data from the labour force survey because of concerns that the response rate made the figures unreliable. The survey is used to estimate unemployment and jobs data, which in turn forms part of the Bank of England\u2019s decisions about interest rates."

            "content": "Vice-president and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris unveiled her economic campaign proposal in North Carolina to build what she called an \u201copportunity economy\u201d focused on the middle class. She said in Raleigh: \u201cYour salary should be enough to provide you and your family with a good quality of life \u2026 such as, no child should have to grow up in poverty. Such as, after years of hard work, you should be able to retire with dignity, and you should be able to join a union if you choose.\u201d To lower the cost of living, Harris told the rally she intends to cut needless bureaucracy and red tape, pursue investigations of anti-competitive behavior in the food supply, and propose a federal ban on price-gouging in food. Harris said inflation had fallen below 3% for the first time since March 2021, according to a recent federal report. \u201cOur supply chains have now improved, and prices are still too high,\u201d Harris said. \u201cMany of the big food companies are seeing their highest profits in two decades. And while many grocery chains pass along these savings, others still aren\u2019t. \u201cLook, I know most businesses are creating jobs, contributing to our economy and playing by the rules. But some are not, and that\u2019s just not right. And we need to take action when that\u2019s the case.\u201d Harris\u2019s comments came before next week\u2019s Democratic national convention in Chicago, where political observers might expect to hear more detail about her economic agenda. North Carolina is also a particular focal point for the new campaign. Barack Obama was the last Democratic presidential candidate to win North Carolina, eking out a win by a 0.32-percentage-point margin in 2008. Recent polling suggests North Carolina is close enough to contest in 2024, and even more so after Harris replaced Joe Biden when he dropped out in late July. Harris said she had visited the state 16 times as vice-president. In her speech, Harris said she had worked at McDonald\u2019s in her youth and understood the struggle of low-wage work, and that she worked as California\u2019s attorney general to lower drug prices and to go after predatory lending in the housing market. Red tape and barriers are constraining the housing supply, she said. \u201cBy the end of my first term, we will end America\u2019s housing shortage by building 3m new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we will make sure those homes actually go to working and middle-class Americans, not just investors.\u201d The purchase of single-family housing by corporate landlords in the real estate investment trust financial sector has become a significant national political issue. \u201cIt can make it impossible then for regular people to buy or even rent a home,\u201d Harris said, noting accusations of collusion raised by ProPublica in an investigation of the use of RealPage software. The Federal Trade Commission and US Department of Justice filed a joint legal brief in March addressing their concerns about algorithmic price fixing. \u201cIt\u2019s anti-competitive, and it drives up costs,\u201d she said. \u201cI will fight for a law that cracks down on these practices.\u201d Harris also proposed a $25,000 grant for first-time homebuyers to help with down-payments. \u201cUnder my plan, more than 100 million Americans would get a tax cut,\u201d Harris said, proposing a return of the earned income tax credit and child tax credit, and a $6,000 tax credit for new parents. She contrasted her proposals to Donald Trump\u2019s support for the FairTax, a national sales tax intended to replace income tax, and said taxpayers would pay thousands more under the proposals contained in the Project 2025 manifesto. \u201cHe [Trump] plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts year after year,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he plans to cut corporate taxes by over $1tn, even as they pull in record profits. And that\u2019s on top of the $2tn tax cut he already signed into law as president, which, by the way, overwhelmingly went to the wealthiest Americans and corporations, and exploded the national deficit. \u201cI think if you want to know who someone cares about, look who they fight for.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-15T12:33:26Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy has extended its recovery from recession after recording growth of 0.6% in the three months to June, handing a boost to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in the run-up to the autumn budget. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show gross domestic product continued to grow in the second quarter, after a rise of 0.7% in the first three months of 2024. The reading matched the forecasts of City economists. However, monthly GDP growth was flat in June as wet weather deterred shoppers from spending in what has been a washout summer for retailers. Ben Jones, the lead economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said the figures showed the economy had \u201cfinally shaken off its slumber of recent years\u201d, but warned there were still challenges to sustainably boosting Britain\u2019s long-term growth rate. \u201cWe think the quarterly data probably overstates the underlying momentum in the economy, with recent CBI surveys of activity remaining fairly subdued,\u201d he said. \u201cBut firms nonetheless appear confident that the recovery will continue.\u201d According to the latest snapshot, service sector output increased by 0.8% in the second quarter, powered by scientific research and development. There was also strength in the IT, transport, law, architecture and engineering sectors. Consumer-facing service output fell by 0.1%, reflecting a weaker period for purchases of physical goods amid the cost of living crisis and poor weather hitting retail sales. Manufacturing and construction output also fell. The UK has grown at a faster pace this year than many forecasters predicted, in a development seized on by the shadow chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, as evidence that the previous government had helped the economy to turn a corner. \u201cToday\u2019s figures are yet further proof that Labour have inherited a growing and resilient economy. The chancellor\u2019s attempt to blame her economic inheritance on her decision to raise taxes \u2013 tax rises she had always planned \u2013 will not wash with the public,\u201d he said. The latest figures show the UK recorded the strongest growth in the G7 group of advanced economies over the past six months. The second-quarter growth rate of 0.6% compares with 0.3% in the eurozone, and 0.7% in the US. However, it comes after a lacklustre performance over the past decade, and high living costs, elevated interest rates and faltering productivity gains are acting as a brake on momentum. The UK economy entered recession \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of falling GDP \u2013 in the second half of last year as households cut back on spending. Reeves has said rebooting the economy is Labour\u2019s number one priority, arguing that stronger growth will help to boost living standards and raise more tax revenue to repair battered public services. The chancellor will deliver an autumn budget on 30 October. \u201cThe new government is under no illusion as to the scale of the challenge we have inherited after more than a decade of low economic growth and a \u00a322bn black hole in the public finances,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why we have made economic growth our national mission and we are taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations, so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of the country better off.\u201d Experts said the recent strength in the economy would be unlikely to last. Earlier this month, the Bank of England raised its growth forecast from 0.5% to 1.25% for 2024, but warned of a weaker medium-term outlook as high interest rates hit activity. Figures released on Wednesday showed inflation rose by less than expected in July to 2.2%. The continued strong GDP growth in the second quarter of the year may mean that the Bank delays interest rate cuts until past September, according to financial market bets. The Bank is expected to leave rates unchanged at 5% when rate-setters meet next month, before making a 0.25%-point rate cut at the following meeting in November. Much of the recent expansion has been driven by a growing population. The latest figures showed GDP per head, an important barometer of living standards, was 0.1% lower than a year earlier in the second quarter, and 0.8% below pre-pandemic levels. Simon Pittaway, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cBritain\u2019s medium-term record is far less impressive, and has been driven by a growing population rather than rising productivity. \u201cWithout a return to productivity growth, living standards will continue to stagnate and Britain will continue to fall behind its peers.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-12T09:00:36Z",
            "content": "When Elon Musk took over as owner of Twitter, researchers and elections officials feared a rampant spread of misinformation that would lead to threats and harassment and undermine democracy. Their fears came true \u2013 and Musk himself has emerged as one of its main drivers. The tech billionaire has cast doubt on machines that tabulate votes and mail ballots, both common features of US elections. He has repeatedly claimed there is rampant non-citizen voting, a frequent Republican talking point in this election. Musk, the ultra-wealthy owner of Tesla and other tech companies, is scheduled to interview Donald Trump on Monday, where they are sure to find common ground on these election conspiracy theories. Musk is a vocal supporter of the former US president and current Republican nominee. He has restored the Twitter/X accounts of people banned under previous ownership, dismantling the platform\u2019s fact-checking and safety features. Trump\u2019s X account, which was suspended after the January 6 insurrection, was restored as well, though Trump has not returned actively to the platform. \u201cElectronic voting machines and anything mailed in is too risky. We should mandate paper ballots and in-person voting only,\u201d he wrote on X in July. Maricopa county recorder Stephen Richer responded, asking if he could give Musk a tour of the large Arizona county\u2019s facilities and run through the mail voting processes. \u201cYou can go into all the rooms. You can examine all the equipment. You can ask any question you want. We\u2019d love to show you the security steps already in place, which I think are very sound,\u201d Richer said. It was not the only time Richer has sought to correct election misinformation Musk had shared. He previously tried to fix misunderstandings of Arizona voter data and rules for proof of citizenship. Social media platforms overall have taken less aggressive stances on fact-checking election falsehoods after an ongoing campaign by Republican lawmakers and their allies to attack the ways information was flagged by elected officials and researchers and how platforms responded. \u201cI think X really kind of sticks out as a place where that change has been striking, and for it to come from the very top kind of just shows how much of an issue it is,\u201d said Mekela Panditharatne, senior counsel for the Brennan Center\u2019s elections and government program. Musk shared a video that used an AI-generated voice for Kamala Harris, which raised concerns that it could fool some people into thinking it was real. Musk and the video creator defended it as parody. He has also written multiple times claiming that non-citizens are voting in US elections, which is illegal except in a few local elections. There are few instances of non-citizens voting, or even registering to vote. In late July, he shared a video of Elizabeth Warren talking about a pathway to citizenship for the millions of undocumented people living in the US. \u201cAs I was saying, they\u2019re importing voters,\u201d he said, a nod to \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory. Grok, the platform\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot that Musk has billed as an \u201canti-woke\u201d antidote to left-biased chatbots, has spread false information that ballot deadlines had passed in nine states, meaning the vice-president could not get on the ballot in those places, which is untrue. Secretaries of state are urging Musk to fix this issue for the chatbot, which does not have election information guardrails that other chatbots like ChatGPT do. \u201cIt\u2019s important that social media companies, especially those with global reach, correct mistakes of their own making \u2013 as in the case of the Grok AI chatbot simply getting the rules wrong,\u201d Minnesota secretary of state Steve Simon told the Washington Post. \u201cSpeaking out now will hopefully reduce the risk that any social media company will decline or delay correction of its own mistakes between now and the November election.\u201d Off the platform, a political action committee Musk created is mining personal information from voters in key states in what appears to users to initially look like a voter registration portal, CNBC reported. America Pac, a pro-Trump group backed by Musk\u2019s enormous wealth, is targeting swing states voters. The data scraping is now being investigated by at least two states. Despite his endless claims about election fraud, Musk told the Atlantic this month he would accept the results of the 2024 election \u2013 with a caveat. \u201cIf there are questions of election integrity, they should be properly investigated and neither be dismissed out of hand nor unreasonably questioned,\u201d he said. \u201cIf, after review of the election results, it turns out that Kamala wins, that win should be recognized and not disputed.\u201d"

Only the tagline reveals a darker message: \u201cSummer, Sun, Remigration.\u201d As it campaigns for votes in its east German heartland, the AfD has long since embraced the slogan that last winter sent hundreds of thousands of Germans on to the streets in protest against revelations of a rightwing \u201cmaster plan\u201d to deport unwanted foreigners and citizens alike. Three state elections in the region in September will impose a stress test on the country\u2019s democracy, with the AfD and a new populist leftist-conservative force expected to perform exceedingly well in the aftermath of a deadly stabbing attack, allegedly by a Syrian asylum seeker. The anti-migration, anti-Islam AfD could take the most votes in all three regions one year before Germany is scheduled to hold its next general election, and claim up to a third of the vote in the states holding elections this Sunday: Saxony and Thuringia. In both regions, the AfD chapter has been deemed \u201cconfirmed rightwing extremist\u201d by domestic security authorities, and the remaining parties have vowed to keep it out of power with a democratic \u201cfirewall\u201d by refusing cooperation. The campaign has included the remarkable rise of an eight-month-old party built around a veteran far-left firebrand, the B\u00fcndnis Sahra Wagenknecht (Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance). Its blend of scepticism about migration, opposition to Nato, backing for high taxes on the rich and resistance to military aid for Ukraine has struck a chord with the electorate. Given the complex maths of coalition-building in a fractured political landscape, polls indicate the BSW could find itself in the role of kingmaker in any of the three states. Brandenburg, the rural region surrounding Berlin, votes on 22 September. None of the mainstream parties have ruled out working with the BSW, while Wagenknecht has revelled in the lip service many of the candidates are now paying to many of her once taboo views, such as calls for Ukraine to hold immediate peace talks with Russia. The expected strong showing for the two populist parties is likely to sharpen the febrile political mood in Europe\u2019s top economy, and underline the enduring disaffection in the ex-communist east more than three decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall. \u201cBut it would be a mistake to relegate the state votes to \u2018elections in east Germany\u2019,\u201d said Alexander Moritz, a public radio correspondent in Saxony. \u201cThey are a test case for the whole of German democracy. Inflation, fear of war and restrictions on freedom during the pandemic have left many people chronically distressed. For the first time since 1932, rightwing extremists could become the strongest party in a German legislature in a free election.\u201d The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and his centre-left-led coalition were already on the ropes with their dismal popularity ratings nationwide, bitter public infighting and catastrophic polling in the eastern states. Last Friday\u2019s knife attack in the city of Solingen, near D\u00fcsseldorf, which killed three and for which Islamic State claimed responsibility, amplified the sense that the government was failing on two issues high on actual and potential AfD voters\u2019 lists of concerns: immigration and crime. The AfD seized on the tragedy even before the main suspect, Issa al-Hasan, a 26-year-old Syrian who had been slated for deportation last year, surrendered to police. By Sunday Alice Weidel, the co-leader of the party, which is polling at about 17% nationally, was calling for a \u201cfive-year stop to the entrance, registration and naturalisation of migrants\u201d. Pushing back against a perception that the conservative opposition and the far right had taken control of the debate, Scholz pledged stricter laws on carrying knives in public, swifter deportations of rejected asylum seekers and tighter controls on \u201cirregular\u201d migration, but only in accordance with international law. Yet nine years after his predecessor, Angela Merkel, issued her rallying cry of \u201cWe can do it\u201d in response to a historic refugee influx, hardliners appeared to have the upper hand. \u201cGermany is a bit of a latecomer when it comes to the rise of the far-right parties,\u201d said Kai Arzheimer, a political scientist at the University of Mainz. He pointed to the national success of figures such as Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen, Giorgia Meloni, Geert Wilders and Robert Fico in their respective countries while Germany\u2019s \u201cfirewall\u201d held. \u201cWhat\u2019s unusual about the AfD is that, unlike Le Pen in France or Wilders in the Netherlands trying to present themselves as if they have nothing to do with rightwing extremism, the AfD has people in its ranks convicted of using Nazi slogans,\u201d Arzheimer said. \u201cIt appears not to hurt them that they present themselves as so extreme right and particularly in eastern Germany, it appears to be well received.\u201d The face of this trend is Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, the co-leader of the Thuringia AfD chapter. A former history teacher, H\u00f6cke has repeatedly used banned Nazi rhetoric at his rallies while insisting he was unaware of its origins. In a speech to an enthusiastic crowd in the state capital, Erfurt, last week, H\u00f6cke, who has often disparaged Germany\u2019s culture of atonement for the Holocaust as a form of \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cself-hatred\u201d, said he wanted to free his compatriots to express pride. \u201cI believe in a new, honest, vital patriotism \u2013 a nationalism that is normal in any other country\u201d but Germany, he said. Petra Neumann, 68, of the pressure group Grandmothers Against the Right, helped lead a boisterous counter-demonstration against H\u00f6cke, along with young activists. She said she remembered her grandfather waking up in the night screaming when she was a child. \u201cWhen I was 12, he took me to Buchenwald,\u201d the former Nazi concentration camp 12 miles from Erfurt, \u201cand explained how people there were tortured and murdered. He said he had been held at Dachau and that was where the nightmares came from,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a daughter and a granddaughter now and we\u2019re here to ensure they never have to experience fascism.\u201d Although the Solingen killings exposed failings on deportations at EU, federal and state levels, analysts raised doubts about whether they would do much to shift the race given the already strong positioning of the parties. The Thuringia chapter of the AfD, however, was leaving little to chance. Last weekend it began using a simple slogan: \u201cH\u00f6cke or Solingen.\u201d"

            "title": "Lone Democrat on Georgia state board defends elections amid new rules",
            "date": "2024-08-13T10:00:10Z",
            "content": "Sara Tindall Ghazal was scouring her closet as 8pm approached on Wednesday night. She was preparing for her first appearance on cable news, something she has avoided her entire career. In fact, Tindall Ghazal, the lone Democrat on the Georgia state election board (SEB), has shunned media attention and appearances since she was appointed to the board in 2021. Back then, even as Georgia became the focal point of former president Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and as rightwing media and a nationwide network of election denial activists homed in on the state, Tindall Ghazal kept to herself, quietly carrying out her duties in previously obscure meetings of the board. But after two days of public board meetings last week in which her Republican counterparts on the board adopted myriad rules at the behest of some of those very election denier activists, Tindall Ghazal\u2019s cable news debut had become unavoidable. \u201cThe makeup of this board has changed from being a board that followed the rule of law and made decisions based on what state and federal law required, and what was best for running elections, to one that is being driven by far-rightwing narratives,\u201d she said. For more than 16 hours on 6 and 7 August, Tindall Ghazal had sat with her fellow board members, all Republicans, and listened to speakers complain that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump \u2013 and propose rules that would prevent that from happening again in November but that Tindall Ghazal said will \u201ccause chaos\u201d in November. They include a rule that gives local election officials more power to refuse to certify election results, and another that provides more complicated procedures for voters filling out absentee ballots, as well as constant video surveillance at ballot drop box sites. Tindall Ghazal also voted against reopening a case pushed by election deniers that claims results in 2020 in Fulton county were flipped to benefit Joe Biden. Voting with her in dissent was John Fervier, a Republican and the board chair. Voting for the rules and investigation into Fulton county were a trio of Republicans who were praised by Trump at a recent campaign rally in Atlanta. All three have expressed beliefs in widespread election fraud that even conservative groups have said does not exist. \u201cIt\u2019s an iterative process,\u201d Tindall Ghazal said of the SEB\u2019s descent into election denialism. \u201cThe narratives exist already and are deeply embedded in the minds of some of the board members and certainly much of the audience and petitioners, and everything that is done in the meetings is done to perpetuate those narratives.\u201d Just as Tindall Ghazal\u2019s Republican colleagues voted to reopen the case against Fulton county, Trump was already promoting the decision on his social media platform, Truth Social. \u201cThe Attorney General of Georgia MUST get moving on this,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cSo must Governor Kemp, and the Secretary of State.\u201d *** Despite Trump\u2019s Truth Social post, nothing has changed in the Fulton county case. Following his loss in 2020, the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, ordered an audit of votes in Fulton, the state\u2019s most populous county and home to heavily Democratic Atlanta. The audit found 345 more votes for Trump than had been counted during the election. But that didn\u2019t change the fact that Biden had received 243,000 more votes than Trump in Fulton county, the audit confirmed. Still, election deniers like those who have successfully pressured the board in recent years to investigate claims of voter fraud have insisted that the case needs further attention. Last week, they got a major win, when the pro-Trump trio of SEB members Janelle King, Rick Jeffares and Janice Johnston sent the case to the attorney general for a new investigation. \u201cWe take election integrity very seriously, and we will apply the constitution, the law and the facts as we have always done,\u201d a spokesperson for the Georgia attorney general, Chris Carr, a Republican, told the Associated Press. The SEB also passed rules that Tindall Ghazal said were \u201cfar outside our authority as a rule-making body\u201d. Of the rules passed last week, Tindall Ghazal says the most problematic is one that allows for county election board members in Georgia\u2019s 159 counties to refuse to certify results \u2013 which courts have largely ruled is a \u201cministerial\u201d task not up to the discretion of local election officials \u2013 if a \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d can be conducted into allegations of election fraud or errors. \u201cReasonable inquiry is about as uncertain a standard as I can think of,\u201d Tindall Ghazal said. Several Democratic members of the state legislature spoke out against the rule, as did voting rights groups. Former chair of the Fulton county board of elections Cathy Woolard, a Democrat, said that the certification rule will invite scores of lawsuits challenging the ability of county election board members to use their discretion to hold up certification of election results. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to imagine the sheer volume of lawsuits that will be filed to challenge the process, the rules, the disregard for the rule of law,\u201d Woolard said. In voting with Tindall Ghazal against the certification rule, Fervier, a political appointee of the Georgia governor, Brian Kemp, previewed the legal fight ahead over certification. \u201cPlease make sure the votes are in the record for any potential future litigation,\u201d Fervier said at the meeting. At a recent Trump rally in Atlanta, Johnston stood and waved to the crowd as they applauded her, King and Jeffares for \u201cfighting for victory\u201d, as Trump himself put it. \u201cThey\u2019re on fire, they\u2019re doing a great job,\u201d Trump said, naming the three of them but not Fervier. \u201cThree pitbulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory.\u201d *** After a second, eight-hour day on the dais on 7 August, Tindall Ghazal said she needed \u201csome protein\u201d before preparing for her first major television interview. Her hair was already sorted: close-cropped in a growing-out buzz from losing her hair to chemotherapy treatments for stage two breast cancer. Tindall Ghazal received her cancer diagnosis during a meeting of the state election board in October, then had a mastectomy the following month. The episode was \u201ctransformative\u201d, she said, proving that she had a strong network of family and friends to support her. Undergoing the procedure and chemo, Tindall Ghazal never missed an election board meeting. \u201cI don\u2019t do well when I have too much time on my hands, so having the board work kept my mind busy on something that I care deeply about.,\u201d Tindall Ghazal said. An eighth-generation Georgian and attorney, Tindall Ghazal has monitored elections and peace talks for former president Jimmy Carter\u2019s Carter Center in Syria, Rwanda and Liberia, where she met her husband, Patrick, in 1998. After leaving the Carter Center, Tindall Ghazal became the director of voter protection for the Democratic party of Georgia. In 2021, Georgia Democrats appointed her to the SEB. At the time, she knew she\u2019d be the only Democrat \u2013 but she also had faith that Republicans on the board would work for the benefit of all Georgians. For a time, Tindall Ghazal says, that was the case. Republicans had appointed relative moderates to the board. Since 2021, three moderate Republican appointees have been replaced by King, Johnston and Jeffares. Johnston has been receptive to complaints and calls for investigations from election denial activists, the Guardian found in March; Jeffares has openly posted about his belief in Trump\u2019s election lies, although he told the Guardian that he believed Trump legitimately lost in Georgia in 2020. King, a conservative media personality with no experience managing elections, is married to Kelvin King, who ran against the former football star Herschel Walker in the Republican primary in 2022 but lost. (Walker went on to lose to Raphael Warnock in the general election.) King hosts a podcast and appears on a political panel at a TV station in Atlanta, but has no experience administering elections, nor does Jeffares. Leftwing groups like Fair Fight Action, which was founded by the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, a Democrat, said the trio of Johnston, King and Jeffares had been chosen for their roles on the board not because of their experience administering elections, but because of their fealty to Trump. \u201cThe state election board has become a Maga government body, with three new members likely chosen not because they have elections experience, but because they\u2019re seen as loyalists who will defer to Trump\u2019s 2020 election fraud lies,\u201d Fair Fight\u2019s communications director, Max Flugrath, said in a statement. As non-elected officials hearing complaints about elections, ballots and other minutiae of the election process, the SEB was a relatively obscure government body whose meetings have not typically provided scenes of great political theater. But that changed in 2020, when the SEB became the focus of election denial activists\u2019 attempts to prove the election was stolen from Trump. Now the board\u2019s meetings have garnered greater attention from a nationwide network of election deniers, Georgia\u2019s political press, voting rights advocacy groups and left-leaning watchdogs. Trump\u2019s mention of King, Johnston and Jeffares put an even bigger spotlight on the previously obscure body. Johnston, who attended Trump\u2019s rally and waved at the cheering crowd, did not return a request for comment, but King said that while she did not attend the rally, if she had, she was well within her rights to \u201cattend any Republican event freely as I would expect [Tindall Ghazal] to do the same if she wishes\u201d. Jeffares also didn\u2019t attend the rally, he said. In a lengthy conversation with the Guardian, Jeffares, a Trump supporter, said he believed Trump lost fair and square in Georgia in 2020, but repeatedly expressed belief in possible election fraud taking place in the state, especially in Fulton county. Jeffares said he wasn\u2019t watching Trump\u2019s rally in Atlanta when the ex-president mentioned his name. He heard about it several days later. \u201cIt makes me mad that we\u2019ve been labeled\u201d as election deniers, Jeffares said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even watch it, but when I heard he mentioned our name, you know my first thought was? Damn, we\u2019re in trouble now.\u201d But Jeffares\u2019 concern over Trump\u2019s mentioning of the board\u2019s work didn\u2019t stop him from saying he\u2019d be open to a position in a second Trump administration. In a conversation with the Guardian, Jeffares said he proposed himself as a candidate for a regional director of the Environmental Protection Agency. The proposal came during a conversation with a former Trump campaign adviser, Brian Jack, who is running for a US congressional seat in November. Jeffares, who runs a company that deals with sewage and wastewater projects, helped Jack with his campaign, he said. \u201cI said if y\u2019all can\u2019t figure out who you want to be the EPA director for the south-east, I\u2019d like to have it,\u201d Jeffares said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I said.\u201d With a Democratic ticket marked by surging enthusiasm following the replacement of Biden as candidate with Kamala Harris, Georgia\u2019s status as a swing state has once again become a focal point of both Republican and Democratic campaign strategy. As the state election board continues to implement rules that will affect how Georgia\u2019s elections are run \u2013 and is dominated by pro-Trump Republicans who hold the majority \u2013 the focus on Tindall Ghazal and her work on the board may be about to get a lot bigger. \u201cAll I know is this is where we are, and I am just trying to stop a disaster,\u201d she said. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 August 2024. Sara Tindall Ghazal met her husband in 1998, not 2018 as was originally reported."

            "content": "The New South Wales Liberal party has demanded a week-long extension to lodge nominations for more than 130 council candidates after the party missed the deadline in a \u201cmonumental stuff-up\u201d. But acting NSW electoral commissioner Matthew Phillips considered the grounds for the request and on Saturday rejected an extension. The NSW Liberal party president, Don Harwin, sent a letter to the NSW electoral commission overnight Friday after the party\u2019s head office missed the Wednesday noon deadline to lodge the necessary paperwork to nominate all of its candidates for the local government elections on 14 September. Guardian Australia understands Harwin gave the electoral commission until 4pm on Saturday to respond, and that the letter detailed \u201cissues\u201d with the electoral process. It is understood that the letter also pointed to a section of the Local Government Act outlining that there is discretion around the nomination deadline of the fifth Wednesday before polling day, with the election manager able to determine a different date \u201cin a particular case\u201d. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the party was preparing to take legal action against the electoral commission if this discretion was not used to grant an extension. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In a statement, the NSW Electoral Commission confirmed it had received Harwin\u2019s letter requesting an extension until 21 August. It said the acting commissioner, Dr Matthew Phillips, considered the grounds for the request but determined not to grant an extension. The statement did not provide his reasons for the decision. It comes after the fiasco cost the party\u2019s state director, Richard Shields, his job. In a statement issued after an emergency meeting late on Thursday night, Harwin said the executive had unanimously decided to terminate Shields\u2019 employment. The party is also facing a potential class action from \u201cfurious\u201d candidates over the debacle, with Centennial Lawyers investigating a class action on behalf of the Liberal councillors. Former Waverley mayor and lawyer for the firm, George Newhouse, said he had Liberal party members reach out to him following the incident and was now seeking advice from barristers. Newhouse wouldn\u2019t say how many had reached out, adding members were reluctant to come forward out of fear taking action would impact their careers with the party. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the people that have lost the opportunity to run,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re working on a situation right now where around 150 liberal candidates have been locked out from the election,\u201d he said. The NSW opposition leader, Mark Speakman, on Thursday conceded the \u201cmonumental stuff-up\u201d would damage the Liberals\u2019 brand, including at future state and possibly federal elections. On Friday, the Liberal party issued a statement saying what had occurred was a \u201csetback\u201d and \u201csimply not good enough\u201d, but added that the mistake \u201cwill not define us\u201d."

            "date": "2024-08-13T11:00:13Z",
            "content": "Nearly three dozen officials who have refused to certify elections since 2020 remain in office and will play a role in certifying the presidential vote in nearly every battleground state this fall, according to a new report by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), a watchdog group. The report underscores the concerns that Donald Trump and allies will attack the certification process at the local level as part of any possible effort to contest a loss in the election. In a presidential election, there are tight deadlines at the local, state and federal levels to certify the vote. Delaying the vote at the local level could cause states to miss deadlines and open up protracted court battles and give oxygen to conspiracy theories. Concerns about certification also escalated this month when the state board of election in Georgia passed a new rule that allows local election officials to conduct a \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d if they believe there is a discrepancy in the results. \u201cThe legal ground game that was brought to bear against certifying the election in 2020 was junior varsity compared to what we are going to see this year,\u201d said Joshua Matz, a lawyer on the board of Crew. \u201cThere is now a much better organized, much more sophisticated, far better funded and far more intentional effort to thwart the smooth and steady certification of election results required by the law.\u201d Certification is generally considered a ministerial duty and the officials charged with doing it can\u2019t unilaterally decide not to officialize election results, legal experts say. Ballot disputes and discrepancies are typically adjudicated before an election moves to the certification stage. \u201cEach of these states have procedures for examining potential voter fraud and voter irregularities and none of those procedures concern the certification process at the country level. In other words, there are things you can do. County elections officials denying certification is none of those things. That\u2019s not allowed under the law,\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, the president and CEO of Crew. No effort to block certification thus far has been successful. Each time that local officials have tried, they have been either forced to certify by a court, outvoted by their fellow commissioners or reversed course. Few have faced any consequence, with two notable exceptions. In Arizona, Kris Mayes, the attorney general, criminally charged two supervisors in Cochise county, Tom Crosby and Peggy Judd, after they refused to meet the deadline for certifying the 2022 election. Both Crosby and Judd have pleaded not guilty and are still in office. In 2022, Couy Griffin, a county commissioner in Otero county, New Mexico, also refused to certify the results of a primary election. Griffin was convicted of illegally entering the US Capitol on January 6 and was subsequently removed from his position under the 14th amendment, which bars insurrectionists from holding office in a case filed by Crew. He remains the only elected official to participate in January 6 to be removed from office. Kira Lerner contributed reporting"

            "title": "Can climate stripes change the way we think about air pollution? ",
            "date": "2024-08-23T05:00:27Z",
            "content": "A team of scientists have created a new way to visualise the contrasts in air pollution breathed around the globe. The results show huge inequalities in the quality of air, with the situation worsening in many countries. But the new project also tells a positive story: that focused action by governments can lead to cleaner air. Inspired by Ed Hawkins\u2019 climate stripes, the new air quality stripes show air pollution from 1850 to today. Each year is a separate vertical bar that is coloured according to the amount of particle pollution. Air that meets World Health Organization guidelines is coded as sky blue. Shades of yellows, browns and black represent higher pollution in a colour scheme that reflects more than 200 images of smog from around the world. Dr Kirsty Pringle, of the University of Edinburgh, who co-directed the project, said: \u201cAir pollution is often called the invisible killer but these images make the invisible visible, showing the changes over the decades.\u201d The website allows you to generate your own air pollution stripes for large cities. Dr Jim McQuaid, of the University of Leeds, another co-director of the project, said: \u201cTo me it\u2019s all about that lightbulb moment when someone understands it; that sudden \u2018oh yeah, now I get it\u2019.\u201d The stripes for London and Beijing show the huge improvements that can result when action is taken. For more than a century London was plagued by coal induced smogs so thick that they were likened to pea soup. A reluctant government was finally forced to act when 12,000 people died from a week-long smog in 1952. Clean air acts followed. Coal use was replaced by heating oil and then fossil gas. Beijing\u2019s deteriorating air was largely unnoticed until the eyes of the world turned to the city for the 2008 Olympics. By this time air pollution deaths in China had reached more than 2 million a year, but a recent clean-up of industry and traffic has yielded rapid initial results. Jakarta and Islamabad represent the trajectories of many developing nations with rapid urbanisation and industrial growth and without accompanying air pollution controls. Data for the stripes came from the UK Met Office\u2019s global climate models with adjustments from satellite observations that first became available around 1998. This adjustment was also applied past pollution, projected backwards to 1850 using fuel and energy statistics. On their website, the team responsible observe: \u201cVery few historical observations of PM2.5 exist before the year 2000 so instead we use data produced from a mix of computer model simulations and satellite observations. For the most recent years (2000-2021) we use a dataset that combines ground-level and satellite observations of PM2.5 concentrations from Van Donkelaar et at (2021, V5 0.1 degree resolution), this dataset can be found here.\u201d They added: \u201cModelling global concentrations of pollutants is very challenging, and models are continuously evaluated and improved. Previous research has shown that the CMIP6 multi-model simulations tend to underestimate PM2.5 concentrations when compared to global observations (Turnock et al, 2020). \u201cTo address this issue and to ensure a smooth time series between the model and satellite data, we take the following steps: for each city, we first calculate a three-year (2000-2002) mean of the satellite data for that city. Next, we calculate the three-year (2000-2002) mean of model concentrations for the same city. The ratio between these values represents the model\u2019s bias compared to observations. We then adjust (or \u201cweight\u201d) the model values using this ratio. This is a similar approach to that taken by Turnock et al (2023) and Reddington et al (2023).\u201d Predictions are made for each degree of longitude and latitude. For the UK this is around 60km (40 miles) by 110km (70 miles), so the stripes cannot show the detail of air pollution within each city, but they do illustrate the changes. More than 99% of the world\u2019s population still breathe air that does not meet World Health Organization guidelines. Even after the improvements seen in Europe, particle pollution still leads to more than 400,000 early deaths annually; for the UK it is between 29,000 and 43,000. Prof Ed Hawkins, of the University of Reading, who created the climate stripes, said: \u201cThe climate stripes have appeared on the white cliffs of Dover, on football kits and race cars, at music festivals and at London fashion week. \u201cBy making abstract data tangible, we can all play a part in solving some of the world\u2019s biggest problems. Many major cities worldwide are still struggling with dirty air, but air quality is improving in other places. These are clear demonstrations that critical global issues can be solved with enough political will.\u201d"

A total of 123 elected federal representatives \u2013 100 in the House of Representatives and 23 US senators \u2013 deny the existence of human-caused climate change, all of them Republicans, according to a recent study of statements made by current members. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely concerning,\u201d said Kat So, campaign manager for energy and environment campaigns at the Center for American Progress, who wrote the report.

They said it was going to be a new cooling period,\u201d the Louisiana representative Steve Scalise said in a 2021 interview, referencing long-debunked research that is often still cited by climate deniers. \u201cAnd now it gets warmer and gets colder, and that\u2019s called Mother Nature. But the idea that hurricanes or wildfires were caused just in the last few years is just fallacy.\u201d Climate-denying lawmakers have received a combined $52m in lifetime campaign donations from the fossil fuel industry, the report also found. The research shows that the American public, perhaps uniquely among people in developed countries, is represented disproportionately by climate deniers. Although 23% of the entire US Congress is composed of those who dismiss the climate crisis, polls show the proportion of Americans who share this view is significantly smaller, by as much as half. Even as a quarter of US lawmakers deny the climate crisis, the American public has been moving significantly in the other direction. Fewer than one in five people in the US reject the findings of climate science, according to various studies, with long-running polling by Yale University showing that those they class as \u201cdismissive\u201d stand at just 11%. While this slice of the American public opinion has remained largely unchanged in recent years, a much larger, growing cohort is worried about the climate crisis following a string of record hot years and a parade of wildfires, storms and other climate-fueled events. More than half of Americans are now \u201calarmed\u201d or \u201cconcerned\u201d about climate change, the Yale surveys find. \u201cThe amount of people at each end of the spectrum \u2013 alarmed and dismissive \u2013 were essentially tied back in 2013 but today there are three alarmed people for every one dismissive, so there\u2019s been a fundamental shift in how people see climate change in the US,\u201d said Anthony Leiserowitz, an expert in climate public opinion at Yale. Though the portion of lawmakers who deny the climate crisis is stunning, it has been steadily declining in recent years. Just five years ago, 150 lawmakers denied the crisis. But many elected officials who don\u2019t deny the crisis still use anti-climate rhetoric and work to thwart greenhouse gas curbing policies. The Florida representative Mario Diaz-Balart, for instance, previously used the language of climate denial, but more recently described climate change as being \u201cmore of a religion\u201d \u2013 a different form of \u201cclimate obstruction\u201d, the report says. He has also continued to oppose climate aid. \u201cThere are lots of harmful ways to talk about climate and act on it,\u201d said So. \u201cJust because they accept the scientific findings or say they believe in climate change doesn\u2019t mean that they are not still obstructing climate action, or using rhetoric that is antithetical to climate action.\u201d Naomi Oreskes, a history of science professor at Harvard University who has long studied anti-climate rhetoric, said it was \u201cunsurprising\u201d that the report found old-school climate denial is on the decline. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to deny the science when it\u2019s so much more apparent that the climate is warming, that extreme weather is getting worse and happening constantly,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody can deny the science with a straight face, given everything.\u201d She noted, however, that the fossil fuel industry and its allies have long used a variety of messaging to rebuff concerns about the climate. She said she was unsure those other forms of rhetoric were any less harmful. \u201cAs far back as the 1990s, they were saying renewable energy isn\u2019t reliable enough, or they were saying that wind power \u2026 kills whales,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it really so different from climate denial if you don\u2019t deny the science but you deny the possibility of solutions?\u201d Among ordinary people, Leiserowitz said the views of the relatively small group of people who deny that temperatures are warming, or tie climate science to conspiracy theories involving Al Gore or the United Nations, are often exaggerated both politically and throughout US society. \u201cThis small minority of Americans are really vocal, they are more likely to vote and clearly they are more than adequately represented in the halls of Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are punching above their weight and having an undue influence on the public square, to the extent that most people don\u2019t want to talk about climate change because they think half of the country doesn\u2019t believe in it. There\u2019s a culture of silence \u2013 climate has joined sex, religion and politics as the topics not to bring up at the Thanksgiving table.\u201d Political polarization and the prevalence of \u201csafe\u201d congressional seats, which encourage candidates to hew to more extreme views in order to secure key party primary contests, have helped entrench this imbalance, Leiserowitz said, along with a flood of donations from the fossil fuel industry."

            "date": "2024-08-26T02:41:10Z",
            "content": "The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, will attend a Pacific leaders\u2019 summit this week in Tonga with a focus on climate change in the region, one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable to rising sea levels and temperature changes. The annual meeting of leaders is the top political decision-making body of the region. The week-long summit culminates in the leaders\u2019 retreat, where key decisions are made, which may include an endorsement of a regional policing initiative promoted by Australia. The future for New Caledonia is among other big issues to be addressed at the Pacific Islands Forum (Pif) which began in Tonga on Monday. \u201cWe gather at a pivotal time in our region\u2019s history,\u201d said forum secretary Baron Waqa, a former president of Nauru. \u201cWe are at the centre of global geopolitical interest. We are at the forefront of a battle against climate change.\u201d Australia\u2019s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Christopher Luxon \u2013 leaders of the forum\u2019s two largest economies \u2013 will attend along with most heads of government of the 18-member regional bloc. As geopolitical tensions rise and competition for influence in the Pacific increases, more outside attention has been focused on some of the smallest countries in the world. The threats posed by climate change and sea level rise will be a central part of the summit, which Guterres will address. Pacific leadership will be looking for more financial support for its climate and disaster initiatives. \u201cThe fate of the Pacific depends on limiting the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius,\u201d the UN secretary general said at a press conference in Samoa on Friday, ahead of the meeting in Tonga. \u201cThis region, the Pacific, contributes 0.02% of global emissions. Yet you are on the frontlines of the climate crisis, dealing with extreme weather events from raging tropical cyclones to record ocean heatwaves.\u201d The situation in New Caledonia is also likely to be a focus of the meeting, after the French territory was rattled by deadly violence this year over plans from Paris to expand voting rights. This week, a much anticipated high-level visit to New Caledonia by Pacific leaders was postponed, at the request of Louis Mapou, president of the New Caledonia government. \u201cWe must reach consensus on our vision for a region of peace and security,\u201d Tongan prime minister Siaosi Sovaleni said on Monday. \u201cWe must honour the vision of our forefathers regarding self determination, including in New Caledonia.\u201d The Cook Islands prime minister, Mark Brown, who is the outgoing Pif chair, said at a recent press conference it is challenging for Pif to navigate the impacts of New Caledonia\u2019s dual status as both a full member of the forum and a territory of France. The unrest has seen the territory added as a \u201cstanding item\u201d to the leaders\u2019 agenda which reflects its importance to regional leaders. In recent years the meeting has drawn increasing interest amid a geopolitical battle for influence in the region between the US and China. As Beijing has expanded its influence in the Pacific and increased its economic and security relationships, the US has boosted its engagement on numerous fronts. Washington has promised more aid, struck security partnerships and opened new embassies. Pacific countries have seen a series of ministerial visits from the US and China, as well as new initiatives across different sectors, and a rise in defence diplomacy. Fiji\u2019s prime minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, will travel to the Pif on the heels of a visit to Beijing, where he discussed economic development and other ways to deepen ties. The leaders of Vanuatu and Solomon Islands visited China in July. While Pif members agree on many key priorities, maintaining regional solidarity can be challenging. Last year in Cook Islands, the political divide on deep-sea mining became clear. Since then, Vanuatu has led a charge at the most recent meeting of the International Seabed Authority to prevent licences for exploitation of seabed resources being issued before environmental regulations are in place. Last year, Pacific leaders asked the forum secretariat to convening a regional talanoa (discussion) on this issue. It has yet to take place. Agence-France Presse contributed to this report"

            "date": "2024-08-03T06:00:08Z",
            "content": "A beach in north-east Scotland is eroding rapidly owing to climate change, leaving a town at risk of flooding and its centuries-old golf links crumbling into the sea. The Dynamic Coast report in 2021 studied the rate of erosion at Montrose and predicted that 120 metres would be lost over 40 years, an average of 3 metres a year. People in Montrose are fearing the start of the storm season in autumn, as last year\u2019s record-breaking storms caused the beach to erode 7 metres in the space of a year, more than 4 metres more than scientists predicted. A report on behalf of Montrose Golf Links by EnviroCentre in December revealed that historically observed average rates of retreat are between 2.8\u20137.0 metres a year and that \u201cobserved trends in coastal erosion can be expected to continue, or indeed accelerate in response to future climate change\u201d. Scotland faced unprecedented storms last season and in spring recorded the country\u2019s wettest April since 1947. In November last year, Montrose\u2019s beach promenade collapsed during high tide after Storm Babet, leaving a gaping hole on the walkway. During this storm alone the beach eroded 3 metres. A month later, in December, gales of 86mph were recorded at nearby Inverbervie climate station during Storm Gerrit. David Wood, who leads Montrose community council\u2019s sub-group on coastal erosion at the beach, said: \u201cI\u2019m born and bred in Montrose and I don\u2019t think any of us can remember anything like the level of storms that we had [last season]. Were these once-in-100-year storms? Is it going to be another 100 years? Probably not. This is climate change.\u201d Montrose has a history of coastal erosion that can be measured through the loss of the golf links, founded more than 460 years ago. The original sixth tee disappeared in 1994 and the third tee was moved away from the edge in 2017 but is now also gone. The sea has advanced 70 metres in the past 30 years. Studies by Angus council and Dynamic Coast have shown that urgent maintenance to the receding dunes at Montrose Bay is needed, or there is risk of opening flood corridors through to the town\u2019s residential buildings. \u201cI would give Montrose another three years maximum and I think it\u2019ll be under,\u201d the Montrose independent councillor Tommy Stewart told the Guardian in December. \u201cThe defences will breach if they don\u2019t do anything.\u201d The EnviroCentre report also revealed there could be an estimated 170 metres lost owing to erosion and flooding to the south of Montrose by 2100. The community council is keen for emergency work to go ahead in April 2025, which would involve loading vast quantities of sand on to the beach to build up lost levels. EnviroCentre found that the work to maintain the beach could cost \u00a32m and Angus council is \u00a350m in debt. Wood agreed there were concerns about finances but said Angus council had been working closely with the community council and were building an economic case to send to the Scottish government for the works to start in April. \u201cThe funding will have to come from the Scottish government in some shape or form,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the short-term solution in this sort of beach \u2026 renourishment is not a one-off. You do it once and you may have to do it every year.\u201d Wood said the work proposed for next year was a short- term solution to slow down the erosion process, which would give the council time to build up longer-term solutions to the issue, although how those would be funded is unclear. A spokesperson for Angus council said: \u201cAngus council have identified an outline solution in order to maintain, monitor and measure the erosion at Montrose. We are in regular communication with the Scottish government along with NatureScot, who are leading on a Dynamic Coast project to help tackle coastal erosion in Angus. The cost to progress this project is anticipated to be significant and we are developing a proposal ahead of any bids for funding contributions.\u201d In January, the Scottish government\u2019s secretary for transport, net zero and just transition, M\u00e0iri McAllan, announced that Angus council would receive \u00a3440,000 from the government towards its efforts to combat coastal erosion at Montrose. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe climate emergency is not a distant threat \u2013 we are already seeing an increased impact on coastal communities such as Montrose due to adverse weather and rising sea levels. The Scottish government continues to work with the local community and stakeholders to support them in identifying common ground and building consensus for addressing coastal erosion at Montrose.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-11T09:00:07Z",
            "content": "The chalkhill blue has some surprising claims to fame. For a start, it is one of the UK\u2019s most beautiful butterflies, as can be seen as they flutter above the grasslands of southern England in summer. Then there is their close and unusual relationship with ants. Caterpillars of Lysandra coridon \u2013 found across Europe \u2013 exude a type of honeydew that is milked by ants and provides them with energy. In return, they are given protection in cells below ground especially created for them by the ants. Chalkhill blues thrive as a result, though their numbers are now coming under threat. It is an extraordinary catalogue of features, to which scientists have now made a striking addition thanks to a pioneering new project, known as Psyche, which aims to sequence the genomes of all 11,000 species of butterflies and moths in Europe and reveal in fine detail how climate change and habitat loss are affecting them. As part of Psyche, scientists have found that, depending on location, the cells of the chalkhill blue have different numbers of chromosomes \u2013 the packets of DNA that contain their genetic blueprint. In southern Europe, they have a total of 87 chromosomes, adding them one at a time as they head north until their northern limit is reached, where chalkhill blues have 90 chromosomes. \u201cThat very much goes against the dogma which states that a given species has a given number of chromosomes,\u201d said evolutionary biologist Charlotte Wright of the Wellcome Sanger Institute near Cambridge. \u201cWhy this is changing in the chalkhill blue is intriguing. It is clear that, as it has moved in Europe as glaciers retreated since the end of the last ice age, it has added a chromosome one by one while progressing northwards. It is a surprising observation.\u201d This point was backed by Mark Blaxter, who is also based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. \u201cIf we look back a million years or so, we can tell when two species have split from a single originator. But how does that happen? More to the point, how would we spot what was going on at the time? That is what we are probably seeing here. We are seeing two species in the act of being created from one. We are shining a light on evolution in action.\u201d Project Psyche research is being carried out at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in collaboration with six other leading European research centres including Oulu University, Finland, and the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona. It is named after the Greek goddess of the soul, who was said to have been given butterfly wings by Zeus and was usually depicted by the ancient Greeks wreathed in butterflies. Before the development of modern genomics, the relationship between moths and butterflies generated considerable debate. \u201cHowever, DNA technology has made it clear that butterflies are essentially a sub-group of moths, albeit ones that are generally more colourful,\u201d said Wright. A tenth of all named species on Earth are moths or butterflies and they are uniquely sensitive to changes in habitats, temperature and plants on which they thrive, added Blaxter. \u201cThat means the more we know about them the better informed we will be about the changes affecting the natural world in general. The alterations affecting the chalkhill blue are a perfect example of that knowledge.\u201d Its 87-to-90 complement of chromosomes may seem extreme compared with the 23 pairs possessed by humans. However, large numbers of these genetic packages are common among moths and butterflies, say scientists, with the record being held by another blue butterfly, the species Polyommatus atlanticus. It possesses a staggering set of 229 chromosomes. Another intriguing example of lepidopteran life is provided by the xerces blue butterfly which was recently rendered extinct. By studying samples from museum collections, scientists have determined \u2013 by studying its genomes \u2013 that the species had become highly inbred and vulnerable. \u201cThat research took place in the US but the aim of Psyche is to pinpoint other similarly vulnerable species in Europe in the same way and suggest which are the best targets for interventions to save them,\u201d added Wright. \u201cA genome is a perfect starting point for understanding how well an organism is doing in its environment.\u201d Butterflies and moths are crucial pollinators of plants and are also a key source of foods for birds, so their survival is important, added Wright. \u201cThis is blue-skies research that could have very practical outcomes.\u201d"

            "title": "Biden approves nuclear strategy refocusing on China threat \u2013 report",
            "date": "2024-08-21T14:23:15Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times report on Tuesday. On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat. The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while \u201cthe specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat.\u201d The Times reported that the deterrent policy takes into account a rapid buildup of China\u2019s nuclear arsenal, which will rival the size and diversity of the US and Russian stockpiles over the next decade. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has threatened to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. China\u2019s foreign ministry on Wednesday said that it was \u201cseriously concerned\u201d by the reports and accused the US of \u201cstirring up the so-called \u2018China nuclear threat theory\u2019\u201d. Mao Ning, a foreign ministry spokesperson, said that China had a \u201cno-first-use\u201d policy for nuclear weapons and said that the US was a bigger nuclear threat. According to research by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China had an estimated 500 nuclear warheads in January, up from 410 in January 2023. The US and Russia have more than 5,000 warheads each. But China\u2019s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country\u2019s. The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration\u2019s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from Russia and toward China. Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads \u201cand it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy\u201d. Biden approved the revised strategy \u2013 called the nuclear employment guidance \u2013 in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress. After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia\u2019s nuclear strategies more recently. In February, the US warned allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space. On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, published a piece in Foreign Policy arguing that the US and China could still cooperate on nuclear diplomacy. Zhou said that \u201cit is impossible for Beijing to stand by idly\u201d in the face of deteriorating relations between Russia and the US, but that there was space to strengthen the policies governing the control of nuclear weapons stockpiles. Zhou argued that nuclear-armed states should declare a \u201cno first use\u201d policy, as so far only China and India have done. On Tuesday, the Times reported that two senior administration officials had earlier been permitted to allude to the revision in US nuclear strategy without disclosing its existence. In June, Pranay Vaddi, a senior director of the national security council, warned that \u201cabsent a change\u201d in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal. Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised \u201cthe need to deter Russia, the PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China] and North Korea simultaneously\u201d. The last major nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, New Start, which sets limits on intercontinental-range nuclear weapons, expires in early 2026 with no subsequent agreement in place. China and Russia are now more politically and economically aligned. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea. The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had \u201cissued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries\u201d and for \u201cthe significant increase in the size and diversity\u201d of China\u2019s nuclear arsenal. \u201cIt is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,\u201d the Times quoted Narang as saying. \u201cIt is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.\u201d"

            "title": "Putin\u2019s war is raising risk of another Chernobyl, says historian who inspired hit TV show",
            "date": "2024-08-25T13:00:05Z",
            "content": "There are, Serhii Plokhy says, not many amusing stories to come out of the war between Russia and his native Ukraine. But he couldn\u2019t help but have the bleakest of laughs at one item of news from the last week. It was prompted by a statement from the Russian foreign ministry. Faced with the prospect of Ukrainian forces advancing across the border towards a Russian nuclear power station in Kursk, the ministry called for urgent intervention from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Given Russia\u2019s conduct over the last two years \u2013 shelling and seizing the Ukrainian power station at Zaporizhzhia by force, and for a time occupying the contaminated site at Chernobyl with total disregard for the risks involved, the ironies were too brutal even for him. Plokhy, the celebrated Harvard historian, is the author of the definitive account not only of the genesis of the current war but also of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster (for which he won the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction in 2018, and which was one source for the fabulous HBO drama of the disaster the following year). His new book, Chernobyl Roulette, published with urgent timing next month, is an inside account of how nuclear power facilities have become a terrifying element of the current battlefield. It details, with professorial care, and the intermittent pace of a thriller, exactly what happened after Russian forces entered the Chernobyl exclusion zone in the first week of the invasion in February 2022, trapping more than 100 workers inside the plant for nearly five weeks, until it was liberated by Ukraine. In many ways Plokhy was fated to tell this story. The historian was born in the shadow of Zaporizhzhia, and a few hundred miles downwind of Chernobyl (he was 19 at the time of the disaster). He left Ukraine in 1991 to teach in Canada \u2013 four months that coincided with the failed coup in Moscow that precipitated the final collapse of the Soviet Union and Ukraine\u2019s independence. Much of his writing since then, he told me on an online call last week, with a laugh, has been an attempt to understand \u201cexactly what happened in the four months of my sabbatical\u201d. The current book is the latest instalment of that vocation. You read it with mounting unease, not least because the chaotic events he describes are playing out in real time. On the day that we speak the BBC is leading its bulletins with reports of a major fire at Zaporizhzhia, a reactor complex very similar to the archaic plant at Chernobyl. Plokhy\u2019s book details how up until now the IAEA has been powerless in mitigating these threats \u2013 and makes the argument that \u201cuntil we find out how to protect the existing nuclear power plants, we have no business at all in building new ones.\u201d Counterintuitively he believes that the current threat in Kursk offers a small window of hope. \u201cNow that even Russia is pointing the finger at the IAEA there is maybe an opportunity,\u201d he says, \u201cto look at how basically unprepared we are to deal with a nuclear crisis within a war, when facilities that were envisioned as atoms for peace become atoms for war.\u201d The fact that Russia has invited Rafael Grossi, the head of the IAEA, to visit its Kursk facility next week provides tentative support to this idea (though Grossi\u2019s pre-visit assessment that it \u201cis a Chernobyl-type plant\u201d in which the \u201c[nuclear] fuel elements\u201d are housed \u201cin something like a sports hall\u201d adds to the alarm.) \u201cWhat is coming out of Russia for now is just rhetoric,\u201d Plokhy says. \u201cBut the time may come when it is more than just an attempt to blame somebody else \u2013 and perhaps new protocols can be discussed.\u201d His account of the monumental hubris of the Russian occupation of Chernobyl might serve as Exhibit A in the need for such controls. \u201cThe words that I would use are \u2018extreme recklessness\u2019,\u201d he says of that operation. \u201cA total disregard for human health and human life. And from that point of view, it shows very little has changed since 1986 in terms of Russian [political] culture.\u201d As his original book \u2013 and the primary basis of the TV drama, Svetlana Alexiyevech\u2019s Voices from Chernobyl \u2013 showed that apocalypse was the result not only of antiquated technology but of a command and control system that fatally prioritised party politics over science and health and safety. Plokhy suggests that Putin\u2019s regime has learned nothing from that disaster. \u201cThere is this episode from the current conflict which demonstrates the extent of their recklessness,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile they occupied the site the Russian army began digging trenches, in the exclusion zone at the edge of the Red Forest\u201d. The evidence suggests that conscripted troops, without any protective clothing or equipment, blithely excavated some of the most toxic radioactive land on earth. The other pivotal scene in the current book involves the extraordinary moment when the commanders of Russian forces entered the operations room of the Chernobyl plant. Their plan was to take into custody the safety experts and scientists who monitored the plant, without any apparent contingency for what came next. Plokhy describes how the power balance in that room quickly shifted as the people in charge of the plant coolly observed that if they handed over control, they also handed over the enormous responsibility and risks of keeping Chernobyl safe. \u201cThat scene was amazing,\u201d Plokhy says. \u201cMy surprise on revisiting Chernobyl after 1986 was not only to see how much Russia hadn\u2019t changed in its approach. But also to see how much Ukraine had departed from that culture of 1986. The people in charge of the site put their faith in the regulations and protocols. They believed they would be traitors if they abandoned the station.\u201d The scene, I suggest, would make a fitting sequel to the televised Chernobyl drama. Plokhy agrees. \u201cThe 1986 story was of the catastrophe, and catastrophes normally attract more attention. Catastrophe did not happen this time. Instead though, it\u2019s a phenomenal story, if you like, of the kidnapped kidnapping the kidnappers.\u201d The Russian army came and took hostages, and hostages immediately turned their expertise back against them. In order to tell that story, Plokhy was given access to the testimonies of those involved on the Ukrainian side, collected after liberation. \u201cChernobyl obviously has a special importance and meaning worldwide, and particularly in Ukraine,\u201d he says, \u201cso there were a lot of people who immediately went into the zone to collect this information. I was really very lucky that what is called the reckoning project allowed me to use those materials. My task was really to make sense out of it all.\u201d Obviously, he had a personal stake in all this; how easy was it for him to be objective? \u201cWell, I made the decision that while writing the last book, The Russo-Ukrainian War, that I had a mission, to tell the story of those people.\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I know that to be effective in this mission, I had to push aside emotions, or not allow them to dominate. I tried wherever I could to use Russian sources, but inevitably most came from the Ukrainian side. Still, in the back of my mind, constantly, I was thinking: \u2018OK, be careful in what you say. You don\u2019t have all the sources.\u2019\u201d Plokhy had family in Zaporizhzhia when the war started. His previous book was dedicated and paid tribute to his cousin, who was killed in fighting near Bakhmut in October 2022. Are other family members still there? \u201cMy sister was in Zaporizhzhia for a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to leave and we were trying to persuade her, and eventually we managed to do that. Fortunately when the Russians took over the nuclear power plant, she was already on the way out.\u201d Is he getting information from on the ground now? \u201cPeople there have to be very careful,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re have been many [Russian] arrests of people reporting information to their families. So, no, I don\u2019t have that access. For example, like everyone, I read what Russians and Ukrainians are saying about this latest fire in Zaporizhzhia. I basically think that Ukrainians are probably telling the story that is closer to the truth: that because of what is happening in Kursk, the Russians were interested in staging something and [creating alarm by] burning tyres there. But I don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d That high-stakes standoff makes the case for his wider point that the world isn\u2019t paying enough attention to the scale of the nuclear threat. Does he feel like a Cassandra \u2013 drawing attention to imminent disaster, but with nobody properly listening? \u201cYes, I have this feeling,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I understand that there are good reasons for people to look the other way. One of them was also produced by the war, after sanctions on Russian oil and gas. \u201cSome people want to see nuclear energy as the saviour, not only in the long term because of climate change, but also in the short term, economically. Despite what is happening, the last two years have seen the most positive stories about nuclear energy since before the Fukushima disaster [in 2011].\u201d War is not the only thing which is highlighting the threats to greater international co-operation on nuclear safety. Obviously Plokhy is watching these events unfold in an American election year. A second Trump presidency would no doubt jeopardise Ukraine\u2019s independent future as well as further undermining UN authority. How does he view that prospect? \u201cIt won\u2019t surprise you,\u201d he says, \u201cthat I look at that with horror not just [at Trump] but more about how his sort of political behaviour can be embraced by so many of my now compatriots.\u201d And what of the other major variable in the horrific conflict. Does he sense that Putin\u2019s internal power is waning at all? \u201cKursk is a massive challenge to his narrative,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is still certainly fear of Putin in the west. But historically there was less fear in Ukraine, and still is.\u201d One way of looking at the war, he says, is \u201cPutin marching from one failure to another\u201d. That fact brings with it other threats. \u201cWe should remember Churchill\u2019s cold war speech about the balance of terror,\u201d Plokhy insists. \u201cIt was that fear [of mutual destruction] that helped the world to avoid cataclysm during the cold war. But I would say the balance of terror is now of a more complicated nature. That unpredictability is what makes this time so dangerous.\u201d Despite everything, however, he is not without hope that a new consensus can be formed. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d Plokhy says, \u201c[nuclear power] is the place where we can start creating that consensus. Perhaps the lesson of 2022 is that this is the moment that should be seized on to talk about the security of the nuclear sites and then build on that for the future.\u201d If that is the case, then his book would be a good place for those discussions to start."

            "content": "Police are investigating an alleged death threat sent to Amanda Abbington, demanding the actor withdraw her complaint about the dancer Giovanni Pernice. In recent weeks Abbington has spoken out about her experience on the last series of Strictly Come Dancing, where she was paired with the Italian before quitting in week five of the competition. According to the Sun, the Sherlock star was sent an email warning her she would \u201cdie on stage\u201d unless she retracted her complaint about Pernice, who left the show before the upcoming season. Citing \u201cmedical\u201d and \u201cpersonal\u201d reasons at the time, the actor went on to make a complaint about the teaching methods of her former dance partner, alleging she was subjected to \u201cinappropriate, mean, nasty bullying\u201d while on the show. Abbington told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour that while there were \u201cpockets of times\u201d when she got along with Pernice, an ultimately tumultuous relationship prompted her to raise the alarm. \u201cI decided to just speak to the producers about it and say: \u2018Look, I\u2019m not comfortable. This is beginning to slightly get out of hand. And it\u2019s a repeat pattern, it starts well, and then it starts to descend into chaos\u2019.\u201d She also spoke about receiving extreme online abuse after making the complaint against Pernice. This abuse, which included death and rape threats, made her fearful of using public transport. Abbington is now starring in When It Happens to You at the Park theatre in Finsbury Park, north London, and police said they were called to a theatre in the area on Friday afternoon. A statement from the Metropolitan police to PA Media said: \u201cPolice were called at around 4pm on Friday August 2 by a staff member at a theatre in Finsbury Park following receipt of an alleged malicious communication. \u201cThere have been no arrests, inquiries are ongoing.\u201d Abbington is the not the only former partner of Pernice who has made allegations about his behaviour. Laura Whitmore, who took part in the 2016 series, said she felt \u201cextremely uncomfortable with him\u201d and \u201ccried every day\u201d. And Ranvir Singh said of her experience in 2020: \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by his angelic face. He\u2019s a fiery Italian, super-strict. I\u2019m a bit scared of him.\u201d The 33-year-old Sicilian has rejected \u201cany suggestion of abusive or threatening behaviour\u201d, and believes he will be cleared by a BBC review.

            "date": "2024-08-19T04:00:50Z",
            "content": "A vulnerable unpaid carer threatened by benefits officials with prosecution for fraud unless she agreed to pay a \u00a31,300 penalty for an accidental breach of carer\u2019s allowance earnings rules has described her experience as \u201clike blackmail\u201d. Clemency Jacques, a carer for her disabled son, was told by Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) investigators her case would be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) unless she paid a 50% charge on top of an existing agreement to repay \u00a32,600 in carer\u2019s allowance overpayments \u2013 a total of \u00a33,900. Jacques, 43, a former NHS psychologist who cares for her severely disabled son and frail elderly mother, said she was threatened with prosecution even though the DWP accepted she had made an \u201cunintentional error\u201d. Her treatment was condemned as a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and \u201cinhumane\u201d by politicians and campaigners amid growing concern over the DWP\u2019s policy of prosecuting \u2013 or threatening with prosecution \u2013 carers who unwittingly breach carer\u2019s allowance benefit earnings rules by relatively minor amounts. \u201cAgreeing to the administrative penalty feels more like blackmail than an actual choice. It\u2019s like: \u2018Say how naughty you have been and pay us a large chunk of money or we will send you to court and punish you for being a stressed-out carer,\u2019\u201d Jacques said. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, who is a carer for his disabled teenage son, said: \u201cThe fact the government is forcing carers to chose between an expensive fine or a criminal record, just for making an innocent mistake, is a disgrace. \u201cThis is all part of the legacy left to Labour by the Conservative party, who failed carers again and again and treated them like criminals.\u201d The DWP said it was reviewing Jacques\u2019s case \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d. The government last month promised a wider review of carer\u2019s allowance following a Guardian investigation that revealed that tens of thousands of unpaid carers were repaying more than \u00a3250m in overpayments that in many cases had been allowed to accumulate because of years of DWP administrative failures. Carer\u2019s allowance, worth \u00a381.90 a week, is claimed by just under a million unpaid carers in the UK who look after disabled, frail and ill loved ones for at least 35 hours a week. Most are women and a high proportion are in poverty. Jacques\u2019s case was taken up earlier this year by her then MP, Caroline Lucas, who asked the DWP to review its decision. Lucas described Jacques\u2019s treatment by officials as \u201cdisproportionate and inhumane\u201d and argued they had failed to take into account \u201cthe exceptional and extenuating circumstances\u201d of her situation. Jacques, a single mother, said at the time of the overpayments she was overwhelmed by looking after her severely disabled toddler son, Alex, who had been born prematurely and needed constant care, while also caring for her mother who had Alzheimer\u2019s. Jacques herself had post-traumatic stress related to birth complications and was attempting to move back into work after maternity leave. Responding to Lucas in May, the DWP complaints team stood by its decision, saying it had followed the correct processes and taken \u201creasonable, necessary and proportionate\u201d actions. It said it was not its intention \u201cto cause claimants any undue distress\u201d but had a \u201cresponsibility to protect public funds and preserve public trust\u201d. Jacques told the Guardian she had been \u201cpetrified\u201d by the DWP\u2019s treatment of her for what she said was an unwitting oversight made during a period when she was under extreme stress. \u201cWhat is most frustrating is that I didn\u2019t claim fraudulently. I was most definitely a carer twice over. I didn\u2019t fake or overstate my situation,\u201d she said. Under carer\u2019s allowance earnings rules, claimants must pay back the entire \u00a381.90 a week benefit if they earn more than the \u00a3151 a week earnings limit, even by a penny. These have been criticised as \u201cperverse\u201d, plunging carers into financial hardship and ill health after they unwittingly ran up huge overpayments. In Jacques\u2019s case, the DWP would have been alerted immediately by HMRC that she had returned to paid work and was earning above the limit, but it did not act, allowing her overpayments to build to a size where prosecution for fraud became a possibility. The Guardian can reveal the DWP has levied more than \u00a35m in additional fines on thousands of carers in the past four years relating to earnings rule breaches, on top of clawing back at least \u00a3250m in carer\u2019s allowance overpayments. These comprise \u00a3420,000 from administrative penalties such as the one paid by Jacques \u2013 225 claimants have paid these since 2020 to prevent their case from being passed to the CPS \u2013 and \u00a34.8m in more routine civil penalties of \u00a350, levied on at least 98,000 carers deemed to have breached earnings rules over the same four-year period. Dominic Carter, the director of policy at Carers Trust, said: \u201cSadly, we have heard of plenty of examples like this. It\u2019s frustrating that so many carers continue to fall foul of a system not fit for the present day. Carers shouldn\u2019t be made to feel like criminals, they should be recognised for the contribution they make to society and to the taxpayer.\u201d Katy Styles, the founder of We Care Campaign, a grassroots network for unpaid carers, said: \u201cThreatening to criminalise unpaid carers over genuine and understandable errors related to carer\u2019s allowance earnings rules is a disproportionate response, and it\u2019s shocking that we continue to hear these stories. Where is the compassion?\u201d Official data shows that 119 carer\u2019s allowance cases have gone to court in the last two years after being referred to the CPS by the DWP. A trawl through local newspaper reports and court data suggests scores of unpaid carers have criminal records after being prosecuted for inadvertent earnings-related breaches."

Although scientists knew that pollution and warmer water damage life in freshwater they had not realised the combination of the two further hastens the destruction of much aquatic life, especially the diversity of small creatures which fish need for food. Humans, as happened at the Olympic Games, can choose to avoid endangering themselves by not entering polluted water, but fish in the River Seine in Paris have no options. They are gradually being wiped out by the combination of warmer water and pollution. In Britain the privatised water companies and poorly controlled industrial farming companies have been increasingly pouring raw sewage, animal waste and fertilisers into our waterways for decades. There is a public outcry over this and the new government has promised to take action to improve matters but the new research makes clear that the problem is even more severe and urgent than previously thought. Cherished trout and salmon fisheries and the already endangered eel populations require rivers to be clean and cool for their entire length for adults to breed. Many long-established coarse fisheries will also be lost."

            "date": "2024-08-13T15:37:44Z",
            "content": "The UK jobs market bucked predictions of a further weakening in June after official figures showed unemployment fell and wages stayed well above inflation, sending the value of the pound higher. Unemployment unexpectedly dropped to 4.2% from 4.4% in the three months to June from the previous three months, according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released on Tuesday. Wage growth, excluding bonuses, was 5.4% year on year over the three months to June, slipping from 5.7% in the previous three months. The drop represented the smallest increase since July 2022, when it was 5.2%, but was well above the 4.6% increase that City economists had expected. Adjusted for inflation, wages rose by 1.6%, meaning many workers will experience a continued improvement in their standard of living. Vacancies also fell, giving a further indication that the jobs market is returning closer to pre-pandemic levels of activity. Analysts were divided about how the figures would influence the Bank of England\u2019s decision on interest rates when policymakers meet next month. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said wages growth, despite a fall, could push inflation higher, forcing the central bank to maintain interest rates at a high level for a longer period. \u201cThe persistence of strong wage growth raises concerns about stickier inflation, which may prompt the Bank of England to remain cautious about further interest rate cuts,\u201d it said. Capital Economics, a consultancy, said the downward path of wages growth was enough to keep the Bank on track to make two further quarter-point cuts in interest rates this year from 5% to 4.5%. Currency traders reacted positively to the figures and the pound gained more than half a cent against the dollar, or 0.43%, on Tuesday to reach $1.2809, the highest since 5 August. Sandra Horsfield, a senior financial markets analyst at Investec, said traders had reacted to the small drop in wages growth, a 51,000 drop in unemployment and an increase in employment of 97,000 over the previous quarter as signs that the economy remained robust and the next cut in interest rates would come much later in the year. \u201cAll things considered, we think the [Bank] will take its time to see a weakening pay trend confirmed in later releases and only agree on a next rate cut in November,\u201d she said. Growth in total pay including bonuses fell from 5.7% to a much lower level of 4.5%, after business surveys showed employers in many sectors were proving reluctant to hire staff. However, the data is distorted by one-off bonus payments made to NHS staff in June 2023. Inactivity remained high at 9.41 million, or 22.2% of the working-age population \u2013 up 350,000 from 2023 \u2013 as people reported they were unable to work because of ill health. Julia Turney, a partner at the consultancy Barnett Waddingham, said: \u201cThe workforce we are dealing with today is older, increasingly remote and more in touch with mental health challenges than ever before. \u201cIn fact, earlier this year Mental Health UK found that in the past year, one in nine UK adults had experienced high levels of stress that contributed to them also taking time off work during that period.\u201d The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is under pressure to increase funding for mental health services to help people back into work when she delivers her budget later this year. She said: \u201cToday\u2019s figures show there is more to do in supporting people into employment because if you can work, you should work. \u201cThis will be part of my budget later in the year where I will be making difficult decisions on spending, welfare and tax to fix the foundations of our economy so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of our country better off.\u201d Reeves will deliver her first budget on 30 October. Wages growth in the finance and business services industry outpaced other sectors with an annual improvement of 6.2%. The ONS said: \u201cThe construction sector saw the smallest annual regular pay growth across sectors, at 3.5%. In April to June 2024, the manufacturing sector saw the largest increase in pay, including bonuses at 6.7%.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-28T22:23:28Z",
            "content": "Next week\u2019s March quarter GDP figures will once again put the spotlight on the weakness of the economy. But questions about a recession are already with us and the answer is rather complex. Australia\u2019s economy grew just 0.1% in the last quarter of 2023. That is, to be blunt, not a lot. Given that each quarter the growth figures are revised slightly, there is a small worry that next week we could find the December quarter revised to go backwards. If the March quarter then fell, that would mean hello, recession! Population: us! The good news is that this is unlikely. The quarterly growth figures do change but usually they go up, not down: If the graph does not display click here So that\u2019s the good news: unless something out of the ordinary occurs, we are not likely to get a shock recession announcement next week. But is a recession coming? Last week Deloitte dropped a large cat among the pigeons when it suggested that the lack of hiring among companies was consistent with a rise in unemployment that would put us into recession territory. None of this is surprising. In July I reported how businesses were much less likely to hire than they were six and 12 months ago, and back in March I noted how the rise in unemployment was putting us closer to recession territory. All the talk in the past week or so about recessions has not actually been about GDP going backwards but the rise in unemployment triggering the \u201cSahm rule\u201d of recessions. I\u2019ve been talking about this rule for some time now \u2013 I first mentioned it in 2020 \u2013 but it has taken a while for it to become part of the mainstream commentary. Essentially the rule looks at changes in the unemployment rate rather than GDP to determine recessions. Claudia Sahm, the economist who created the rule, argues essentially that when unemployment rises half a per cent in a year that has historically meant a recession is coming. The problem for Australia is the July unemployment rate means that right now the Sahm rule for Australia is 0.49% points: If the graph does not display click here So is that it? Are we headed for a recession? Well, no. Firstly, the whole point of the Sahm rule is to prevent a recession. Sahm devised this rule to get governments and central banks to act earlier rather than wait for GDP to go backwards. One other reason for optimism is that, while unemployment is rising, for the most part this is due to youth unemployment: If the graph does not display click here This is not to discount the impact on younger workers but younger workers are always the first to be laid off because they generally have the least experience and skills. While that can be a sign that things are about to get worse (younger workers can be the canary in the recession coalmine), true recessions have unemployment rising for all workers. When we break down the Sahm rule by youth workers and \u201cprime-aged\u201d workers between 25 and 64, it is clear that younger workers would feel as though they are in a recession but not so much everyone else: If the graph does not display click here That is not to say we can put up our feet and stop worrying. The last time (excluding the pandemic) when the unemployment of 25- to 64-year-olds was rising this fast was at the end of 2014. In response the RBA (perhaps belatedly) cut interest rates twice in the first half of 2015. But the other reason to perhaps not to ring the recession alarm is that, while unemployment is rising, employment growth is holding up pretty well. If the graph does not display click here Both full-time and total employment for workers aged 25 to 64 is growing about 3% over the past year. That is not what you see during a recession. So all good? Stop worrying and enjoy the recession-free economy? Well, not quite. While employment is holding up well, hours worked is not \u2013 and hours worked is in some ways a sharper indicator of how the economy is going than just counting jobs. The hours worked by women aged 25 to 64 rose strongly after the pandemic \u2013 mostly off the back of a surge in healthcare and social assistance work within the care sector. Now it has hit a bit of a plateau. So not great, but OK. But the average hours worked by men aged 25 to 64 is falling, and that is not good at all: If the graph does not display click here The average hours worked by prime working age men always falls during a recession and things at the moment suggest at the very least that it\u2019s as tough now to get hours as it was before the pandemic. And, just in case you need reminding, back then economists were coming up with policies for the government to avoid a recession. So, no, we are not in a recession and next week we are unlikely to discover any different. And, while we might be able to dismiss most of the rise in unemployment as among the youth, not everything is sweet and joyful. The weak overall economic growth and poor increase in hours worked suggests the Reserve Bank will continue to look for a chance to cut interest rates without fear of driving inflation. And the government will feel it made the right call delivering the stage-three tax cuts and energy rebates to help boost household spending so that the economy does not slow to the point that talk about whether we are in a recession becomes much easier to answer.

            "content": "Australia\u2019s unemployment rate ticked higher last month, even as employers added about three times as many jobs as expected. The job gains will probably discourage the Reserve Bank from cutting its key interest rate in the near term. The jobless rate in July rose to 4.2%, seasonally adjusted, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on Thursday. Economists had expected the rate to remain in line with June\u2019s 4.1% level for June. The economy added 58,200 jobs last month, with 60,500 full-time roles added and 2,300 part-time jobs shed. Economists had tipped employers would have added a net 20,000 positions. The 4.2% jobless rate was the highest since January 2022. Still, March aside, the economy had added jobs every month this year, with the monthly average topping 40,000. The participation rate, which gauges the share of the working age population in the workforce, clicked higher to a record 67.1%. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cAlthough the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage point in each of the past two months, the record high participation rate and near record high employment-to-population ratio shows that there continues to be a high number of people in jobs, and looking for and finding jobs,\u201d the ABS head of labour statistics, Kate Lamb, said. \u201cWhile unemployment increased to 637,000 people in July, the highest it has been since November 2021, it remains around 70,000 people below its pre-pandemic level,\u201d she said, adding the data \u201csuggests the labour market remains quite tight\u201d. The number of hours worked nudged o.4% higher, to 1.961bn, the ABS said. The labour market figures would be closely watched by the central bank as it considered whether inflation could remain on a downward track towards its 2%-3% goal while retaining as many job gains as possible. The RBA expected the jobless rate to rise to 4.3% by December, a level that it would consider to be close to full employment. Prior to the release of today\u2019s labour market figures, investors were rating the chance of an RBA rate cut of 25 basis points to 4.1% when its board next meets on 23-24 September as a 50-50 chance. Markets were also fully pricing in the odds of such a cut by the bank\u2019s final meeting of the year in December, according to the ASX rates tracker. The Australian dollar gained about a quarter of a US cent to 66.05 US cents on the news. Stocks, though, erased most of their gains for the day as investors pared their expectations an RBA interest rate cut might be just around the corner. David Bassanese, the chief economist for BetaShares, said the labour figures were consistent with the RBA \u201cremaining firmly on hold \u2013 most likely for the remainder of this year at least\u201d. \u201cThe combination of still solid employment growth yet rising unemployment points to the ongoing strong growth in labour supply \u2013 due to both still solid immigration and rising labour force participation,\u201d Bassanese said. \u201cThe good news for the economy, at least, is that the RBA\u2019s desired rise in the unemployment rate is not coming via sharp reductions in employment, but rather strong growth in labour supply relative to softer \u2013 but still firmly growing \u2013 labour demand.\u201d Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist with Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the jobs market was likely to cool but \u201cwill not buckle\u201d in coming months. \u201cIn seasonally adjusted terms, wage growth has eased in each of the last three quarters, taking six-month annualised growth from a peak of 4.7% in the final three months of 2023 to just 3.4% in the June quarter this year,\u201d Murphy Cruise said. \u201cOn top of that, job vacancies fell 3.7% month-on-month in July to be at their lowest point since August 2021 and survey measures show the proportion of employers looking to expand their workforce is at its lowest since late 2020,\u201d he said."

Israeli soldiers at a nearby checkpoint fired live bullets at teenagers and young men throwing stones in an altercation a few weeks ago, said the factory\u2019s owner, Sami al-Nader. Hebron, a city in the south of the occupied West Bank, is far from the fighting between Hamas and Israel that has raged in the Gaza Strip for 10 months. But violence between Palestinians and the Israeli army and settlers in the West Bank has also reached a level not seen for 20 years, and new restrictions such as road closures, lockdowns and the cancellation of thousands of Israel work permits are suffocating the economy and daily life. \u201cThe pandemic does not compare to what our business is going through now. We used to welcome tourists every day, and now, if we are lucky, we sell things on Saturdays only. We are not even getting online orders, because no one in Palestine has any money,\u201d said Nader, 47. \u201cMy family has owned the factory for more than 70 years. I do not want it to close under my watch.\u201d For better or worse, the Israeli and Palestinian economies are deeply intertwined: Israel relies on cheaper Palestinian labour, particularly in construction and agriculture, and before the war higher Israeli wages generated an estimated 20% of the Palestinian Authority\u2019s (PA) GDP. In 2022, these workers contributed \u00a33.05bn to the Palestinian economy, two-thirds of the PA\u2019s total budget. After the Hamas attacks of 7 October, however, Israel suspended entry for about 140,000 Palestinian workers from the West Bank. Only a fraction of those have since been restored, and Israel is trying to plug the gap with labourers from India. As a result, unemployment and poverty in the West Bank have soared, putting the already unstable territory on the brink of a financial crash and fuelling unrest. In the West Bank\u2019s refugee camps, set up after the creation of Israel in 1948 and even today still slum-like, young men told the Guardian that militant groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were the only employers they could find. Unemployment in the first quarter of 2024 was up 11% to 35% year on year, according to the International Labour Organization, and the UN estimates a 13- to 16-year setback in human development. Inflation is up, the PA has slashed salaries and cut workers, and Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, is withholding tax funds to the PA as a punitive measure for its cooperation with the international criminal court in The Hague. He has also repeatedly threatened to cut off Palestinian banks from the international banking system, which would cause the PA to collapse altogether. \u201cAll Israeli administrations use the stick and the carrot with the PA, but the current government is pursuing particularly contradictory policies. Israel needs the PA to maintain security in the West Bank and protect settlers but they are leveraging what they can,\u201d said Tahani Mustafa, a senior Palestine analyst at the Crisis Group thinktank. \u201cThe other logic is that of collective punishment: although it\u2019s not worked in the past they seem to still believe that if you impose an economic siege, and a siege on movement, and squeeze the people enough, they will obey.\u201d In Nahalin, a Palestinian village south of Jerusalem, father and son Mahmood and Yaqoub Dadouh, both skilled marble and stone workers, now spend most of their days doing projects in the garden. The lights are off in Mahmood\u2019s huge kitchen and bathroom materials warehouse next door; he used to mainly supply Israelis from the nearby settlement of Beitar Illit, but not a single customer has come for the better part of a year. Yaqoub, a father of two small girls, said he was still owed 16,000 shekels (\u00a33,300) from a project in Israel that was cancelled after 7 October. The contractor is refusing to take his calls. \u201cWe\u2019ve already sold all of the gold, the jewellery. It was heartbreaking asking my wife to do that,\u201d said Yaqoub, 29. \u201cI think we can manage with our savings for another two months. After that I have no idea what we are going to do.\u201d There is no reliable data, but in the past few years people in the West Bank have begun finding ways to get through Israel\u2019s various security barriers into Israel without permits, in search of better-paid work. It is a dangerous decision, but an estimated 40,000 Palestinians are still making the journey, sometimes staying in Israel undocumented for weeks at a time. A cousin of the Dadouhs found work on a construction site in southern Israel a few weeks ago, the pair said. He has no insurance or rights and risks being caught, but is at least able to send money to his family. \u201cI think the situation is not sustainable,\u201d Yacoub said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want us any more \u2013 then end the occupation and let us work for ourselves.\u201d"

            "content": "Britain\u2019s labour market is cooling, with annual earnings growth easing markedly and the number of job vacancies falling for a 25th month in a row. Or is it? The number of people in work climbed by almost 100,000 in the three months to June while the jobless rate fell from 4.4% to 4.2%. The picture is confusing, to say the least, but look closely at the latest bulletin from the Office for National Statistics and some themes stand out. One is that there is no evidence of a wage-price spiral. Annual growth in total earnings \u2013 regular pay plus bonuses \u2013 was 4.3% in the three months to June. That is down from 5.7% in the three months to May and half the 8.6% recorded in June 2023. Part of that decrease was due to last year\u2019s high NHS bonus payments not being repeated, but there was still a fall in annual earnings growth \u2013 from 5.8% to 5.4% \u2013 once the impact of bonuses is stripped out. Pay deals seem to be responding to the fall in inflation back to the Bank of England\u2019s official 2% target in May and June. A second theme is that employers are starting to hire again as the economy emerges from its soft patch in the second half of last year. Trends in unemployment tend to lag behind what is happening to economic activity \u2013 but the recession of late 2023 was short-lived and growth has bounced back. Despite what Rachel Reeves might say about being the chancellor with the worst inheritance since the second world war, the labour market figures suggest Jeremy Hunt bequeathed an economy that was on the mend and \u2013 by recent standards \u2013 in reasonable shape. Unemployment is down and employment is up. That said, firms are still showing a degree of caution. The number of part-time workers rose by 144,000 in the three months to June, while the number of full-time workers fell by 48,000. Thirdly, while the overall picture looks relatively benign, deep structural problems remain. More than 2.8 million people are economically inactive because of long-term ill-health, while the labour market has become more dependent on workers born outside the UK. The number of UK-born workers in employment has fallen by 316,000 in the past year, while the number born in other countries has risen by 249,000. The curate\u2019s egg nature of the latest ONS figures \u2013 good in parts \u2013 means they are not much help for the Bank\u2019s interest-rate setters as they contemplate what to do with borrowing costs. They do, however, highlight some important issues that government ministers \u2013 Reeves, and the work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, in particular \u2013 need to address."

            "content": "Never mind the buzz around Katarina Johnson-Thompson in the heptathlon or Noah Lyles\u2019s Covid bronze. Another battle is being waged in Paris among the TikTok-obsessed and it\u2019s all about which hand gesture is going to win summer. Will it be the peace sign, as shown by the rapper Snoop Dogg while carrying the Olympic torch to the opening ceremony? Or will it be the \u201chand heart\u201d, so sweetly semaphored by the US gymnast Simone Biles to her husband, Jonathan Owens, last week? If the key to victory is frequency, the hand heart has it, thanks to plenty of other Olympic sightings, from the French steeplechaser Alice Finot who followed her pre-race heart to her \u201cAl-eece! Al-eece!\u201d-chanting home crowd with a new European record and a marriage proposal to her amour, to Team GB\u2019s skateboarding medallist Sky Brown, table-tennis players, canoeists, footballers and rugby players. Add to that virtually all celebrities, including Taylor Swift, who in 2011 claimed to have invented it: \u201cIt means something between \u2018I love you\u2019 and \u2018thank you\u2019,\u201d she said at the time. It\u2019s a useful gesture. \u201cThe hand heart is an effective way for athletes to show their affection to their fans and connect with them,\u201d said the Australian linguist and podcaster Lauren Gawne. She was not convinced Swift pioneered the gesture. She admitted: \u201cTracing [the origin] is often very difficult. But Taylor certainly popularised it to this level of visibility.\u201d Before you cup your hands together to have a go, the battle gets a bit more complex because gen Z and gen Alpha \u2013 all those aged under 27 \u2013 argue that millennials have got the hand heart all wrong. The way to do it, apparently, is not to have all fingers touching, but by contorting just the index and middle digits together into a heart shape. \u201cThis is the only heart that makes physical and logical sense,\u201d says one TikToker in the video \u201cMillennial Vs Gen Z Heart Sign\u201d. \u201cYou cannot convince me that this nonsense [the millennial heart] is better than this.\u201d Another, captioned \u201cGuess the millennial\u201d, shows a Zoomer (a very gen Z way of saying gen Z) doing their version with her cafe co-workers until she encounters a millennial colleague, who \u2013 gasp \u2013 offers a thumb instead. Rumbled, grandma! The gen Z version is smart because it requires youthful dexterity \u2013 you only need to Google \u201cBenedict Cumberbatch trying to do finger heart\u201d to appreciate how hard it is for grownups to coax fingers into place on demand. \u201cGen Z and gen A are no different to when we were kids,\u201d said Rachel Richardson of the newsletter Highly Flammable. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be like our parents. We thought everything our parents did was deeply uncool \u2013 they\u2019re reinventing ways to distinguish themselves.\u201d So, yes, it\u2019s warfare, but, she added, \u201cin the way you\u2019d laugh at your dad for getting a cool new pair of trainers\u201d. Indeed, the desire for young people to put distance between them and their elders has produced a steady stream of hand gestures such as \u201cfinger hearts\u201d, \u201ccheek hearts\u201d and even \u201cbiting hearts\u201d. \u201cThe thing about hand gestures is that they are wonderfully ephemeral,\u201d said Gawne. \u201cThere\u2019s the combination of different cultures and generations, plus social media, so things can just shoot off in different directions. It makes for a really interesting space.\u201d And what about the peace sign? Despite plenty of appearances in Paris, via the double-medal-winning Indian shooter Manu Bhaker, the judokas Hifumi Abe of Japan and the Palestinian Fares Badawi, and, of course, Snoop, Zoomers view it as \u201ccringe\u201d, according to Richardson, because it is \u201cassociated with their parents and the Spice Girls\u201d. But what do Zoomers know? Wikipedia lists 17 different political and social connotations for the V sign, from Argentina to Iran to the Philippines \u2013 and that\u2019s not including the \u201cup yours\u201d version or its original intention, an emblem for allied victory in the second world war. Its modern cultural heartland is east Asia, where it isn\u2019t just a photographic pose that signifies camera-readiness (hailing, apparently, from a moment of spontaneity during a Konica TV ad shoot in 1970s Japan), but, said Fiona Harkin, a director at the foresight consultancy The Future Laboratory, \u201cIt\u2019s also about happiness and fun \u2013 it\u2019s the culture of cute and kawaii.\u201d So peace and joy versus love and gratitude \u2013 which gesture wins out? And who decides? \u201cFor sure, it\u2019s gen Z,\u201d said Harkin. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones that care about that codification. We have to have our codes to flex against the previous generation. And thank goodness for that \u2013 that\u2019s how we get the friction that creates change.\u201d Time to limber up those fingers?"

            "date": "2024-08-22T06:30:29Z",
            "content": "Why the plural? There\u2019s only one Munich in David Peace\u2019s new novel, and we see very little of it: the slushy runway where British European Airways flight 609 crashes on February 6, 1958; the hotel room where two survivors spend their first bewildered night; the hospital where their fellow passengers recover \u2013 or don\u2019t. This is surely the story of one accident, one time, one team: the air crash that killed 23 out of 44 passengers, including eight of Manchester United\u2019s players, three of its staff, and eight journalists. But Peace\u2019s reasoning becomes clear over the several hundred pages of this relentless, electrifying, harrowing novel. The Munich Air Disaster, so integral a part of how the football club developed, and which had such a profound impact on the city, the north of England, the sporting community and the country as a whole, might easily not have happened had takeoff been aborted. And what would the world look like then? Like much of Peace\u2019s work, Munichs is an obsessional study in hauntology; not merely the idea that the past lives with us, but that multiple futures do, too. In extremis, time may seem to stop, but in reality, it judders on regardless, bringing with it, in this case, a grotesque juxtaposition of funerals and fixtures. What price now the victory over Red Star Belgrade that sent the team overseas? The novel\u2019s modus operandi is also one of juxtaposition, of a kind in which voices and scenes appear to melt into one another, marked by tonal shifts that the disoriented reader apprehends just after they have taken place, consistently wrongfooted. Here is Cissie Charlton, mother of Bobby and Jackie, filled with a sense of doom before the event that Bobby, the second of her four sons, is in danger. She rings Old Trafford from a phone box, and later arrives there to help field calls, answer letters, make endless cups of her \u201cspecial tea\u201d. There is Jimmy Murphy, taking the managerial reins as Matt Busby lies critically ill in hospital, rousing the remnants of the team, phoning round clubs looking for replacement players, weeping over his rosary in his Whalley Range bedroom. Over there are the devastated landladies gathering together the belongings of the dead young players who had lodged with them, the taxi drivers offering survivors free rides, the kids scrabbling for tickets for the continuing season. In the novel\u2019s continuous present, time is relative: at Old Trafford, events accelerate, as the sporting calendar demands decisions nobody is ready to make, caught as they are in the far more exacting and unending schedule of grief. Before it seems even possible, signs of a slackening of sympathy begin to assert themselves, with the club slyly accused of mobilising sentimentality, of milking it. Meanwhile, the hospitalised watch the minutes of each day drift past, tormented by the guilt of having made it and, in Busby\u2019s case when he finally comes to know the scale of disaster, by anguished thoughts that there were players he might just as well have left back home. What elevates Munichs above a recitation of an event so repeatedly discussed and memorialised that it has acquired a near-mythological status is Peace\u2019s dogged devotion to particularity. The range of registers that he co-opts is incredible: he might switch from a bird\u2019s-eye view of Cabra, the Dublin suburb to which the body of Liam \u201cBilly\u201d Whelan is repatriated, to a meeting of pitiless aviation inspectors, before plunging into a match report delivered in sports journalese. He can train an eye on a rain-sodden cortege \u2013 the weather is almost another character throughout \u2013 and then put himself in the mind of a player wondering whether he will ever kick a ball again, or want to. And he is reticent, too, in narrating moments that seem to defy closer inspection, most notably as he describes the death of left-half Duncan Edwards two weeks after the crash, portraying it at a remove through the agonised vigil of his family and the sombre attentions of the medical staff. Implicit in Peace\u2019s account is the knowledge of where we are now; spectators in a global industry of extraordinary, obscene wealth, run by television companies and governing bodies with what frequently seems like contempt for the spirit and history of the game. The notes he repeatedly hits in mesmeric, metronymic prose could seem false, sentimental, nostalgic \u2013 the declarations of camaraderie, of triumph over tragedy, of glory sought to honour the men he consistently capitalises as The Dead \u2013 were they not tempered by the knowledge of what comes after. As in his two previous football novels, The Damned Utd and Red or Dead, Peace\u2019s attempts to anatomise the complex cultural, geographical and historical importance of sport are inextricable from what interests him about masculinity, citizenship and nationhood. All three books are conscious of the intersection of personal, social and environmental psychology, all determined that the uncommon \u2013 the egregious characters of Brian Clough and Bill Shankly, the randomness of a terrible accident \u2013 can reveal something of our shared beliefs and dispositions. Peace has explained that Munichs was written after the death of his father, who had suggested he pay attention to the events of February 1958 and to Jimmy Murphy, a reluctant occupant of the limelight who emerges as one of the novel\u2019s central and most absorbing consciousnesses. Here, again, is the need to understand what has preoccupied those closest to us, especially when we cannot access it directly. Born in 1967, Peace experienced these events and their wider context only as memory and retelling, to which he has now, valuably and valiantly, added his own. \u2022 Munichs by David Peace is published by Faber (\u00a320).

            "date": "2024-08-24T12:47:38Z",
            "content": "Hamas has sent a delegation to Cairo to be briefed on progress in peace talks, but an official from the group said it would not participate directly in the negotiations it had been boycotting for the past 10 days. Hamas representatives were expected on Saturday in the Egyptian capital, where negotiators from Israel, the US, Egypt and Qatar have been holding talks on a elusive deal that would involve the release of Israeli hostages, the freeing of Palestinian detainees and a ceasefire. The delegation was confirmed in a statement by a senior Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq, but another unnamed Hamas official, quoted by the French press agency AFP, said the Hamas representatives would not take part in the talks. The current sticking point in the negotiations is the insistence of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that any peace agreement must allow an Israeli presence along the Egypt-Gaza border, a strip of land known as the Philadelphi corridor, and on a road bisecting the Gaza Strip, the Netzarim corridor. Hamas has rejected any such presence, saying it contravenes a three-stage peace plan announced by Joe Biden at the end of May, and later endorsed by the UN security council, which ultimately envisages a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Hamas has said it accepts that deal, but has boycotted the current round of talks on the grounds that the proposal has been fundamentally changed, and it has rejected US claims that it has backed away from the agreement. The White House insists that the peace plan outlined by Biden has been accepted by Israel, but Netanyahu has repeatedly called its terms into question, vowing his government would continue the war until Hamas is completely obliterated. The prime minister insists that an Israeli presence in the Philadelphi corridor is essential to prevent arms smuggling to Hamas from Egypt. The government of Abdel Fatah al-Sisi in Cairo, has argued, however, that it has taken rigorous action against the smuggling and the cross-border smuggler tunnels and that an Israeli presence would raise questions about Egyptian sovereignty and territorial integrity. After a visit to the region by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, the US claimed to have secured Israeli agreement to a compromise solution, which it urged Hamas to accept, but has not so far released details of what it claimed was a \u201cbridging proposal\u201d. The US is represented at the Cairo talks by the Central Intelligence Agency director, William Burns, and the US special envoy to the region, Brett McGurk. Israel\u2019s lead negotiators are the directors of the Mossad spy agency and the Shin Bet security agency, David Barnea and Ronen Bar. The Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, was expected to arrive in Cairo on Saturday. As the talks continue in Cairo, Israel has kept up its military campaign, now in its 11th month, triggered by a Hamas surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October, which killed nearly 1,200 people, while another 250 were taken hostage. More than 100 hostages are still in Gaza but many of them are feared dead. According to the Gaza health authorities, more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during Israel\u2019s retaliatory military campaign. Fifty Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire in Gaza on Saturday alone. In recent weeks, Israel has issued an increasing number of evacuation orders to Palestinians in Gaza, nearly all of whom have already been displaced multiple times by the offensive and are living in makeshift camps. Many Palestinians sheltering in areas previously identified by Israel as \u201chumanitarian zones\u201d have been ordered to leave this month, with the result that the displaced population is being crammed into an ever shrinking area with minimal provision of food and water. Health conditions have constantly worsened and the World Health Organization has confirmed the first case of polio in Gaza for more than a quarter of a century, a baby partially paralysed by the virus, but reported to be in a stable condition. While the US and its regional allies have tried to keep negotiations alive to stop the bloodshed in Gaza, there have been persistent signs that the conflict has the capacity to spread across the region. Iran\u2019s ally, Hezbollah, has been exchanging fire with Israeli forces daily across the Lebanese-Israeli border, and there is a rising tide of violence on the West Bank, largely driven by extremist Israeli settlers. Bar has described the settler attacks on Palestinians as terrorism and a substantial threat to Israeli national security, because of the likelihood of them starting a spiral of violence. On Saturday afternoon, local media reported that two Israeli men had gone missing in the West Bank town of Qalqilya. An Israeli army effort to rescue them was met by roadside bombs, and an exchange of fire, the reports said. The fate of the two missing men was unclear by Saturday evening."

            "date": "2024-08-02T05:00:21Z",
            "content": "A previously unknown Roman fort discovered in Pembrokeshire in Wales overturns assumptions that the area\u2019s indigenous Celtic tribe was on peaceful terms with the Roman invaders. The site, which has excited archaeologists, had been hidden until now beneath an enormous, overgrown field. It explains why the land had been unsuccessful for farming: the farmer kept hitting stone. The discovery was made by Dr Mark Merrony, a leading Roman specialist and tutor at Oxford University, who said: \u201cIt is a humongous fort, an incredible find of national importance.\u201d He is all the more excited because it is right next to a Roman road that he has also identified for the first time. The fort is thought to date from the first to the third centuries, when the Celtic Demetae tribe inhabited the south-west area of modern Wales. They were thought to have been pro-Roman, meaning there was less need for a major military presence to quell local resistance. Merrony said that this fort suggested this part of Wales was considerably more militarised than previously thought: \u201cI now don\u2019t think they were pro-Roman at all, but that the Romans were hitting the area with an iron fist.\u201d He noted that its form and scale was like the only other Roman fort known in Pembrokeshire, excavated at Wiston near Haverfordwest in 2013. Both forts were now linked to a Roman road network that had not previously been known, he said. As \u201ca native of Pembrokeshire\u201d, Merrony had often travelled along a particularly straight road \u2013 wondering whether it was Roman \u2013 and, when he looked at satellite imagery recently, his eye was drawn to a field with dimensions likely to be a Roman fort. He drove to that field. \u201cSticking out of the ground was a triangular piece that looked like a Roman roofing slate. I thought: \u2018Surely not?\u2019 I pulled it up and lo and behold, it\u2019s an archetypal Roman roofing slate, an absolute peach. Flip it upside down and you can see underneath a diagonal line where it was grooved to fit into the one that was underneath it. It\u2019s a real beauty.\u201d He added: \u201cThat was the diagnostic evidence I was looking for, which is a miracle, because it\u2019s a huge site.\u201d Taking his computer, he knocked on the door of the local farmer: \u201cI said: \u2018I think you\u2019re in the middle of a Roman fort here.\u2019\u201d The farmer told him that the field was full of slate and stone. \u201cThat suggests there\u2019s a lot of material under the ground,\u201d Merrony said. \u201cThat\u2019s because there\u2019s obviously several collapsed buildings here. The slates are left, the timbers have rotted.\u201d He said that some of the roofing slates were stained with rust deposits from nails and showed chiselling marks and incisions that accommodated overlying or underlying slates: \u201cThese are diagnostically consistent with other slates from Romano-British buildings.\u201d The fort measures about 185 by 155 metres. Its footprint was \u201cfossilised\u201d by the parliamentary enclosure of large tracts of common land in the area during the 19th century, through banks, hedges and walls. Merrony said that its features ticked \u201call the boxes\u201d. It has a characteristic \u201cplaying-card\u201d form with rounded corners and is surrounded by a huge ditch with an outer bank or counterscarp and inner bank (scarp), \u201cwhich was almost certainly the base for the rampart\u201d: \u201cThe fort is strategically placed on sloping ground with an excellent vista overlooking a river valley, as was often the case. Its water supply drew upon two nearby springs.\u201d Merrony is the founding editor-in-chief of Antiqvvs, a quarterly magazine dedicated to archaeology, ancient art and history, where he will publish his latest research in August. His previous discoveries include two Roman villas, at Ford in Pembrokeshire and at Cutteslowe in Oxfordshire, which he found in 2002 and 2016 respectively. He also identified a Roman road along the southern shoulder of the Preselis in 2022, overturning assumptions that the Romans did not venture far into Wales. To protect the new discovery, its location cannot be disclosed at present. A geophysical survey would need to be conducted, Merrony said: \u201cThis will require funding and, given the extensive nature of this extraordinary discovery, it is desirable to involve the regional archaeological trusts.\u201d He expects to find evidence of an adjacent \u201cvicus\u201d, a typical civilian settlement that developed alongside a fort. He suggests that this was a Roman auxiliary fort, intended perhaps for a single unit of about 500 troops. He believes that the site will be declared a scheduled monument: \u201cIt is an absolute classic.\u201d"

            "content": "In April, an overnight ferry from the Senegalese capital, Dakar, arrived in Ziguinchor, capital of the southern region of Casamance, the first such voyage in more than 10 months. The reopening of the route came a few days after the former mayor of Ziguinchor, Ousmane Sonko, became prime minister, and together the developments marked a symbolic moment for what many hope will be a new era of national integration. For centuries, the region\u2019s location has fostered its isolation. Casamance is linked to the rest of southern Senegal by its eastern border, but its entire northern border runs alongs the Gambia, the roughly rectangular, English-speaking country that bisects Senegal. Since 1982 it has been the site of one of Africa\u2019s longest-running conflicts, launched by the separatist Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance, which grew out frustrations in the region over marginalisation and exploitation by the central government. The war continues at a low intensity today. Noah Ciss\u00e9, a Ziguinchor-based historian and teacher, said: \u201cSonko has shown [the people of Casamance] that they are Senegalese in their own right. They can claim power like any Senegalese.\u201d Ciss\u00e9 said he was hopeful that regional leaders could now persuade the government to invest in Casamance. \u201cThe [area] has been very strongly impacted by the conflict \u2026 war is incompatible with investment,\u201d he said. Rice and maize are cultivated in Casamance, where lush mangroves are watered by the river from which it gets its name \u2013 a contrast with the vegetation typical of the Sahel in the country\u2019s north. The white beaches of Cap Skirring, sometimes described as the jewel of Casamance, lead out to the ocean and attract thousands of tourists each year. Despite all of this, poverty levels in its three sub-regions are higher than the national average. This is because its pace of growth has historically been slower, said Ciss\u00e9. \u201cIf you look at the roads and railways, practically everything [French colonialists built in Senegal] was in the centre-west,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there was a sort of marginalisation of the outlying regions.\u201d *** Sonko originally ran for president in this year\u2019s election, but was in effect disqualified by a conviction for libel \u2013 one of a number of cases brought against him in recent years that he described as politically motivated. His friend, Bassirou Diomaye Faye, ran in his place and appointed him as PM after his victory in March. In June last year, another conviction \u2013 for corrupting young people \u2013 led to protests focused in Dakar and Ziguinchor that resulted in dozens of people being killed by the security forces and hundreds of arrests. Amadou Tom Mbodji, an activist detained for months and released on the eve of the vote, said: \u201cOur democracy was in danger.\u201d He is now working to free 300 youths he says are still in jail. The last government cited the unrest as a reason for halting ferry operations. Because the larger of Casamance\u2019s two airports has been closed for repair work, the only way for most people to travel between Dakar and Ziguinchor was an arduous nine-hour journey through the Gambia by road. Now the ferry reopening and Sonko\u2019s seat at the top has reawakened hopes of long-anticipated development and inclusion. Still, thousands of people remain displaced and unexploded devices are still being discovered in the area. According to the demining nonprofit group, Humanity &amp; Inclusion (HI), 33 explosive devices have been discovered and destroyed and 157,000 sq metres of land cleared in five villages in the region since 2022. Deploying demining teams along the borders with Guinea-Bissau to the south and the Gambia to the north, where the conflict simmers, is still an issue. HI\u2019s activities in Casamance were suspended in 2013 and again in 2019 after civilians in its teams were kidnapped. But it continues to work even as funding and other challenges stymy its pace. Seydou Gaye, HI\u2019s Dakar-based specialist in armed violence reduction, said: \u201c[We] hope \u2026 to help Senegal achieve its goal of becoming a mine-free country by March 2026.\u201d The new administration could help achieve that goal if it prioritises Casamance. Sonko, who saw the conflict first-hand while growing up, is now expected to juggle a delicate balancing act: strengthening peace in his back yard while pleasing the rest of the country. Henry Ndecky, a mediator in the conflict, said: \u201cOusmane Sonko as a son of Casamance and prime minister really has a hot potato in his hands \u2026 [If] the new team consolidates these commitments [with the rebel factions], it allows others to have confidence and go to negotiations and perhaps one day lay down their arms too.\u201d On the campaign trail, Faye promised to usher in a new era of prosperity in the region. Local activists say they can pressure the president and his prime minister until they make good on their promises. Madia Diop Sane\u0301, an activist and leader of the Citizen Visions Movement, said: \u201cWe are in the fight for good governance, the promotion of quality education, developing peace in Casamance and employment of young people.\u201d \u201cWe were born in war, we grew up in war, and we tell each other all the time that one cannot die and must not die in war.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 28 August 2024. An earlier version said that Casamance\u2019s population is predominantly Christian; however, this is only true for part of Casamance. The reference has been removed."

            "date": "2024-08-22T12:35:50Z",
            "content": "The Paris Olympics have provided a boost to the eurozone economy after a sharp rise in spending as athletes and spectators descended on the French capital for the summer sporting event. Figures from a closely watched survey of businesses showed monthly French private sector output rose to its highest level in 17 months in August. Economists said the growth in activity, fuelled by the French service sector as millions of tourists flocked to Paris for the two-and-a-half week sporting event, bolstered the figures for the entire 27-country bloc. The eurozone composite purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), conducted by the Hamburg Commercial Bank and S&amp;P Global, rose to 51.2 in August from 50.2 a month earlier, where anything above 50 signals growth. However, experts warned the Olympic boost masked a disappointing performance elsewhere, amid a slowdown in activity across the eurozone led by a collapse in manufacturing output, particularly in Germany. Bert Colijn, a senior economist for the eurozone at the Dutch bank ING, said: \u201cEurozone manufacturing continues to resemble Germany\u2019s performance at the Olympics: a big disappointment.\u201d Hosting the Olympic Games can deliver economic benefits, acting as a catalyst for construction, tourism and the events industry, as well as by raising the global profile of host countries and businesses. The UK government estimated that hosting the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games generated up to \u00a341bn for the British economy by 2020. The International Olympic Committee estimated the Paris Games could produce a $12.2bn (\u00a39.3bn) economic benefit within the \u00cele-de-France region, while the 2028 Los Angeles Games could provide an $18.3bn boost in output. However, while major sporting events can benefit some parts of the economy, they can also displace activity in other areas, making it difficult to quantify the net impact. Despite the boost to the French service sector, analysts warned the underlying picture for the wider eurozone economy suggested the outlook was weak enough to warrant another interest rate cut from the European Central Bank. Cyrus de la Rubia, the chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: \u201cA closer look at the numbers reveals that the underlying fundamentals might be shakier than they appear. \u201cThe boost largely comes from a surge in services activity in France, with the business activity index jumping by almost five points, likely linked to the buzz surrounding the Olympic Games in Paris. \u201cIt\u2019s doubtful this momentum will carry over into the coming months, however. Meanwhile, the overall pace of growth in the services sector has slowed down in Germany, and the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector remains in rapid decline.\u201d Separate PMI figures for the UK showed a rise in output to the highest level in four months after a robust upturn in new order intakes, helped by an upbeat assessment of the domestic economic outlook by businesses. The reading on the UK PMI composite output index increased from 52.8 in July to 53.4 in August. Thomas Pugh, an economist at RSM UK, said the figures suggested the Bank of England would probably wait until November before cutting interest rates again, and added: \u201cThe August PMIs point to an economy that is continuing to recover after last year\u2019s recession with output and employment rising and confidence remaining high.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-15T12:33:26Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy has extended its recovery from recession after recording growth of 0.6% in the three months to June, handing a boost to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in the run-up to the autumn budget. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show gross domestic product continued to grow in the second quarter, after a rise of 0.7% in the first three months of 2024. The reading matched the forecasts of City economists. However, monthly GDP growth was flat in June as wet weather deterred shoppers from spending in what has been a washout summer for retailers. Ben Jones, the lead economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said the figures showed the economy had \u201cfinally shaken off its slumber of recent years\u201d, but warned there were still challenges to sustainably boosting Britain\u2019s long-term growth rate. \u201cWe think the quarterly data probably overstates the underlying momentum in the economy, with recent CBI surveys of activity remaining fairly subdued,\u201d he said. \u201cBut firms nonetheless appear confident that the recovery will continue.\u201d According to the latest snapshot, service sector output increased by 0.8% in the second quarter, powered by scientific research and development. There was also strength in the IT, transport, law, architecture and engineering sectors. Consumer-facing service output fell by 0.1%, reflecting a weaker period for purchases of physical goods amid the cost of living crisis and poor weather hitting retail sales. Manufacturing and construction output also fell. The UK has grown at a faster pace this year than many forecasters predicted, in a development seized on by the shadow chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, as evidence that the previous government had helped the economy to turn a corner. \u201cToday\u2019s figures are yet further proof that Labour have inherited a growing and resilient economy. The chancellor\u2019s attempt to blame her economic inheritance on her decision to raise taxes \u2013 tax rises she had always planned \u2013 will not wash with the public,\u201d he said. The latest figures show the UK recorded the strongest growth in the G7 group of advanced economies over the past six months. The second-quarter growth rate of 0.6% compares with 0.3% in the eurozone, and 0.7% in the US. However, it comes after a lacklustre performance over the past decade, and high living costs, elevated interest rates and faltering productivity gains are acting as a brake on momentum. The UK economy entered recession \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of falling GDP \u2013 in the second half of last year as households cut back on spending. Reeves has said rebooting the economy is Labour\u2019s number one priority, arguing that stronger growth will help to boost living standards and raise more tax revenue to repair battered public services. The chancellor will deliver an autumn budget on 30 October. \u201cThe new government is under no illusion as to the scale of the challenge we have inherited after more than a decade of low economic growth and a \u00a322bn black hole in the public finances,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why we have made economic growth our national mission and we are taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations, so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of the country better off.\u201d Experts said the recent strength in the economy would be unlikely to last. Earlier this month, the Bank of England raised its growth forecast from 0.5% to 1.25% for 2024, but warned of a weaker medium-term outlook as high interest rates hit activity. Figures released on Wednesday showed inflation rose by less than expected in July to 2.2%. The continued strong GDP growth in the second quarter of the year may mean that the Bank delays interest rate cuts until past September, according to financial market bets. The Bank is expected to leave rates unchanged at 5% when rate-setters meet next month, before making a 0.25%-point rate cut at the following meeting in November. Much of the recent expansion has been driven by a growing population. The latest figures showed GDP per head, an important barometer of living standards, was 0.1% lower than a year earlier in the second quarter, and 0.8% below pre-pandemic levels. Simon Pittaway, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cBritain\u2019s medium-term record is far less impressive, and has been driven by a growing population rather than rising productivity. \u201cWithout a return to productivity growth, living standards will continue to stagnate and Britain will continue to fall behind its peers.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-09T17:41:21Z",
            "content": "Black Americans strongly support initiatives that would increase the minimum wage to $17, make affordable housing more accessible and create an equitable tax system, according to Black to the Future Action Fund, a political advocacy thinktank. On Thursday, the group released a 55-page economic agenda based on its 2023 survey of 211,219 Black people across all 50 states. The organization hopes that the report will serve as a roadmap for elected officials to address policy holes, and for advocates to generate campaigns that hold politicians accountable. \u201cWe have to start imagining what it is that we want and not be so afraid to break out of what is,\u201d said Alicia Garza, founder and former principal of Black to the Future Action Fund, at a Thursday symposium in Atlanta. The agenda suggests a range of policy shifts around worker protections, housing, healthcare, childcare, higher education and taxes, along with examples of successful models already implemented by some state governments and municipalities. \u201cEconomic insecurity experienced by Black communities cannot be resolved solely by individual actions like working more hours, getting a college degree or saving money to buy a home,\u201d the agenda\u2019s authors wrote. \u201cThese issues are systemic, and government intervention is required to eliminate these inequities and improve outcomes for our people.\u201d Along with increasing the minimum wage to $17, the authors also recommended that elected officials pass labor protections for domestic workers, many of whom are Black women. The expansion of paid family and medical leave laws would help workers care for their household. And on the topic of affordable housing, the thinktank recommended laws that ensure rent payments are incorporated into credit scores so that renters have greater access to obtaining home mortgages. Another suggestion for affordable housing included the development of shared equity programs, which use public or private investments to build or buy homes that are then sold at a reduced rate to low-to-moderate income homebuyers. There are currently 250,000 shared equity models mainly in New York City, according to the agenda. Christopher Towler, a political science associate professor at Sacramento State University and director of the Black Voter Project, called the programs \u201ca really good model to try and get people into the housing market for there to be more first-time homebuyers\u201d. The origins of the US\u2019s persistent racial wealth can be traced back to the transatlantic slave trade, when enslaved Black people were barred from accessing capital generated by their forced labor. During the Reconstruction period after the civil war, then president Andrew Johnson rescinded the 40 acres (16 hectares) of land promised to formerly enslaved Black people. When Black communities did secure economic freedom, they were sometimes violently attacked by angry white mobs, including during the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, where an estimated 300 people were killed. Additionally, banks often denied home loans to Black Americans from the early 20th century until the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that outlawed housing discrimination. \u201cThe failures of Reconstruction have yet to be made up,\u201d said Towler. \u201cAnd a large part of that is the continued residential segregation and how Black Americans have been locked out, not only of the housing market, but of the resources, the wealth, the opportunity that comes along with where you live and your access to community.\u201d The legacy of systemic inequality has a continued impact on Black workers today, who earn less than US workers overall, according to 2022 Bureau of Labor Statistics data cited by Pew Research Center. The median weekly earnings of Black full-time wage and salary workers is $878, compared to $1,059 for all US workers, according to Pew. During Thursday\u2019s symposium, the actor and activist Kendrick Sampson, the singer and songwriter Trae Crockett, and the digital storyteller Conscious Lee spoke with Garza about the need for Black communities to brainstorm needed solutions and to band together to effect political change. \u201cWhen it comes to healthcare,\u201d said Lee, \u201ca lot of us \u2026 have internalized the Black inferiority when it comes to that industry. So for me, it\u2019s really reimagining what it looks like for my grandma to get affordable insulin.\u201d Black census respondents listed a lack of affordable healthcare as their fourth most immediate economic concern. Expanding Medicaid to the 10 states that have not done so under the Affordable Care Act could help keep rural hospitals open. \u201cThe communities most affected when these rural hospitals close often have significant Black populations,\u201d the report stated, \u201cand closure means rural residents must drive 25 or more miles to access medical care.\u201d While Towler lauded the agenda as the first one he\u2019s seen that addresses the concerns of Black communities nationwide, he believes that it will be a \u201ctough sell\u201d to mobilize Black voters. \u201cAny sort of policy promises right now are going to be looked at with some hesitations, simply because the Biden administration\u2019s policy agenda, although very numerous in its accomplishments, is still in some ways misunderstood,\u201d said Towler. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of knowledge with the common voter about how the policies that Biden passed have actually affected their individual lives.\u201d According to his research, Towler said that people are encouraged to be civically engaged when they\u2019re taught how political institutions uphold the status quo to resist change: \u201cIf you even want there to be a possibility of reparations, we have to continue to vote, continue to be active and continue to put in place policy makers and legislators that are working towards that.\u201d At the end of the symposium, organizers asked participants to share the agenda with their network and elected officials. In the eyes of the Black to the Future Action Fund, the electorate is capable of shifting policy through mass mobilization. \u201cWe are the power,\u201d Sampson said toward the end of the symposium. \u201cIf we all are in alignment and we go in the same direction, now we are more powerful.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-28T15:03:25Z",
            "content": "Before a whistlestop European tour to Berlin and Paris, Keir Starmer promised to mend \u201cthe broken relationships left behind by the previous government\u201d and drive forward UK economic growth. Changing the tone with European leaders is the easy bit. Changing the substance \u2013 especially finding new arrangements to boost growth \u2013 is a much taller order. Starmer, who reiterated in Berlin on Wednesday that growth was \u201cthe number one mission of my government\u201d, is not the first prime minister to find economic ambitions crimped by self-imposed red lines on Europe. Labour has ruled out rejoining the EU\u2019s single market and customs union, the steps that would have the biggest impact in improving trade with the EU. Instead, the Labour manifesto promised to tear down \u201cunnecessary barriers to trade\u201d by negotiating a veterinary agreement with the EU, improving access for touring artists to the continent and striking mutual recognition agreements for professionals. Such policies amount to little more than \u201ctinkering around the edges of the relationship\u201d and would do little to \u201caddress the continuing economic impacts of Brexit\u201d, concluded a recent report from the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe (UKice). Meanwhile, the Office for Budget Responsibility, backed by independent economists, has said its forecast for a 15% reduction in trade as a result of Brexit was \u201cbroadly on track\u201d. Academics at UKice expect that the veterinary agreement could boost UK agri-food exports by 22.5%, a lifeline for some small businesses but not decisive for the overall economy. Labour hopes it can deepen the economic relationship without joining the EU\u2019s structures. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, for instance, has suggested a \u201cbespoke\u201d arrangement for the chemicals industry to avoid \u00a32bn of extra costs mostly associated with duplicating EU requirements. Talk of bespoke deals raises the ghosts that haunted the Brexit negotiations, namely the UK taking the benefits of the single market free from the EU\u2019s common rules, enforcement or budget payments. \u201cPeople will soon rediscover there is a reason why there were red lines,\u201d a senior EU official told the Guardian. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is to have the single market cut in pieces. The UK \u2013 they are very good negotiators and they always want to cherrypick.\u201d That said, officials are not expecting the enormous mismatch of expectations that bedevilled the early years of Brexit negotiations under Theresa May. Starmer, a regular visitor to Brussels when he was Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow Brexit secretary, is well known in the EU capital. He and his team \u201care well advised\u201d, the senior official said. \u201cThey know what is feasible, what is not feasible.\u201d One EU diplomat from a large member state expressed concern that the UK government was not being straightforward with British voters about EU demands. \u201cThey have to be honest with their public. We are not a shelf you can pick things off,\u201d they said. The EU has been disappointed by Labour\u2019s dismissive response to a proposed youth mobility scheme that would allow people aged 18-30 to work, live, study or travel for up to four years. Nils Schmid, the foreign affairs spokesperson for Olaf Scholz\u2019s SPD party in the Bundestag, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that a youth mobility scheme was \u201ca major feature of our wishlist\u201d, but \u201cnot about immigration in a general sense\u201d. Yet when answering a parliamentary question about the scheme in July, Starmer framed it in general terms: \u201cWe are not returning to freedom of movement.\u201d In Berlin, however, he struck a more nuanced approach that seemed to leave the door open to some kind of youth mobility programme. The earlier outright rejection dismayed the EU, especially its repeated conflation of a time-limited youth mobility scheme with free movement of people, a lifelong right for EU citizens. The EU diplomat expressed disappointment over Labour \u201cdismissing it right out of hand because it looks like free movement [when] it is not free movement at all\u201d. The person added: \u201cI am personally surprised they think it\u2019s toxic when [the UK has] the same arrangement with others,\u201d referring to a UK-Australia agreement. Starmer\u2019s government will face other EU demands. France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and other coastal states want to ensure post-Brexit fishing rights are extended beyond June 2026 when current arrangements lapse. Meanwhile, the European Commission insists that the UK must fully implement existing agreements before negotiating new ones, amid concern over the rights of the estimated 3.5 million EU citizens living in the UK. Late last month the commission announced it was moving forward with a legal case begun in 2020 that alleges that the UK government has failed to protect EU citizens in the UK. \u201cWe have two big agreements with the UK and we want them to be implemented,\u201d said a second EU diplomat, referring to the Brexit withdrawal agreement and subsequent trade and cooperation agreement. With Starmer expected to meet the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, soon and a UK-EU summit pencilled in for spring 2025, the government has more to do to repair the broken relationships of the past."

            "date": "2024-08-06T11:15:49Z",
            "content": "Young protesters in Kenya successfully demanded the withdrawal of a bill that would have raised taxes on everything from bread to vegetable oil and sanitary towels. Inspired by their neighbours, Ugandans marched against corruption. Nigerians rallied against \u201cbad governance\u201d and the soaring cost of living. Since the Covid pandemic, people have also taken to the streets in several other African countries including Ghana, Angola, Malawi and Senegal. While each protest has had unique drivers, they have some things in common \u2013 booming young populations struggling with high inflation, a lack of good jobs and a political class that they don\u2019t trust. \u201cHere in Kenya, if you look at these protests, actually, they were led by educated people. But most of them [were] jobless,\u201d said Anthony Kamande, an inequality researcher at Oxfam, based in Nairobi. Africa is a young continent \u2013 70% of the population is under the age of 30, according to the UN. Its population is expected to almost double in 30 years, to 2.2 billion. Gen Z and millennial Africans are better educated than the generations before them. Of 22 countries that provided data to Unesco for 2011 to 2021, the proportion of students going on to higher education fell in only three. However, more than 10 million people are entering the workforce each year in sub-Saharan Africa, vying for just 3m jobs, according to the World Bank. Many of those who don\u2019t get formal work hustle in the badly paid, risky informal sector. Unemployment was ranked as the most important problem by 18- to 35-year-olds surveyed by the pan-African survey organisation Afrobarometer. On top of this, the economic shocks of the past few years \u2013 Covid, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sending food, fuel and fertiliser prices soaring, and the US central bank\u2019s interest rate hikes pushing up borrowing costs globally \u2013 have triggered cost of living crises in many countries. Inflation was still double-digits in about a third of sub-Saharan African countries earlier this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. In Nigeria, it is running above 34% after the removal of a costly fuel subsidy and a botched series of currency devaluations. These policy changes, which started when Bola Tinubu took office as president in May 2023, didn\u2019t cause protests immediately. \u201cPrior to the presidential election in 2023, each of the three candidates said FX [foreign exchange] liberalisation needs to happen and the fuel subsidy is unaffordable and needs to go,\u201d said Razia Khan, Middle East and Africa chief economist at Standard Chartered bank. \u201cThere was just an acceptance on the part of Nigerians.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a year after the initial fuel subsidy removal that we\u2019re seeing protests and that\u2019s really driven by the fact that the cost of living crisis has not eased meaningfully and that inflation continues to be at runaway levels,\u201d she added. In contrast, in Kenya, tax rises were never broadly accepted. Protesters \u201cfeel that those in government, and parliamentarians in some cases, should also bear the pain by cutting spending\u201d, said Yvonne Mhango, Africa economist at Bloomberg, pointing to the now-axed offices of Kenya\u2019s first and second ladies. Kamande, the Oxfam researcher, also blamed rising inequality and a debt crisis that has led to cash-strapped governments trying to raise taxes on ordinary people. \u201cWe need debt cancellation. It\u2019s long overdue \u2013 it should have happened yesterday,\u201d he said. Heavy debt burdens have swallowed up public spending. Kenya is spending a third of government revenues servicing its debt. In Ghana, half of government income went on debt servicing in 2022, before it defaulted at the end of that year. Ethiopia is also restructuring its debt, while trying to avoid the soaring inflation that Nigeria has experienced since devaluing its currency. The east African country let its birr currency weaken 30% against the US dollar last week. Later that day, the IMF signed off on a $3.4bn (\u00a32,68bn), four-year loan. Ethiopia is also expected to get $16.6bn from the World Bank over the next three years. While an artificially strong exchange rate is not necessarily sustainable, the fallout from devaluations can be painful, said Daouda Sembene, the chief executive of the Dakar-based consultancy Africatalyst. \u201cAttention also needs to be put \u2026 to make sure that those who are likely to suffer from it are protected,\u201d said Sembene, a former IMF executive director. Many of the pressures fuelling recent protests were not going away, said Charlie Robertson, head of macro-strategy at FIM Partners, which manages investments in emerging market countries: \u201cPolitical protest is all that educated youth have.\u201d"

The research and development tax credits scheme was designed to help drive world-leading innovation, but turned into what has been described by experts as a \u201cwild west\u201d with huge volumes of dubious claims. Alleged claims of groundbreaking research included a safer method developed by a window-cleaning firm to hold a water bucket at height; adding vegan and gluten-free options to a pub menu; and redesigning corporate websites. The scheme was described as \u201cfree money\u201d by some agents.

Tax officials said that the error and fraud in R&amp;D tax relief revealed in the report was \u201cclearly unacceptable\u201d and the public would expect action. Colin Hailey, a technology tax expert who has given evidence to parliament on the tax reliefs, said he and other advisers were warning about the abuses in the scheme more than six years ago. He said claims were not being properly vetted by HMRC and the increase was driven by agents claiming hefty commissions. \u201cThere was an industrialisation of the claims process with all these advisers saying they were experts and could sort the claims for between 20% and 30% of the value,\u201d Hailey said. \u201cIt was the wild west. These advisers were cold-calling firms and saying, \u2018you don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing R&amp;D, but we can help you\u2019. \u201cI remember talking to tax inspectors in Manchester saying, \u2018we had a claim from a window-cleaning company who were claiming for the R&amp;D of hanging a bucket on the other side of the ladder.\u2019 It was quite rightly thrown out, but they knew these claims were out there.\u201d Firms complained of being inundated with calls by agents, urging them to sign up for the tax credits. Operators of care homes, pubs, fitness centres and dental clinics were told to apply for the tax credits, based upon their best ideas for improving business. One tax consultancy claimed on its website it had saved a hotel and pub in Chester \u00a328,000 with a claim for \u201cinnovative menus, catering for vegan and gluten-free diets\u201d. The firm and the pub considered the claim was permissible, because of \u201call the hard work that goes into crafting our menus\u201d. HMRC did not respond to a request for a comment about whether the tax reliefs said to have been claimed by the hotel and pub business were legitimate. A House of Lords finance bill subcommittee hearing was told in November 2022 that some advisers were claiming \u201csome 99% of our claims are accepted by HMRC. It\u2019s free money.\u201d It was alleged that agents were encouraging firms to claim for activity that would not normally be classed as research, such as redesigning a website. The tax relief was first introduced in 2000 in response to evidence that Britain\u2019s R&amp;D spending was falling behind that of its competitors. The scheme works by reducing a firm\u2019s corporation tax bill or by making a direct payment to the business. A valid claim must represent a significant advance that overcomes scientific or technological uncertainty and which \u201ccould not easily be worked out by a professional in the field\u201d. The HMRC annual accounts published last week reveal that the projected and final estimates of the value of error and fraud in the scheme was \u00a31.127bn in 2020-21; \u00a31.337bn in 2021-22; \u00a31.051bn in 2022-23; and \u00a3601m in 2023-24. According to the report, one analysis of claims for small and medium-sized firms in 2021-22 estimated that about one in four contained error or fraud, which was described as \u201camong the highest reported across all government spending programmes, including those administered in response to the pandemic\u201d. Officials are now checking claims more rigorously while hoping to recoup some of the billions of pounds lost through error or fraud. They will also increase the number of compliance inquiries. An HMRC spokesperson said: \u201cWe generated a record \u00a3843.4bn in tax revenues last year, up 3.6% on the previous 12 months. \u201cWith R&amp;D claims, public money is at stake and taxpayers rightly expect us to scrutinise them. We do that thoroughly and fairly, and the overwhelming majority of valid claims are paid on time. \u201cBut the levels of non-compliance that we are seeing within these schemes are clearly unacceptable and the public rightly expect us to take action. This includes better help, guidance and processes, as well as decisive action against the minority who deliberately set out to abuse the schemes.\u201d"

The interview with Meg O\u2019Neill, which was temporarily taken down from YouTube, iView and ABC News, was later republished with an editor\u2019s note that read: \u201cThis interview has been reposted with an updated headline and thumbnail to better reflect the content of the interview.\u201d The headline now reads \u201cWoodside CEO confirms changes to Browse project to try to satisfy environmental concerns\u201d. The multibillion-dollar Woodside gas export development Browse has been deemed \u201cunacceptable\u201d by the state\u2019s Environmental Protection Authority due to its impact on marine life at Scott Reef. The climate scientist Bill Hare, who is the chief executive of Climate Analytics, said it was \u201cquite a shock\u201d to see the \u201claughable\u201d headline, while he felt the content of the seven-minute interview with O\u2019Neill fell well below ABC standards. \u201cThe interview looks more like something you\u2019d see on Moscow TV or on public broadcasters in China, where it looks more like an advertorial, political advertorial,\u201d Hare told Guardian Australia. Sign up for the Weekly Beast newsletter, our free Australian media email Hare was critical of the questions put to O\u2019Neill, saying he felt there was \u201cno meaningful questioning\u201d of the statements made by the Woodside CEO. \u201cThere was no follow-up or meaningful questioning of the statements made by the Woodside CEO, most of which are contested.\u201d ABC News said the videos across the platforms had been removed temporarily to change the headline. \u201cThe interview was for The Business and focused on the company\u2019s earnings and outlook,\u201d a spokesperson for ABC News said. \u201cIt takes greenwashing to another level,\u201d Hare said. \u201cIt\u2019s an innovation in greenwashing. It\u2019s one of the most extraordinary innovations I\u2019ve ever seen, and somehow for the ABC to put that up as a headline is just laughable.\u201d A question about mitigating potential impacts on sea life appeared to be the basis for the headline about saving whales. Interviewer: \u201cIs there more that Woodside can do to actually mitigate against potential impacts to pygmy whales and endangered sea turtle nesting areas?\u201d O\u2019Neill: \u201cThere are a number of changes that we have already made to the Browse design to make sure that we are minimising any potential environmental impact.\u201d O\u2019Neill went on to say Woodside was working with the Australian Institute for Marine Science and the Western Australian Museum to \u201cbuild the nation\u2019s understanding of the marine life in this particular part of the world\u201d. Woodside suffered an embarrassing rebuke of its climate credentials after its emissions plan was overwhelmingly rejected by shareholders at its annual general meeting earlier this year. The former Walkley award winning ABC foreign correspondent Sophie McNeill, who is a Greens candidate in the WA election, was also critical of the video. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the framing,\u201d McNeill said. \u201c[The ABC] repeated Woodside talking points and did not push back against any of O\u2019Neill\u2019s claims, many of which have been disproven by climate, energy and environmental experts.\u201d Woodside declined to comment."

            "date": "2024-08-19T04:00:48Z",
            "content": "It began over a pint in a Bedford pub. Fifty years later, Paines Plough is a theatrical trailblazer. Dedicated to new plays, the company has presented the work of pivotal dramatists such as David Pownall, Sarah Kane, James Graham, Kae Tempest, Mike Bartlett \u2013 and more than 300 others. Actors who have gone on the road with the company include Harriet Walter, Peter Capaldi, Claire Foy, Ben Whishaw and Andrew Scott. To mark its half-century, the key players remember the company\u2019s fights, firsts and furious creativity. John Adams (founding artistic director): We all met in Bedford, where I was living, and went for a drink to a pub called the Plough, where the beer was brewed by a St Neots company called Paines, in 1974. A wonderful actor called Chris Crooks had asked the playwright David Pownall to write him a one-man play. Andrew Leigh, the general manager at the Edinburgh Lyceum, said we could use the studio for three performances in the 1975 fringe. The play, Crates on Barrels, was about a disciple of Diogenes the Cynic who lived in a barrel so we drove up to Edinburgh pulling a trailer with an eight-foot barrel: we had to cut it in two to get it into certain places. One night, there were four people in the audience, one of whom was Irving Wardle who wrote a very good review in the Times. I used that review to sell our next project. We went back in 1976 with Music to Murder By, which won a Fringe First award and you couldn\u2019t get a ticket. It went on the road for 18 months. There would be no Paines Plough without the Edinburgh fringe. We didn\u2019t have a stage manager and when we arrived at a place, we\u2019d all lump everything out of the Ford Transit. The actor Fiona Victory would do the costumes then had to do her Renaissance hair. Diana Kyle, another actor, would set up the sound and I would do the lighting. The deal was we had to be out of the theatre before the pubs shut at 10.30pm. We were guerrilla theatre. Donna Franceschild (playwright): Songs for Stray Cats and Other Living Creatures was the 10th anniversary production in 1985. Pip Broughton was the director and it was the most extraordinary cast: Josie Lawrence, who played the lead, John McGlynn, Peter Capaldi, George Rossie and Elaine Collins. Peter Capaldi was just so funny and had a natural humanity, a genuinely lovely person. He and Elaine got together during the rehearsals. One afternoon before a performance, we were all hanging out in the Tron bar in Glasgow and Elaine\u2019s previous boyfriend came in, found Peter and punched him hard enough to knock him off the chair. Well into the second act, Peter\u2019s character makes a quixotic attempt to beat up another guy. After that happens, he has bruises on his face, but he had the bruises right from the beginning! Katie Posner (current co-artistic director): The writers Plaines Plough has produced are some of the greatest we have in Britain. We were doing a tidy-up upstairs and we found the second draft of Sarah Kane\u2019s Crave with notes from Vicky Featherstone. Vicky Featherstone (former artistic director): When I arrived at Paines Plough in 1997, Mark Ravenhill was literary manager and Sarah Kane became writer in residence. Her theory was that no writer ever really wanted to write. She said it was too lonely a business and you had to literally lock them in a space to do it. She came up with the Lock In: six writers would arrive on the Saturday morning and weren\u2019t allowed anything from outside, no phone calls, nothing. We would bring them food, they would write, go home, come in the next day and write again. Only a writer would ever dare to suggest that. Imagine if I suggested taking writers\u2019 phones away and forcing them to write! Dennis Kelly (playwright): During the Lock In, I wrote the first two acts of Osama the Hero, which I went on to do at Hampstead theatre in 2005, so it was instrumental for me. VF: Sarah was running our Wild Lunch writers\u2019 group. She wrote Crave in 1998 because the intended play by Rebecca Prichard got picked up by the Royal Court. There was no point in us doing a lunchtime reading of the same play so I asked Sarah if she would write something. She said, \u201cI will, but we need to come up with a title and an idea, then I\u2019ll do it under a pseudonym.\u201d She thought it would be liberating because she couldn\u2019t imagine writing anything again after Blasted at the Royal Court. We came up with the title together in the pub, then she went off for four days and came back with the first draft of Crave. It happened out of necessity. DK: I remember going in for a meeting with Vicky Featherstone and John Tiffany. I was really surprised to come out as their writer in residence. I said nothing, I just let them carry on talking. By the end of the conversation, they even managed to talk themselves into commissioning my play After the End. It felt like if I\u2019d have kept quiet for a little longer, I\u2019d have got a car. JA: Because we had no money, I lived in David Pownall\u2019s house sleeping in a cupboard for a year. It was back in the days when you got paid your unemployment benefit irrespective. That system subsidised Paines Plough for the first year or two. We learned the whereabouts of the employment exchanges of northern England, would sign on, then get back on with doing art. We didn\u2019t have to do business plans or applications saying who it would appeal to. We just did the work. VF: In those days people could be paid to have a bit of time and space just to exist. One of the hard things for artists now is you have to set out what the outcome is before you\u2019ve even said what the idea is. DK: I didn\u2019t understand what a writer in residence was. I kept thinking, \u201cThey\u2019re going to ask me to do something.\u201d They said, \u201cWhat we want you to do is hang around and just chat.\u201d I kept thinking, \u201cShould I sharpen some pencils or something?\u201d Somebody Jones (playwright fellow):\u200a I became playwright fellow in 2023 and was much more involved than I expected. As a writer, even if you have a good relationship with a theatre, you feel like you send your play off into the ether. It was so cool being on the other side. And it helps the theatre because you have someone coming in with fresh eyes. DK: I\u2019d be in the building and Mark Ravenhill had been working next door and I\u2019d be starstruck. People would come in, like Enda Walsh and Abi Morgan, these writers I really looked up to. Being exposed to that makes you feel like you can do it, you can have a go. SJ: On my first day, everyone was like: \u201cOh, let me give you some plays to read.\u201d I have a giant stack of plays. It was so important because you can\u2019t know the entire 50-year history of a company. It\u2019s helped in ways I don\u2019t even think they\u2019ve realised. Charlotte Bennett (current co-artistic director): Part of the company\u2019s survival lies in its innovation. It is in the nature of new stories to find new ways of doing things. KP: There can always be another way. We don\u2019t sit there going: \u201cThis is what you need to do to be the best playwright ever.\u201d We empower writers to be who they are. We like being bespoke. CB: It is no surprise that we founded the Women\u2019s prize for playwriting with Ellie Keel within our first two months in post. It felt in line with the ethos of the company. DK: You can develop your voice at Paines Plough. I did After the End and Orphans with director Roxana Silbert and Our Teacher\u2019s a Troll with George Perrin. When I went on to do Matilda the Musical for the RSC and Utopia on Channel 4, the experience of having been able to say the thing I meant to say was invaluable. If you go off and do those TV things straight away, your voice will get battered out of you. JA: David Pownall, Chris Crooks and I used to go walking together. A lifestyle that said, \u201cLet\u2019s walk in the hills and then put on plays in the evening\u201d was very amenable to us. We were non-metropolitan. CB: I grew up near Selby, which is not that glamorous. In 2022, we toured Amy Trigg\u2019s Reasons You Should(n\u2019t) Love Me to Selby town hall where my friends and I used to go to battle of the bands and get drunk when we were 16. This award-winning play that had a major run in London holds as much weight for us in that space as it would in the West End. Our predecessors, George Perrin and James Grieve, invented the Roundabout, a 167-seater portable pop-up theatre. You tour the entire venue with the plays in it. You come out and you\u2019re in the Edinburgh festival or you\u2019re in Newington council estate in Ramsgate or a beach in Poole, but you\u2019ve had the same experience. It\u2019s magical. KB: There is something visceral about seeing everybody around you in the Roundabout and, whether you like the play or not, it doesn\u2019t matter because you\u2019ve done something together. One of my favourite moments was Daniel Kitson\u2019s 2023 play First Thing when he asked the audience to tell the story with him. Every single one of us got a script and a line. It was so special to share something together. VF: Paines Plough\u2019s mission is incredibly pure \u2013 it\u2019s always been about the writer and it\u2019s always peripatetic. The purest missions are the ones that endure because they were created for the right reason. Paines Plough\u2019s Roundabout is at Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 26 August"

            "date": "2024-08-17T15:00:03Z",
            "content": "Earlier this month, a district court in Washington DC handed down a judgment in an antitrust case that has shaken up the tech industry. In a 286-page opinion, Judge Amit Mehta announced his conclusion. \u201cAfter having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\u201d Now I know that for normal, well-adjusted people, antitrust cases are an excellent antidote to insomnia, but stay tuned for a moment because this is a really big deal. Apart from anything else, it shows that an ancient legal warhorse, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, still has teeth. And to see it successfully deployed to bring an overbearing tech company to heel is a delight. After all, it was the statute that in 1911 broke up John D Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil as well as American Tobacco, and AT&amp;T in 1982. It was also used to prosecute Microsoft in 1998. Section 2 of the act says that \u201cEvery person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d The misdemeanour of which the US Department of Justice accused Google was simple: it was paying tens of billions of dollars a year to companies that distribute search engines \u2013 notably Apple, LG, Motorola, Samsung, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Mozilla, Opera, UCWeb, and Verizon \u2013 to make sure that its was the only search engine consumers saw. To that end it was forking out nearly $18bn (\u00a314bn) to Apple to make Google the default search engine on its iPhones and other iDevices. Samsung was pocketing $8bn a year for ensuring that Google was the default search engine on its phones. And even poor little Mozilla (the creator of the Firefox browser) was getting $500m a year \u2013 which was probably most of its income. In other words, as one commentator put it, Google \u201cbought up all the shelf space. Such a tactic, a monopolist paying off partners to prevent distribution of a rival, is called \u2018monopoly maintenance\u2019.\u201d And it worked. Nobody in the tech industry underestimates the power of default settings. It comes from the sad fact that most users of digital devices never change the defaults. If your smartphone/laptop/browser comes with Google search as its default, then you will almost certainly wind up as a Google user. This is the case even when other search engines are, in fact, available. Mehta understood this well. \u201cGoogle,\u201d he writes at one point, \u201chas a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution.\u201d Google argued in court that the fact that most people used Google simply confirmed that it was the best search engine. In which case, came the (obvious) riposte, why was the company giving nearly $20bn to Apple to make sure that they did? The main thrust of the government\u2019s case was that Google\u2019s 90%-plus share of the search market gives it overwhelming power, and that it was using payment-for-defaults as a way of maintaining that dominance. So it is anti-competitive, but in interesting ways. \u201cThe default is extremely valuable real estate,\u201d writes Mehta. \u201cBecause many users simply stick to searching with the default, Google receives billions of queries every day through those access points. Google derives extraordinary volumes of user data from such searches. It then uses that information to improve search quality. Google so values such data that, absent a user-initiated change, it stores 18 months\u2019 worth of a user\u2019s search history and activity.\u201d Other search engines have much less user-data, and therefore find it harder to compete. One of the questions raised by the court proceedings is why, given that Google has such a virtuous circle for improving its search engine, does its quality seem to be deteriorating over time? After all, many discerning internet users no longer use it, preferring alternatives such as DuckDuckGo instead. The obvious answer is that if you are a monopolist with no serious competition, then you don\u2019t have to innovate, and can milk your users ruthlessly, as Google has been doing for several years \u2013 to the point where for many searches you have to wade through a screenful of ads before getting to \u201corganic\u201d search results. Another question is, why didn\u2019t Apple develop its own search engine for its devices? The answer, it seems, is that it had originally embarked on such a billion-dollar project, but then Google arrived waving all that monopoly money. So the Apple engine went on the back-burner and was never seen again. If Mehta\u2019s judgment \u2013 that default-placement is illegal \u2013 survives the inevitable appeal, then maybe one day we\u2019ll have an Apple search engine, just as we now have Apple Maps as a viable alternative to Google\u2019s cartography. In which case competition will have been good for consumers as well as for Google\u2019s soul, assuming it has one. What I\u2019ve been reading Conventional thinking Richard Nixon: My Part in His Downfall is a nice memoir piece by Lawrence Freedman on his youthful participation in the 1972 Democratic convention. Treatment for parasites Cory Doctorow has a fine blast against the hyenas of capitalism \u2013 private equity operators \u2013 in this essay.

            "date": "2024-08-01T13:30:02Z",
            "content": "More than 100 countries \u2013 including China, India, Brazil and South Africa \u2013 risk becoming stuck in a \u201cmiddle-income trap\u201d unless they adopt radical growth strategies for their economies, the World Bank has said. The Washington-based development organisation said emerging market nations would struggle to close the gap on US living standards unless they relied less heavily on investment to increase growth. In its World Development Report, the World Bank said the lesson of the past 50 years was that as countries grew wealthier they hit a \u201ctrap\u201d where incomes per head averaged at about 10% of US levels \u2013 the equivalent of $8,000 (\u00a36,261). Since 1990, only 34 middle-income economies had managed to shift to high-income status \u2013 with more than a third of them either beneficiaries of integration into the European Union, or of previously undiscovered oil. Indermit Gill, the World Bank\u2019s chief economist, said on current trends it would take China 10 years and India 75 years to have incomes per head of 25% of US levels. \u201cThe battle for global economic prosperity will largely be won or lost in middle-income countries,\u201d Gill said. \u201cBut too many of these countries rely on outmoded strategies to become advanced economies. They depend just on investment for too long \u2013 or they switch prematurely to innovation. \u201cA fresh approach is needed: first focus on investment; then add an emphasis on infusion of new technologies from abroad; and, finally, adopt a three-pronged strategy that balances investment, infusion, and innovation. With growing demographic, ecological and geopolitical pressures, there is no room for error.\u201d According to the World Bank, 108 countries were classified as middle-income at the end of 2023, each with annual incomes per head in the range of $1,136 to $13,845. Middle-income countries were home to 6 billion people \u2013 75% of the global population \u2013 with two out of every three people living in extreme poverty. They generated more than 40% of global gross domestic product, were the source of more than 60% of carbon emissions and faced far bigger challenges than their predecessors in escaping the middle-income trap: rapidly ageing populations, rising protectionism in advanced economies, and the need to speed up the energy transition. Gill said it would be tough for countries to break out of the middle-income trap. \u201cWe are not naive enough to think this will be easy. Middle-income countries will have to work miracles \u2013 not only to lift themselves up to high-income status but also to shift away from carbon-intensive growth paths that will lead to environmental ruin.\u201d The Bank proposed a \u201c3i strategy\u201d for countries depending on their stage of development. Low-income countries could focus solely on policies designed to increase investment \u2013 the 1i phase. Once they reached lower-middle-income status, they needed to shift gears and expand the policy mix in the 2i phase: investment and infusion, which involved adopting technologies from abroad and spreading them across the economy. At the upper-middle-income level, countries should shift gears again to the final 3i phase: investment, infusion, and innovation."

            "title": "London City airport expansion given green light by ministers",
            "date": "2024-08-19T16:48:31Z",
            "content": "Ministers have approved London City airport\u2019s application to expand, in a decision that has disappointed climate campaigners. The airport submitted a proposal to increase capacity from 6.5 million to 9 million passengers a year by putting on more weekend and early morning flights. Local campaigners and Newham council opposed the move, arguing the air and noise pollution would affect people living nearby and that it could potentially increase carbon emissions. Angela Rayner, the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, and Louise Haigh, the transport secretary, announced their decision on Monday. It said there was unlikely to be harm from any extra noise pollution caused by additional morning and weekend flights, and that it was right to respond to forecasted growth in demand of flights. It also said the decision to expand the airport was \u201cin line with national policy\u201d on the climate crisis. However, although the government accepted the higher passenger cap of 9 million, it rejected the airport\u2019s proposals to extend its Saturday afternoon operating hours to 6.30pm. The airport currently closes at 12.30pm on Saturdays. Analysis published by the Guardian last week found that more than half of the journeys taken from the airport last year could be done in six hours or less by train. The Climate Change Committee has recommended there should be no net airport expansion in the UK if the country is going to meet its legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050. Many English airports are seeking to expand. Gatwick, Heathrow, Luton and Stansted are all pushing to increase passenger capacity via new runways or terminal expansions. The Labour government has taken a soft stance so far and signalled an \u201copen-minded\u201d approach to Heathrow\u2019s proposed new runway. Alethea Warrington, a senior campaigner at the climate charity Possible, said: \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly disappointing that the new government has \u2026 allowed the expansion of this polluting, high-carbon project. \u201cLondon City airport\u2019s expansion will benefit only the private jet users who fly into the airport, at the expense of more air pollution for Londoners and more emissions that harm our climate. \u201cThe new minister for transport must explain why the government has ignored the clear scientific consensus on constraining aviation emissions \u2013 along with the advice of their own scientific advisers, the Climate Change Committee, which recommended no increase in the UK\u2019s airport capacity \u2013 in favour of allowing more planes and more pollution.\u201d Johann Beckford, a senior policy adviser at the Green Alliance thinktank, said: \u201cThis is a disappointing decision given the new government promised it would prioritise tackling climate change. \u201cThe decision sets a worrying precedent for planning applications at Luton and Gatwick airports due later this year. The government cannot jeopardise net zero ambitions and the health of local communities for the sake of airport and airline profits.\u201d Alison FitzGerald, London City airport\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWhile we welcome the approval to increase our passenger numbers, we are disappointed with the government\u2019s decision to reject our proposal to fly from 12.30pm to 6.30pm on Saturday afternoons. \u201cAs the government has recognised in its decision, rejecting our request to extend our Saturday afternoon operating hours will slow down airlines bringing cleaner, quieter next-generation aircraft to the airport. Local residents would have had the added benefit of these aircraft operating at the airport throughout the week, not just in the extended operating hours.\u201d The Department for Transport has been contacted for comment."

            "content": "McDonald\u2019s is to open more than 200 restaurants across the UK and Ireland over the next four years, creating about 24,000 new jobs as it steps up expansion amid a rise in demand for takeaways. The plan marks the US company\u2019s largest expansion programme in the UK for more than 20 years and is backed by a \u00a31bn investment by the fast food chain and its franchisees with a focus on high street locations. McDonald\u2019s, which this year celebrates 50 years since it opened its first UK store in Woolwich, south London, has 1,435 restaurants across the country, with about four-fifths owned and operated by franchisees who employ more than 170,000 workers. The planned outlets will include tests for new formats including smaller sites and \u201cdrive to\u201d restaurants. The UK food-to-go market is expected to expand by 40% in terms of value by 2028, according to the grocery industry body IGD. In recent years, growth has been driven by inflation but the amount being ordered began increasing again in 2024. That trend is expected to continue and become the key driver of performance from next year. The UK and Ireland expansion plans were announced after McDonald\u2019s revealed a target of building 10,000 more restaurants globally by 2027. However, in February the global business reported its first quarterly sales miss in nearly four years after being squeezed by weak sales growth in its business division that included the Middle East, China and India. Alistair Macrow, the chief executive officer of McDonald\u2019s UK and Ireland, said: \u201cWe have come a long way since we first opened our doors in Woolwich 50 years ago. \u201cI\u2019m delighted that in this milestone year we are able to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to growth, and announce the creation of new jobs across the country as we plan to open over 200 new restaurants over the next four years.\u201d Strong demand for takeaways continues, driven by a return to office working and those based at home treating themselves. However, there is heavy competition in the UK, with McDonald\u2019s losing the top spot for takeaway breakfast earlier this year to the Newcastle-based bakery chain Greggs, which continues to expand rapidly. Chris Kempczinski, the chief executive of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, said that globally it was \u201cclear that our value leadership\u2019 has recently shrunk\u201d. He pledged the company was \u201cworking to fix that with pace\u201d."

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) intends to launch a market study into pure protection products, which are designed to help individuals and their families with their finances should a policyholder die or be unable to cover financial commitments, after becoming concerned about how such policies are being sold. About \u00a34bn was paid out in claims in 2022, according to the FCA.

            "content": "The UK housing market is at its strongest since the aftermath of Liz Truss\u2019s infamous mini-budget that sent borrowing costs soaring, according to the latest figures. Nationwide said house prices grew at an annual rate of 2.4% in August, up from 2.1% in July and the fastest rate since December 2022. Separate figures from the Bank of England showed there were nearly 62,000 mortgages approved for homebuyers in July, the highest total since September 2022 \u2013 the same month as the former prime minister\u2019s disastrous mini-budget. The Bank also revised mortgage approval figures for June slightly upwards. The UK housing market has been buoyed up by the Bank\u2019s move this month to reduce rates from 5.25% to 5%, the first cut in four and a half years. Lenders have responded to the cut by introducing more competitive mortgage rates while Lloyds Bank, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage provider, announced on Thursday it would increase the maximum sum it was willing to lend to first-time buyers. Under the \u00a32bn initiative, which experts say will bring home ownership within the reach of more prospective buyers, the Lloyds and Halifax chains will allow new buyers to take out loans worth up to 5.5 times their household annual income \u2013 up from 4.49 times. \u201cSummer may be coming to an end but there\u2019s certainly no end in sight when it comes to the improvements being seen across the UK property market,\u201d said Marc von Grundherr, a director at the estate agent Benham and Reeves. \u201cIt\u2019s quite remarkable just how swiftly the market has accelerated in just a few short months.\u201d Von Grundherr said he believed Labour\u2019s warning of a \u201cpainful\u201d October budget and a potential worsening of economic conditions in the short term would not slow the burgeoning recovery in the housing market. \u201cThis is unlikely to derail the ambitions of the UK\u2019s buyers and sellers, who are now making their move with confidence following a prolonged period of market uncertainty,\u201d he said. Earlier this month the mortgage lender Halifax forecast that UK house prices would continue to grow throughout the rest of this year, as mortgage rates began to drop after the cut in interest rates. Nationwide said the average house price in the UK was \u00a3265,375 in August, down 0.2% on the previous month. The month-on-month drop is the first since April, reversing monthly increases of between 0.2% and 0.4%, although the price of an average UK house remains at its highest level since October 2022. \u201cWhile house price growth and activity remains subdued by historic standards, they nevertheless present a picture of resilience in the context of the higher interest rate environment, and where house prices remain high relative to average earnings \u2013 which makes raising a deposit more challenging,\u201d said Robert Gardner, the chief economist at Nationwide. Verona Frankish, the chief executive of the online property seller Yopa, said the new figures provided a first look at house price performance since interest rates were cut at the start of August. \u201cDespite the very marginal monthly decline, it\u2019s clear that the first reduction in four months has helped to further boost the market momentum, with yet another strong rate of annual house price growth being seen,\u201d she said. Frankish said that while rates remained \u201cconsiderably higher\u201d than buyers and sellers were used to, the expectation of the Bank of England making another cut this year \u201cshould only help to strengthen buyer appetites further\u201d."

            "date": "2024-08-19T14:51:07Z",
            "content": "Russia has complained to Germany about its investigation into the 2022 sabotage of the multibillion-dollar Nord Stream gas pipelines that run between the two countries, accusing Europe\u2019s top economic power of having little interest in finding those responsible. The head of a European department at the foreign ministry, Oleg Tyapkin, said Russia had \u201craised the issue of Germany and other affected countries fulfilling their obligations under the UN anti-terrorist conventions\u201d, RIA news agency reported in remarks cited by Reuters. \u201cWe have officially made corresponding claims on this matter bilaterally, including to Berlin,\u201d Tyapkin said. The criticism came after it was reported last week that German prosecutors had issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian diving instructor as a prime suspect. Polish prosecutors said they had received the warrant against the suspect identified as Volodymyr Z, but that he was able to slip across the Ukrainian border in early July because Germany had failed to include him in a shared wanted persons database. Volodymyr Z, who lived in Poland, is alleged to have dived 80 metres down to the seabed to place the explosive devices. At the time of the blasts, seven months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the pipelines were not in operation but contained gas. German media have identified two other suspects, also Ukrainian diving instructors \u2013 a man and a woman \u2013 but no further arrest warrants have been issued. Prosecutors and the German government have declined to comment on the investigation. Tyapkin was quoted as saying that Moscow believes German authorities will close the investigation prematurely, before identifying those behind the sabotage operation, which embarrassed Berlin. A German foreign ministry spokesperson, Sebastian Fischer, dismissed Tyapkin\u2019s claims and said German prosecutors were \u201cin contact with Russian authorities\u201d and that the investigation was still in progress. \u201cWe exchange the information that we can without endangering the investigation,\u201d he told reporters. The Nord Stream project, which carried natural gas under the Baltic Sea, was made unusable by a series underwater blasts for which no one has claimed responsibility. Western countries have accused Russia for explosions; Russia has blamed the US, Britain and Ukraine. US media in recent months reported that Ukraine was behind the attack, a charge Kyiv has repeatedly denied. Berlin\u2019s allies had long criticised Nord Stream for deepening German energy reliance on Russia, even after it annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014. Over the weekend Poland\u2019s prime minister, Donald Tusk, angrily hit back at German allegations that Warsaw may have abetted the sabotage, saying German officials had no standing to point the finger. \u201cTo all the initiators and patrons of Nord Stream 1 and 2. The only thing you should do today about it is apologise and keep quiet.\u201d Tusk wrote on X. He appeared to be responding to comments by Germany\u2019s former foreign intelligence chief August Hanning, who said that the attack on the pipelines must have had Warsaw\u2019s backing. Hanning, who served when Gerhard Schr\u00f6der was chancellor and later became a Gazprom lobbyist and close friend of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, told Die Welt last week that Germany should consider seeking damages from Poland and Ukraine. Before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, about a quarter of Germany\u2019s energy supply relied on gas, of which half was provided by Russia. Russian gas had later been seen as a key \u201cbridge\u201d in German energy strategy as it halted nuclear power and transitioned to renewables. Days before Moscow\u2019s attack on its neighbour, Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, announced that Berlin was stopping the certification process for Nord Stream 2, which was approved under his predecessor, Angela Merkel. In the ensuing months, Russia throttled gas supplies via Nord Stream 1, citing necessary repairs, which deepened a German energy crisis, sent inflation soaring and slashed economic growth. Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Nord Stream sabotage was carried out by a small Ukrainian team in an operation that was initially approved by Volodymyr Zelenskiy and then called off, but which went ahead anyway. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian president denied the claims. German police and prosecutors are reportedly focusing their investigation on senior Ukrainian military officials, which would raise awkward questions for Berlin, Europe\u2019s top supplier of arms to Ukraine as it seeks to fend off the Russian invasion. Senior German officials have continued to advance the theory that the sabotage was a Russian \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation designed to drive a wedge between the west and Kyiv. Denmark and Sweden dropped separate criminal inquiries in February without identifying a suspect."

            "title": "Industry acts to head off regulation on PFAS pollution from semiconductors",
            "date": "2024-08-24T13:00:33Z",
            "content": "Producers of PFAS chemicals and semiconductors, a key part of most electronics, have formed a group that develops industry-friendly science aimed at heading off regulation as facilities release high levels of toxic waste, documents seen by the Guardian show. The group, called the PFAS Consortium, was formed during a boom in domestic semiconductor production spurred by the Chips and Science Act that has led to $825bn in investment aimed at shoring up the industry. Left unchecked, however, the boom could also generate huge levels of toxic waste, experts fear. The semiconductor industry is a prolific polluter and a major source of unregulated and unmonitored toxic PFAS, or \u201cforever chemicals\u201d, some of which also turn into potent greenhouse gas. \u201cHardly anyone has been paying attention to the toxic waste from the industry as it grows at an enormous rate,\u201d said Lenny Siegel, a member of Chips Communities United, a group working with industry and administration officials to try to put in place environmental safeguards. \u201cNext time you do a Google search or chat, you\u2019re using chips \u2026 that were produced in a way that released PFAS in an environment irreversibly.\u201d Testing data from 2022 from one US production plant, or \u201cfab\u201d, seen by the Guardian showed as much as 78,000 parts per trillion (ppt) of PFAS in wastewater from some samples. The EPA legal limit for several common compounds is 4ppt. Public health advocates are increasingly sounding the alarm and calling for simple protections to curb semiconductor PFAS waste while pushing the industry to find safer alternatives, but manufacturers have mobilized in response. The PFAS Consortium\u2019s white papers circulated among policymakers make a case against regulations. In a document titled \u201cImpact of a potential PFAS restriction\u201d, the consortium acknowledges its PFAS pollution, but repeatedly stresses that there are very few regulations and opposes proposals to monitor or restrict waste. Finding safer alternatives is \u201cimpossible in some instances\u201d, the paper states, adding that finding alternatives would require \u201cstepping back decades in technological advancement\u201d. It touts industry efforts to cut back on waste, stating that the industry would continue to voluntarily reduce pollution \u201cif exemptions [to regulation] are granted\u201d. That seems to have caught lawmakers\u2019 attention: a bipartisan amendment in the defense bill that is likely to be approved would exempt new semiconductor manufacturing projects from environmental review \u2013 legislation on which federal records show lobbying by the Semiconductor Industry Association trade group, which organized the PFAS Consortium. In a statement, Laurie Beu, a director of the PFAS Consortium, said it \u201cis a purely technical effort comprised of industry experts around the world and dedicated to collecting the data needed to formulate an industry approach to PFAS based on science\u201d. The Chips Act is at odds with the Biden administration\u2019s 2021 sweeping plan to rein in PFAS pollution, and policymakers were largely ignoring the public health consequences, Siegel said. However, a group of US senators, including Ed Markey of Massachusetts, recently urged the commerce department to impose stricter regulations on chip producers. \u201cThe public provided over $50bn in investment in this industry and they should be able to reasonably expect they won\u2019t in turn be exposed to toxic chemicals \u2026 or breathe polluted air,\u201d Markey said. PFAS are a class of about 15,000 chemicals often used to make products resistant to water, stains and heat. They are called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally break down, and are linked to cancer, liver problems, thyroid issues, birth defects, kidney disease, decreased immunity and other serious health problems. Producing semiconductors is a highly complex process and PFAS are essential ingredients used in as many as 1,000 steps at the nanometric level, industry documents state, including photolithography and plasma processing. Production plants are notorious for contaminating nearby drinking water and air with an array of dangerous toxins like TCE, arsenic and chloroform. Silicon Valley is the nation\u2019s Superfund capital in large part because of the industry\u2019s toxic messes, and when public pressure prompted the tech companies to open plants abroad, their operations sickened employees in those countries. \u201cIt\u2019s not just PFAS \u2013 this is a very dirty business,\u201d said Arlene Blum, head of the Green Science Policy Institute, a public health advocacy group. Still, the amendment to the defense bill authored by the Democratic senator Mark Kelly would kill the environmental review of semiconductor production projects in which companies are required to disclose the types and quantities of pollution from their proposed facilities. Environmental groups use the review as an opportunity to push for the commerce department to require monitoring and treatment of PFAS wastewater, which is not currently required by law. \u201cIt seems like a really bad idea to exempt these plants from regulation,\u201d Blum added. \u2018It\u2019s a hard challenge\u2019 The chipmaking process emits PFAS into the water and air. Industry uses fluorinated gases, or PFAS gas, in a range of processes, and the toxicological risks of the gases are largely unknown. Their climate consequences, however, are clear \u2013 once in the atmosphere, the fluorinated gas can turn into TFA, a greenhouse gas with a lifespan of more than 1,000 years. Researchers in recent years have been alarmed by the ever-growing level of TFA in the air, water, human blood and elsewhere in the environment. Though industry captures some fluorinated gas, it cannot be destroyed. Sometimes manufacturers attempt to incinerate or destroy the chemicals thermally, but that often fails to fully eliminate the compounds and can create dangerous byproducts. \u201cIt is a hard challenge because they are using so many different kinds of PFAS,\u201d said Ariana Spentzos, science and policy associate with Green Science Policy Institute. \u201cIndustry says \u2018Incinerate it and it\u2019ll be fine,\u2019 but it turns out \u2026 you\u2019re just emitting different PFAS.\u201d As with other industries, chipmakers have switched from using PFOA and PFOS, two of the most toxic PFAS compounds, to using smaller (\u201cshort-chain\u201d) replacement chemicals. The PFAS Consortium touts the switch in its white papers as evidence of its environmental stewardship, but studies increasingly show replacement PFAS chemicals are also dangerous. PFBS, a common replacement compound found in industry wastewater, is comparatively less toxic, but still more toxic than most other regulated substances, Siegel noted. Some chipmakers ship captured PFAS to hazardous waste facilities. But deep-well-injection facilities are prone to leaking, while other shipments end up at incinerators that simply send the chemicals into the surrounding environment. That\u2019s why public health advocates are pushing for alternatives to PFAS instead of waste management, Siegel said. \u201cThey want to ship PFAS to a permitted treatment facility, but the way I interpret that, in the absence of more data, is they\u2019re going to send it to a community of color to be incinerated and that is likely to create toxic byproducts,\u201d he added. Chipmakers lobby Congress to kill regulations Chipmakers with the PFAS Consortium are largely part of the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group that does legislative and regulatory battle for the producers. Chipmaker TSMC, a Taiwanese multinational, has paid about $160,000 for an annual membership to the trade group and $50,000 annually to be a part of the consortium, documents show. Federal election records detail how the Semiconductor Industry Association, armed with its PFAS Consortium science highlighting the industry\u2019s case for avoiding PFAS regulation, spent about $1.5m lobbying Congress and the Biden administration last year. It is on pace to far exceed that figure this year, and that includes lobbying for the defense bill that would kill environmental reviews. \u201cThe consortium lobbies very strongly against those measures,\u201d Siegel said. Though industry is working to find alternatives, \u201cthey are trying to figure out what they can do without disrupting their production\u201d, he added. The consortium\u2019s Beu said in a statement that it cannot speak to individual members\u2019 lobbying. \u201cWe remain focused on providing the tools needed to support industry commitments to track and reduce PFAS, the availability of alternatives, and the development of further abatement technologies,\u201d she said. The consortium also claims in its white papers that it will take years or decades to remove PFAS from some parts of its production process, and that it may be impossible to remove some of the chemicals. That may be, \u201cbut they don\u2019t get to wash their hands of the issues\u201d and should increase research and development into alternatives, said Spentzos. She pointed to the University of Massachusetts working with the hi-tech materials manufacturer Transene in 2022 to quickly and successfully develop an alternative to PFAS in the semiconductor etching process. \u201cThey really do have to innovate and make safer alternatives for PFAS \u2026 but this is a great example of that taking a lot less time than they expected,\u201d Spentzos said. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 August 2024. Laurie Beu is a director of the PFAS Consortium, not the Semiconductor Industry Association."

            "date": "2024-08-27T22:41:44Z",
            "content": "Jannik Sinner returned to competition for his first match since his anti\u2011doping case was made public and he recovered from an early scare to defeat Mackenzie McDonald 2-6, 6-2, 6-1, 6-2 and reach the second round of the US Open. Sinner struggled badly early on against McDonald, who is ranked No 140 and has been out of form this year, trailing by a set and a break at 2-6, 0-1. Just as the match seemed to be moving away from him, he began to turn it around. After striking 14 unforced errors in the opening set alone, Sinner finished the final three sets with just 15 unforced errors in total. Last week, the International Tennis Integrity Agency revealed that the men\u2019s world No 1 had failed two anti-doping tests in March before an independent tribunal had ruled that Sinner bore no fault or negligence for the positive tests. Sinner argued successfully that the positive tests had been a result of contamination after his physio had treated a cut on his finger with an over-the-counter spray containing the banned substance clostebol before massaging Sinner during their daily treatment. Since the news was released, Sinner has received a positive reception from crowds in New York and it was a similar case on Tuesday in front of a sparse, understated crowd on Arthur Ashe Stadium. \u201cI started a little bit not in the best way, but for sure, the first matches in the biggest tournaments are not easy,\u201d Sinner said. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to be in the next round, first time to win on this court after some attempts.\u201d Naomi Osaka, meanwhile, began her tournament with the biggest result of her comeback since giving birth as she defeated Jelena Ostapenko, the 10th seed, 6-3, 6-2 to reach the second round in New York. Having been handed a difficult draw against Ostapenko, the 2017 French Open champion, Osaka rose to the occasion and played a brilliant match. She backed up her elite serving with clean, relentless ball striking to clinch a first top\u201110 win since January 2020. After sitting back down in her chair, the 26-year-old cried into her towel. \u201cIt\u2019s been so much hard work, so much, like, dreams and wishes, and I hope that I can continue. As of right now, I am really happy with how I played,\u201d Osaka said. Iga Swiatek, the No 1 seed, reached the second round with a tough 6-4, 7-6(6) win against Kamilla Rakhimova after saving three set points from 3-6 down in the second\u2011set tiebreak. Danielle Collins, meanwhile, refused a retirement presentation after her 1-6, 7-5, 6-4 first\u2011round defeat against her compatriot Caroline Dolehide. To commemorate Collins\u2019s final grand slam match before her retirement at the end of the season, Stacey Allaster, the US Open tournament director, stood by the court entrance with a bouquet of flowers but the 11th seed opted to make a quick exit. \u201cI had requested not to have any presentation on the court,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI\u2019m not somebody that likes to celebrate my accomplishments. I\u2019ve struggled with feeling guilt around success, and that\u2019s something I have had to work on. So I\u2019m not great, honestly, at having an all\u2011about-me moment. \u201cI just would prefer to do something like that maybe in private, you know. But I feel like I\u2019ve gotten enough attention to last a lifetime. \u201cI was kind of thinking of that movie, I think it was Meet the Parents or Meet the Fockers, where, you know, Gaylord has a shrine and all his 18th-place medals.

This is essential to restore economic stability and deliver our national mission for growth.\u201d About \u00a3300m in funding for the AI Research Resource has already been distributed and continues as planned. However, the shadow science secretary, Andrew Griffith, said when the election was called, ministers had been advised by officials that the department was likely to underspend its budget for the current financial year. He added: \u201cThis is a terrible blow to the UK tech sector and could be just the start of Labour cuts. During the election, Labour refused to commit to growing the amount the UK spends on research, yet that\u2019s a core part of growing a modern economy. If DSIT can\u2019t get the funds from the Treasury, this means university research can expect to be hit, too.\u201d Last week, the science secretary, Peter Kyle, said he was \u201cputting AI at the heart of the government\u2019s agenda to boost growth and improve our public services\u201d, and appointed the tech entrepreneur Matt Clifford to draw up an action plan to identify new AI opportunities. The plan will look at the necessary infrastructure, talent and data access required to drive AI adoption by the public and private sectors. The funding decisions mean that the future of the Edinburgh exascale supercomputer is unclear. The University of Edinburgh said its principal and vice-chancellor, Prof Sir Peter Mathieson, was urgently seeking a meeting with the science secretary. The UK\u2019s first next-generation supercomputer \u2013 50 times faster than any of the existing machines \u2013 was to be hosted at the university, able to perform 1 billion billion calculations each second. The university hosts the country\u2019s current national supercomputer, Archer2, and has already spent \u00a331m on the building planned to house the exascale. The university says on its website: \u201cExascale will help researchers model all aspects of the world, test scientific theories and improve products and services in areas such as artificial intelligence, drug discovery, climate change, astrophysics and advanced engineering.\u201d A university spokesperson said: \u201cThe University of Edinburgh has led the way in supercomputing within the UK for decades, and is ready to work with the government to support the next phase of this technology in the UK, in order to unlock its benefits for industry, public services and society.\u201d The trade body techUK urged the government to come up with replacement proposals for the supercomputer. \u201cThe UK had sent clear signals about its ambitions to host a new generation of computers to enable cutting-edge research, including in AI,\u201d said Sue Daley, the director of technology and innovation at techUK. \u201cIn an extremely competitive global environment, the government needs to come forward with new proposals quickly. Otherwise, we will lose out against our peers.\u201d The government has launched an action plan to identify how AI can drive economic growth and is expected to launch a consultation on a bill, focused on the most advanced models, soon. Dame Wendy Hall, a professor of computer science at the University of Southampton and a member of the UN\u2019s advisory body on AI, said the government must develop a new, more comprehensive AI strategy. \u201cClearly the government is recalibrating its spending plans. I understand that because of wider constraints and the fact that this government will want to develop its own approach to AI,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need a wider, more inclusive AI strategy to emerge, one that doesn\u2019t just focus on safety and advanced models. I hope that will come from the action plan and the consultation on an AI bill.\u201d"

            "content": "Lately, I\u2019ve been lying awake in the small hours, hypnotised by watch repair videos \u2013 pinions, train wheel bridges, pallet forks, barrel arbors, the literal works. Am I interested in watches? No. I could only become less interested in horology by slipping into a coma. My wristwatch hasn\u2019t worked in months, and I may never want to know what time it is again \u2013 standardised timekeeping just makes people expect things of me and I don\u2019t feel I can currently deliver. I just want to stay quiet and peaceful while people with teeny screwdrivers talk about amplitudes and restore components smaller than the light in a robin\u2019s eye. This is what the 21st century has made of me. I am not a watch person. I already had my own interests: I\u2019m meant to lie awake reading novels, checking on current affairs, bingeing Korean vampire-medical-action-romcom series. (Lordy, Korean vampires are attractive.) Watches? In a reasonable world, I wouldn\u2019t care if you told me your crown gasket was rotten or your balance staff awry. In a reasonable world I wouldn\u2019t know what the Patek Philippe you were talking about. But this is the world where the internet isn\u2019t binding us together in knowledge and strength \u2013 it\u2019s drowning us in the monetised nightmares of a) a child\u2019s drawing of a haunted candle b) a fascistic South African goblin. Wealth addicts farm us for anxiety clicks and radicalise us as race war foot soldiers. Exquisite computer programming, based on top-grade research, helping rid humanity of work and woe? Nope. We get Shit AI. We didn\u2019t want it any more than we wanted Clippy, but here it is, scraping data everywhere all at once, turning the rich tapestry of human achievement into a slurry of plagiarism, racial bias and porn, then serving it up in disturbing beige nuggets. And if I need to write an email, I don\u2019t want AI to \u201chelp\u201d make me sound like a cursed mannequin pretending to be an intern, I want to sound like me. In a reasonable world the power to save our planet or boil it away into radioactive misery and blood dust wouldn\u2019t rest in the hands of a Botoxed Russian mobster with a tracksuit fetish, or a Winnie-the-Pooh lookalike who\u2019s into mass incarceration and maybe organ harvesting. At least the malignant narcissist Hannibal Lecter fan unable to remember which women he has sexually assaulted probably won\u2019t get near the nuclear football again. But why was that even a possibility? The great unravelling of Trump is the culmination of so many bad choices. America\u2019s still-fascinated media is watching Donnie come apart like shit in a Jacuzzi, never admitting they helped make him, just as our media amplified Nigel \u201cdon\u2019t blame the riots on me\u201d Farage. Nige is still on the Trump train, rather than the Clacton one. Liz Truss is courting Trump\u2019s base, too. Bless. There\u2019s a lot of frankly disturbing wishful thinking about populism and wishes can lead anyone astray, even as the Maga doorway to fame and fortune drops off its hinges. Lizzie and Nigel expressed legitimate concerns about immigration \u2013 don\u2019t mention racism \u2013 and rose. As influencers distanced themselves from rioters who burned down a library to prove the supremacy of western culture, Truss\u2019s immaculate sense of timing kicked in and she started boosting free speech as the right to say appalling and radicalising things without consequences. Is she aiming to be another Rosa Parks \u2013 but for people who might loot Greggs? Failing that, would photo opportunities involving Jimmy Choos and a burning wheelie bin suffice? A gig\u2019s a gig. Doggedly elevate wealth over sanity, profit over compassion, balance facts with lunacy, and you get Trump, Trussonomics, Musk, and more reclusive, darker disruptors, such as Peter Thiel and Mike Flynn. Disruptors make money by treating reality like a snow globe \u2013 shake, shake, shake \u2013 until people break. But even obscene wealth can\u2019t overwhelm reality. Eventually, reality always overcomes illusion, but the damage disruption has caused remains. Run enough contrarian thought experiments, suppress all oversight, muffle education, release enough psycho-engineered scare stories, overheat every opinion, and you\u2019ll reach the point where everything has to be relitigated \u2013 whether women should speak, whether all people are people, whether starving is a bad thing, whether death is an inevitable byproduct of business and diplomacy, whether dying of preventable diseases is a big deal, whether dying of cold in your own home is\u2026 To summarise, the right\u2019s thought experiments are always about death \u2013 yours and mine. Prison camps, slavery, torture, nazism, civil war, witch burning, blood libel \u2013 there isn\u2019t a filthy idea the 21st century\u2019s public discourse and information overlords haven\u2019t picked at, or swallowed whole. And why do so many wannabe populist demagogues sound like Pennywise having mouth sex with a satnav? Do they think we\u2019ll find that persuasive? I prefer the watchmakers, the quiet, ordinary voices describing centuries of determined improvement in form and function, a striving for reliability, precision, usefulness. Centuries of improvement are what make the world reasonable. Let me see skilled people treat broken but profoundly useful mechanisms with patient understanding, delicacy and respect \u2013 let me see that expertise, tenderness and humility matter. And when I\u2019m tired of people who target beauty and steal joy, let me see a watch case open to show me unanticipated beauties, set there like a happy secret for the sake of functionality, joy in creativity, and the dignity of a craftsperson offering their best to strangers. There are ways of being in the world that welcome the stranger. We\u2019re all the stranger sometimes. And sometimes we\u2019re the people with skills, who know how to make and mend, how to be friends, how to be neighbours. When the world shakes, we need neighbours \u2013 all our neighbours. I like the feeling I get when a balance wheel spins again after lost years, breakages, deaths, abandonment. I like believing that determined people who understand the practical applications of love may always be able to restore at least some of what\u2019s broken.

            "date": "2024-08-09T07:55:21Z",
            "content": "Hargreaves Lansdown has agreed a \u00a35.4bn takeover by private equity suitors that will give hundreds of millions of pounds to its billionaire founders and result in the investment supermarket becoming the latest company to leave the London stock market. Board members of the FTSE 100 company recommended the \u00a311.40-a-share offer, which requires shareholder approval. The announcement comes almost four months after Hargreaves was first approached with a \u00a39.85-a-share offer by the consortium involving the buyout firm CVC Capital Partners, the group behind the Six Nations tournament and England\u2019s Premiership Rugby. The initial offer was rejected, leading to further discussions over the summer. Talks have been extended twice since, and Friday was the final deadline for the consortium to make an offer. The buyers are CVC, Sweden\u2019s Nordic Capital, and a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. The deal will result in a windfall for its billionaire founders, Peter Hargreaves and Stephen Lansdown, who still hold stakes worth almost 20% and 5.7% respectively. However, shareholders have the option of either taking a payout or rolling their shares over into the private business. The announcement on Friday confirmed that Hargreaves would take only 50% of his shares into the new venture, resulting in an expected \u00a3535m payout. Lansdown will sell all of his shares for \u00a3308m. Advisers on the deal, which include Fenchurch, Barclays, and Morgan Stanley, are also in line for lucrative fees. The company has about 1.9 million clients and \u00a3155.3bn in assets under management. The takeover is the latest blow to the London Stock Exchange, as Hargreaves joins a growing list of companies exiting the FTSE 100 index to private takeovers and rival financial hubs. In May, the owner of Paddy Power, Flutter, announced it would switch its primary listing to New York, while the UK chip designer Arm opted to list on Wall Street last August after the government failed to persuade it to float in London. The Anglo-German tourism company Tui voted to move its main listing from London to Frankfurt earlierthis year. Hargreaves has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since 2007. However, shares in the 43-year-old firm, which has 2,400 staff, have floundered in recent years, amid concerns over rising costs and risks related to a significant overhaul and tech investment plan. The Hargreaves Lansdown chair, Alison Platt, said while the board was pleased with the management team\u2019s progress, the cash offer was an attractive opportunity for shareholders \u201cto realise an immediate and certain cash value for their investment at a level which may not be achievable until the execution of the strategy is delivered\u201d. The private equity consortium said: \u201cWe are aligned with management that, despite these strengths, the company now requires substantial investment in an extensive technology-led transformation to improve Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s proposition and resilience, and to drive the next phase of HL\u2019s growth and development.\u201d The consortium said it would \u201caccelerate its transformation plan\u201d, investing in technology and improving its services."

            "date": "2024-08-21T04:00:50Z",
            "content": "Waitrose is planning to open 100 convenience stores over the next five years as part of a \u00a31bn-plus investment in new outlets and shop refurbishments. The upmarket grocery chain is planning to unveil a revamped outlet in Finchley Road, north London, on Wednesday. This will kick off a new phase of expansion with its first new store in six years in Hampton Hill, west London, by the end of this year. James Bailey, executive director of Waitrose, said the group planned over five years to open up to four large supermarkets as well as the Little Waitrose shops, some of which may include relocations from existing sites. He said older stores were also being refurbished to feature \u201cmore of what people expect from us and love such as counters, unequalled service and a lot more fresh food\u201d. Bailey said Waitrose was continuing to invest in technology to ensure there were no longer gaps on shelves after IT problems and a warehouse fire which led to stocking issues in 2022 and last year. Speaking ahead of the reopening of the Finchley Road store, which will have larger fresh meat and fish counters and a new out-of-hours pickup point for online shoppers, Bailey said: \u201cAt the moment we are on a real positive upward trajectory.\u201d The new openings come as Waitrose has begun to regain market share after a tough period in which it came under pressure amid heavy competition from its rival Marks &amp; Spencer and the cost of living crisis, in which shoppers sought out cheaper options. In the three months to 4 August Waitrose recorded its strongest growth since November 2023, according to data from analysts at Kantar. The uptick comes just ahead of the arrival of Jason Tarry, a veteran of Tesco, who next month will replace Sharon White as chair of Waitrose\u2019s parent group, the John Lewis Partnership. He is expected to oversee a return to prioritising retail at the group after White\u2019s strategy of diversification. His arrival comes after a period of turbulence under White, a high-flying former civil servant who had only recently begun to turn JLP\u2019s fortunes around after inheriting an overexpanded empire that delivered a series of punishing losses. The group announced a return to profit in March but opted not to restore its annual bonus for workers who jointly own the group. White also scrapped a target of moving towards 40% of JLP\u2019s profits coming from non-retail business by 2030 after criticism for too much focus on projects such as building homes to rent and expanding financial services, while the group\u2019s retail brands languished. Bailey said: \u201cThe transformation of our Finchley Road store marks the next evolution of our journey to create a great shopping experience for our customers, underpinned by a high-quality product offering tailored to the local area, and the quality service we are synonymous with. \u201cIn designing the store, we have taken time to understand how our customers like to shop, and used this knowledge to introduce new concepts that will be tested and rolled out nationally as we continue to work towards the Waitrose of the future.\u201d Innovations include a Hot Wok ready-to-eat meals counter, Crosstown doughnuts in the bakery section, a hatch to allow collections of fast-track online orders by the likes of Deliveroo outside the store\u2019s opening hours, and the first UK supermarket to have a dedicated internal space for click-and-collect online orders. The store will also house a dry aged beef cabinet and a dedicated parmesan section, reflecting local tastes which have made the Finchley Road store one of its biggest sellers of the Italian cheese, accounting for almost 15% of Waitrose parmesan sales."

            "date": "2024-08-18T07:00:22Z",
            "content": "There is an aura of assertiveness about Michele Kang, as she walks through the reception area of a central London hotel. It is there again in her handshake, then it is most prominent when she is soon calmly, yet enthusiastically, explaining her firm belief that investing in women\u2019s sports makes total business sense. She has already put her money where her mouth is. A couple of weeks ago, the owner of Washington Spirit in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, Lyon\u2019s women\u2019s team and London City Lionesses announced a $50m (\u00a339m) investment to improve female athletes\u2019 health. In the same week, after seeing the USA\u2019s women\u2019s rugby sevens team win Olympic bronze at a packed Stade de France, on the spur of the moment she pledged a further $4m in a bid to see them win gold in Los Angeles. \u201cYes, that was an expensive game for me,\u201d she says, jokingly but her tone is deadly serious when she says she is \u201cvery, very surprised\u201d that a lot more investors did not put their money in before her. \u201cI\u2019m on a mission to prove that women\u2019s sports is good business,\u201d says the South Korea-born Kang, whose Spirit host Arsenal Women in a pre-season friendly in the US capital on Sunday. \u201cThe gap between where it is and what it could be, is huge. I\u2019m flabbergasted that no one saw that. \u201cThis is not charity. Absolutely not. This is a serious investment. As a woman, I think it\u2019s almost insulting that these world-class athletes are being considered by some people as some sort of \u2018DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] project\u2019. No, I want to apply my business skills to solve these problems.\u201d To sit above the three women\u2019s football teams she owns, she has set up Kynisca Sports International Ltd, a multi-club ownership group, vowing that its new \u201cinnovation hub\u201d and centralised resources for research on specific female athletes\u2019 performance are a necessity for the women\u2019s game. The $50m pledge is a lot of cash but she points to the recent, rapid increase in sale prices for clubs in the NWSL, with valuations of between $2m and $5m a few years ago to Angel City\u2019s $250m valuation this year as a key indicator that women\u2019s sports will be profitable. \u201cThe growth has been exponential. This is not somebody\u2019s PowerPoint presentation. The proof is there.\u201d She had never attended a women\u2019s rugby game before seeing what she labelled as \u201cunbelievably engaged fans\u201d at that bronze medal match in Paris, nor had she attended any professional women\u2019s football matches until after the Covid pandemic. Women\u2019s sport was not, she says, originally part of her career plan. A keen tennis player in her youth, she moved to the US as a student and won awards for entrepreneurship and enjoyed lucrative success in the medical technology industry and venture capitalism, but now her motivations \u2013 as well as being financial \u2013 are based on a desire to improve things for young women. \u201cI\u2019m an immigrant and I was lucky enough to realise my American dream. So it\u2019s my turn to provide the opportunity,\u201d she says with passion. \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee an equal outcome, but I want to provide equal opportunity, and then the rest is up to you. I want more people, especially underprivileged, under\u2011resourced young people, to be able to achieve their dream. \u201cI\u2019ve seen incredibly talented young girls and women have to give up their dreams because there\u2019s no viable professional career path \u2013 too many girls drop out of sport right before college or when menstruation comes at 11, 12, so I want to provide an environment where young women can pursue their dreams without any constraints, just like the next-door boy would have.\u201d And when she says \u201ceveryone\u201d, she means in every corner of the globe. For now, her new multi-club ownership group is just three-teams strong, all in football, but asked if Kynisca might branch out into other women\u2019s sports she says \u201ceventually, probably\u201d, and then when asked how many football clubs around the world she wants to own, she says: \u201cI don\u2019t know [how many] but I definitely want to have one in each continent, and that\u2019s not about greed or vanity. I don\u2019t want girls around the world to watch on TV and say: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s just an English, French, American phenomenon.\u2019 I\u2019ll bring exactly the same thing everywhere so they can see it\u2019s in their backyard and within their reach. That\u2019s one of the major drivers for expanding globally.\u201d After buying into Spirit in 2020 and taking over in 2022, in May last year she acquired a majority stake in the eight-time Champions League winners Lyon. The third part of Kang\u2019s global expansion came last December, when she purchased the English second-tier side London City Lionesses. They were a bottom\u2011half club last term with rather modest turnouts, but Kang has snapped up Paris Saint\u2011Germain\u2019s head coach, Jocelyn Pr\u00eacheur, and signed a flurry of players including the Sweden veteran Kosovare Asllani. Kang has moved the team to Bromley for the new season and announced plans to build a \u201cworld-class\u201d dedicated training centre in Kent. Many outsiders may be asking, why choose the relatively unknown London City Lionesses? \u201cThe first and primary reason was, it\u2019s independent,\u201d says Kang, who has come straight from a meeting with the training ground architects. \u201cSpinning off a women\u2019s team that\u2019s part of a men\u2019s team is a very complicated deal. \u201cSecond, \u2018London\u2019, the fact that the name is \u2018London City\u2019, that\u2019s huge in my opinion, and in the London City area there\u2019s really no football presence there so it\u2019s really right for us to go in and take that as the future.\u201d Kang, who has said that her long-term target is to win the Women\u2019s Super League, knows larger broadcast deals will be key to the future profitability of the women\u2019s leagues, but concludes defiantly with an insight drawn from the Women\u2019s National Basketball Association. \u201cIf you look at men\u2019s sports, if you take the media money out, there aren\u2019t that many teams that are profitable,\u201d she says. \u201cNow look at the deal the WNBA just made. It\u2019s going to happen. The numbers are there for women\u2019s football, it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d"

            "content": "The largest English vineyards increased their revenues by 15% last year, as wine investors respond to the climate crisis by planting more vines. While the UK still languishes well down the list of the largest wine-producing nations, below countries such as Uzbekistan and Tunisia, the industry\u2019s output has soared in recent years, rising by 77% last year to 161,960 hectolitres, equivalent to 21.6m bottles. Analysis of Companies House filings for the seven largest vineyards shows that their turnover, led by Kent-based Chapel Down, rose from \u00a332m to \u00a337m last year, more than three times higher than the \u00a313m recorded in 2018-19. One of the drivers for growth has been the \u201cimproved growing conditions in the UK as a result of climate change,\u201d according to accountancy UHY Hacker Young, which reviewed the companies\u2019 accounts. But the flip side of rising global temperatures is the risk that grape production in more traditional wine-producing countries is under threat. \u201cSome of the investment in the UK by foreign wine producers is partly driven by their desire to diversify production away from areas where crop yields are being damaged by climate change,\u201d said UHY Hacker Young partner James Simmonds. \u201cNew investors with deeper pockets are providing new capital for vineyards and are allowing UK winemakers to fund new production,\u201d he added, pointing to vineyard tourism and on-site restaurants proving fertile terroirs for growth. The amount of wine grown in the UK \u2013 the vast majority of which is produced in England and referred to as \u201cEnglish wine\u201d \u2013 has increased significantly and has led to producers such as Chapel Down, Gusborne and Roebuck Estate winning acclaim on the world stage. South-eastern England is conducive to the production of sparkling wine in particular, due to the similarity of its topography to the Champagne region of France. But total output remains tiny in comparison with powerhouses such as France, Italy and Spain. France, the world leader, produced 48m hectolitres (mhl) in 2024, about a fifth of the global total and nearly 300 times the UK\u2019s output. However, the second- and third-placed wine-producing nations, Italy and Spain, witnessed a decline in production, with the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) highlighting climate effects such as drought and heavy rain. Of the OIV\u2019s list of 21 \u201cmajor\u201d producers, Switzerland ranks last, with 1 mhl of wine flowing from its vineyards in 2023, about six times UK output."

            "content": "The Labour government will invest \u201cunprecedented levels of funding\u201d in cycling and walking as a critical part of plans to improve health and inequality, the new secretary for transport has said. A national network of safe cycle routes could cut GP appointments \u201cby hundreds of thousands, if not millions a year\u201d by helping people incorporate more physical activity into their lives, according to Louise Haigh, who also sits on the government\u2019s health mission delivery board. She added that access to safe cycle routes was \u201cessential\u201d to tackling the country\u2019s carbon footprint. \u201cWe\u2019re in a climate crisis. We\u2019re in a public health crisis; getting people walking and cycling and moving more are essential to solving both of those in the immediate term and in the long term,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of evidence to show that will reduce the number of GP appointments by hundreds of thousands, if not millions, a year.\u201d Transport is the largest single contributor to the UK\u2019s carbon emissions, and while cycling wasn\u2019t specifically in the Labour manifesto, bar a reference to \u201cactive travel\u201d \u2013 a catchall term for walking, cycling and wheeling (as wheelchair and mobility aid users do) \u2013 Haigh says it will be \u201cutterly essential to developing our national integrated transport strategy\u201d. Almost three-quarters of trips in England are less than five miles. This strategy will include long-term funding settlements, which Haigh says will save money and improve the consistency of transport networks, particularly walking and cycling routes, including the National Cycle Network, which is run by the charity Sustrans. Historically, cycle routes, unlike roads and rail, have had little to no multi-year funding settlements, making strategic planning and delivery of cycle networks all but impossible, and leaving substantial gaps in the quality and coverage of routes. A bidding system involving tens of different funding pots (there are up to 45 different funds for active travel) has historically distributed cycling money unevenly across the country and \u201cpitted councils against each other\u201d. \u201cWe absolutely want to make sure that we invest at unprecedented levels,\u201d Haigh told the Guardian. \u201cWe just want to make sure that the funding is delivered where it\u2019s needed \u2026 rather than where they\u2019ve got the best bid writers, and where they\u2019ve been good at hoovering up resources.\u201d She said: \u201cCycle lanes and active travel work isn\u2019t properly joined up,\u201d adding that it was an \u201canomaly\u201d that the National Cycle Network was run by a charity while the government runs roads and rail. The last government introduced multi-year funding for cycling during the pandemic, only to cut it by more than half. These cuts, a Labour analysis estimated last year, would cost more than \u00a32bn in the long term, through their impact on health and the wider economy. Cycling and walking are considered to have very high returns for taxpayers\u2019 money, at \u00a35.62 for each \u00a31 spent \u2013 double the returns of roads. The decision resulted in a legal challenge from campaigners, which was ultimately rejected. Labour is due to announce the contents of an internal review of transport infrastructure projects. Asked about the \u00a316bn of trunk road projects, which have been called \u201clow value\u201d by campaigners, Haigh said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at all capital projects, and where that money should be best spent. In a world where there\u2019s not much money, we want to make sure it\u2019s spent \u2026 [to] get the best bang for our buck.\u201d Haigh, who is the MP for Sheffield Heeley, calls transport \u201ca liberator\u201d \u2013 one that helps other government departments achieve their aims, including education and health. \u201cIt has knock-on effects everywhere else: it gets people healthier, it reduces the burden on the NHS because people are living healthier lives for longer,\u201d she said. \u201cI am here to make sure that education can deliver those educational opportunities and make sure that people from all backgrounds can achieve no matter what postcode they\u2019re brought up in. [Transport is] \u2026 essential for delivering growth and obviously net zero and safer streets, safety on public transport networks, safety for women cycling down dark alleyways: they can\u2019t do any of it without transport.\u201d Cycling and walking are cost-effective means of travelling short distances, and an important way for people to get regular exercise. Research shows most people would like to cycle more: however, a lack of safe routes and a fear of sharing the roads with motor traffic puts cycling out of reach for most people, particularly women. Men in England make three times as many cycling trips as women. Haigh admits she has never cycled in London, but would like to try out the city\u2019s growing network of cycle lanes \u2013 although government ministers are given a car with a driver, partly for security reasons (famously David Cameron cycled in London while the driver shadowed him). She said: \u201cI\u2019ve not cycled in London. I don\u2019t know why, because it\u2019s obviously super flat. I definitely do want to get into it more, not least because I don\u2019t have time to get to the gym. So it\u2019s a really good alternative \u2026 I\u2019m afraid now I have my ministerial car, I don\u2019t know whether Dennis [her driver] would let me, he might have to drive alongside me or something ridiculous.\u201d Haigh also said the government would develop a new road safety strategy. Transport in Britain is devolved, and England\u2019s previous road safety strategy lapsed in 2019, leaving it the only country in the G7 without one. In 2023 an estimated 29,643 people were killed or seriously injured on Britain\u2019s roads. While three-quarters of traffic fatalities are men, fear of traffic danger affects women\u2019s transport choice disproportionately. Haigh said the government would use \u201cbehavioural science and analysis\u201d to understand and tackle some of those barriers. Improving and building cycle routes, along with measures to help people use those routes from childhood onwards, \u201ccan increase usage [of cycles] by hundreds and hundreds of per cents\u201d, she added. In one section of the Trans Pennine Trail in South Yorkshire there was a 700% increase in usage after it was resurfaced. Haigh added: \u201cRural poverty is a real blight, and it\u2019s not something that\u2019s really properly considered. Car ownership now is just so expensive, insurance as a young driver is completely out of reach for a lot of people. So having that access to safe cycle routes is a basic element, is a basic tenet of social justice\u201d. Xavier Brice, the chief executive of Sustrans, which runs the National Cycle Network, said the charity was \u201cready to work in partnership with the government, mayors and local councils\u201d to continue upgrading the network. \u201cSafe, accessible and consistent walking, wheeling and cycling routes will free people up to choose how they travel rather than feeling locked into expensive car use that many can\u2019t afford to access jobs, education or everyday journeys such as nipping to the shops,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 August 2024.

At last, a perceptive and forthright travel writer saying that most of us travel with the wrong ideas. I could not agree more with what she said. Colonialism is a good word for the attitude of some tourists. Yet, of course, travel is good and of huge benefit to poorer economies \u2013 as long as who and what we visit is not destroyed in the visiting. I travelled many times with Traidcraft, a fair trade company sadly recently deceased, on its Meet the People tours. We visited village artisans and farmers on every continent, who grew or made the products in their catalogue and who had benefited from a fair price, security and increased self\u2011confidence that are the hallmarks of fair trade. As a result, we were welcomed everywhere as VIPs (even though we weren\u2019t!) who had directly given them a better life for their community and, most especially, their children. It was a humbling privilege, as well as eye-opening, to share their lives for a short time. Though when they asked about our homes it was embarrassing to note the huge differences. Fair trade is a large part of the answer to our unequal world, and fair trade tourism follows from that. The Ethical Travel Guide was a well-thumbed volume for me, and I am sure there are more choices available now, of fair trade holidays that benefit people and protect our environment. Just look for them. Never was thoughtful and responsible travelling more needed, for our ravaged planet and its exploited inhabitants.

            "content": "Some journalists disparage summer as a dry, barren season, but this month has yielded a bumper crop of ancient cliches. Try union barons, militant strikers or Labour paymasters. That\u2019s right, Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s pay rise for junior doctors, train drivers and others has prompted many rightwing politicians and pundits to riffle through their Roget\u2019s stale-o-saurus. Rather than laugh them off, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has promised there will be \u201cno blank cheques\u201d (another old saw). But there will be more, so much more, of the anti\u2011worker language as the Trades Union Congress meets next month and Labour ministers enact their promised new deal, which will roll back some of the most egregious legislation against trade unions from David Cameron and Rishi Sunak. Rather than adjudicate each and every one of the pay claims, it is worth making two broad points about the role of trade unions and public sector workers in our country. First and most obviously, teachers, nurses and doctors \u2013 to name just a few of the professions to whom we entrust the bodies and minds of ourselves and our loved ones \u2013 saw their pay slashed in real terms under austerity. According to analysis from the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, a typical doctor\u2019s salary is worth 15% less today than it was in 2010, a teacher is 10% down. One result is that the UK now has a shortage of doctors and teachers. That shortage means cancelled operations and no appointments before Christmas. It means schools shelling out extra on supply staff or children missing maths and science lessons. It is a headache for patients, parents, headteachers, NHS managers and government ministers. And if the right aren\u2019t perturbed by any of that, they should at least acceptthat that shortage is also a market signal that these jobs and their terms and conditions are not up to standard. Given that energy bills are set to rise by an average of 10% this winter, that pressure to do something about public sector pay would only have built. As Ms Reeves rightly observed, there was \u201ca cost to not settling\u201d. Of course, there have been warnings about the dent to public finances \u2013 but there is also a financial and social cost to industrial action, to wasted intellectual potential and to time lost while workers are ill. Second, trade unions are an essential part of a modern economy. Those \u201cunion barons\u201d are elected and accountable to their members, in a way that no FTSE chief executive is really beholden to employees, suppliers or shareholders. And their members are ordinary workers (rather than \u201cdossers\u201d or \u201clead-swingers\u201d \u2013 more cliches) who, over the past four decades, have been stripped of many of their essential rights to organise and demonstrate. Evidence suggests that, just as with privatisation and outsourcing, the UK has gone further down this road than many other rich countries. Union weakness has also weakened capitalism, according to no less an authority than the International Monetary Fund. Straight after the banking crash of 2008-09, its economists published a study arguing that a big reason for the crash was that workers were being driven to borrow more. The IMF researchers\u2019 recommendation? A \u201crestoration of the lower income group\u2019s bargaining power\u201d. In other words, Sharon Graham and Mick Lynch are good for capitalism \u2013 the IMF says so. Now there\u2019s an uncliched thought."

            "date": "2024-08-23T05:00:26Z",
            "content": "Liverpool must not \u201cshy away\u201d from its historic involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, the organiser of the city\u2019s 25th Slavery Remembrance Day commemoration has said. Michelle Charters, who is leading Liverpool\u2019s events for Unesco\u2019s Slavery Remembrance Day, said it was important to address and recognise the city\u2019s tarnished history. \u201cI think there\u2019s absolutely tonnes of conversations that need to be had in terms of the impact we still feel from transatlantic slavery. We cannot hide from that and we cannot shy [away] from it,\u201d said Charters, who was appointed the head of the International Slavery Museum (ISM) in January. She added: \u201cWhat we have to do is address it. It\u2019s our history, it\u2019s the UK\u2019s history and instead of it being hidden, it needs to be recognised, remembered and reconciliation needs to happen.\u201d Liverpool, once known as the slave-trading capital of Britain, will mark the remembrance day on Friday, which coincides with the August 1791 uprising of enslaved people in Haiti (then Saint-Domingue, a French colony). The international event draws attention to the millions of lives affected by the transatlantic slave trade and its legacies. Liverpool first coordinated commemorative events for the remembrance day in 1999, when the council issued a formal apology for its role in the transatlantic slave trade. According to National Museums Liverpool (NML), ships from Liverpool carried about 1.5 million Africans across the Atlantic in horrific conditions between 1700 and 1807. This year, the ISM, in collaboration with NML, has organised workshops, lectures and a walk, which will culminate with a libation ceremony at Canning Dock. The quaysides and dry docks there were used to clean and repair ships used to traffic enslaved people across the Atlantic. Maxine Brown, a community engagement manager at NML, said such events should be replicated across the country. \u201cDefinitely it should be spread across the UK \u2026 there\u2019s a lot of people that are committed, from the very first Slavery Remembrance Day, they\u2019ve not missed one,\u201d she said. Charters, who was a community activist for 40 years before leading the ISM, added: \u201cIt continues to be an important moment in our busy city, to pause and remember the many lives impacted by this abhorrent trade, as well as the legacies and achievements of people of the African diaspora.\u201d She added: \u201cI want to make sure that what I\u2019ve done, Maxine\u2019s done, and many people in the communities in tackling the race and discrimination we face \u2026 that we\u2019ve put real pillars of hope and real programmes of engagement.\u201d The ISM is thought to be the world\u2019s first museum dedicated to slavery internationally. It will close in 2025 for three years to embark on a multimillion pound redevelopment paid for by the National Lottery Heritage Fund. Charters said the redevelopment would create a research centre where historians and scholars could carry out work that fed into the museum and informed work around the world. She said she continues to be shocked by discoveries related to the transatlantic slave trade. \u201cTo be quite truthful, 30 years later, I\u2019m sitting here and I am still shocked by the constant uncovering of our history. That is why I said there is no full stop to transatlantic slavery,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will never ever be able to really, even for us as an institution that\u2019s been committed to transatlantic slavery \u2026 I truly don\u2019t believe we\u2019re ever going to fully uncover what has been lost to us, what has been taken from us and what we have been denied in terms of our heritage, our culture, our traditions.\u201d The leader of Liverpool city council, Liam Robinson, said: \u201cTwenty-five years ago the city council rightly apologised for its shameful role in the transatlantic slave trade \u2013 publicly putting on record our commitment to remembering, educating and fighting against racism and inequality. \u201cSlavery Remembrance Day has now become a significant date in our cultural calendar, a time when we can reflect on this remorseful part of our heritage and honour the memory of those enslaved Africans who suffered and died.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-22T07:52:15Z",
            "content": "Both of Canada\u2019s major rail freight companies have shut down their rail networks in the country and locked out nearly 10,000 workers after unsuccessful negotiations with a major union. The decision, confirmed by the Teamsters union, sets the stage for an unprecedented rail stoppage that could badly damage the Canadian economy and have a significant effect on cross-border trade with the US. Canada is the world\u2019s second-largest country by area and relies heavily on rail transport. The stoppage is expected to cripple shipments of grain, potash and coal while also slowing the transport of petroleum products, chemicals and vehicles. Industry groups had urged Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government to prevent a stoppage, noting Canada\u2019s railways transport about C$380bn (\u00a3214bn) worth of goods annually. Canadian National Rail (CN) and Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC) began lockouts on Thursday morning after tense negotiations following complaints from workers over worsening job conditions failed to produce a deal. CN confirmed it had moved ahead with the lockout, saying the union \u201cdid not respond to another offer by CN in a final attempt to avoid a labour disruption\u201d. It said: \u201cWithout an agreement or binding arbitration, CN had no choice but to finalise a safe and orderly shutdown and proceed with a lockout.\u201d The union said: \u201cDespite months of good faith negotiations on the part of the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, parties remain far apart, and both CN and CPKC have began their lockout of 00:01 today \u2026 Despite the lockout, the Teamsters remain at the bargaining table with both companies.\u201d In its announcement, CPKC said: \u201cThe TCRC [union] leadership continues to make unrealistic demands that would fundamentally impair the railway\u2019s ability to serve our customers with a reliable and cost-competitive transportation service.\u201d A pause to freight traffic will have cascading effects on Canada and the US. According to the Railway Association of Canada, affected rail carries more than C$1bn worth of goods each day. Nearly half the aviation fuel used at Toronto\u2019s Pearson airport, Canada\u2019s busiest air terminal, arrives by rail. More than 32,000 commuters in Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto rely on the rail network. A strike would also hit the mining, agriculture and retail industries. The federal labour minister, Steven MacKinnon, said on Wednesday night that he had completed meetings with the companies and the Teamsters union. He called for urgency at the negotiating table and for a deal to be done. In recent days, the Calgary-based CPKC and Montreal-based CN had started winding down operations. In Canada, both companies, valued at roughly C$100bn each, own virtually all of the rail track in the country and control most of the freight shipment. The country has never experienced a labour stoppage involving both companies simultaneously. As the possibility of a strike loomed, industry groups issued a joint statement calling on the government to intervene, saying it \u201chas a responsibility to protect the Canadian public and maintain national security, and it is time to act decisively to fulfil that obligation\u201d. MacKinnon last week declined a request from CN and CPKC to move negotiations to binding arbitration. \u201cThese collective bargaining negotiations belong to CN Rail, CPKC and [Teamsters] workers alone \u2013 but their effects will be borne by all Canadians,\u201d he said. On Wednesday, Trudeau said the country\u2019s two main rail companies and the Teamsters union had to settle their differences at the negotiating table, but stopped short of suggesting his government might get involved. \u201cMy message is very straightforward. It is in the best interest of both sides to continue doing the hard work at the table to find a negotiated resolution,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cMillions of Canadians, of workers, of farmers, of businesses right across the country are counting on both sides to do the work and get to a resolution.\u201d The deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, said: \u201cWe know that the best deals are reached at the bargaining table, and I am calling with extreme seriousness on the employers and on the union to roll up their sleeves to get a deal done.\u201d The union representing workers at CPKC said the company wanted to \u201cgut the collective agreement of all safety-critical fatigue provisions\u201d while those with CN said the rail operator wanted work days to be extended in western provinces, potentially creating \u201ca fatigue-related safety risk\u201d. The unions have cited fatigue management, rest periods and scheduling as key sticking points. Both companies said offers on the table were competitive and did not compromise safety.

            "content": "John Textor is in Liverpool to hold further talks with Everton\u2019s owner, Farhad Moshiri, over a proposed takeover of the club, with a deal expected to be agreed by the end of the week. The American billionaire became the third party to be granted a period of exclusivity by Blue Heaven Holdings, the company that owns Everton, last week after renewing his efforts to purchase a majority stake in the Premier League club having initially been overlooked by Moshiri in favour of the Friedkin Group. They had agreed to buy Moshiri\u2019s 94.1% stake but withdrew over concerns about the legal uncertainties surrounding the \u00a3200m in loans that 777 Partners, the first company to agree a takeover back in September, gave the club. It is understood that a \u00a3200m loan made to Everton by the Friedkin Group during their attempt to take over the club is due to be repaid. Textor, whose Eagle Football Group already has stakes in Lyon, Botafogo, Molenbeek and Crystal Palace, is understood to have arrived in London on Tuesday before travelling to Liverpool on Wednesday to meet Moshiri, with sources close to the deal anticipating that it could be agreed in the next few days. The terms are the same as in the offer made on 1 June in the previous round of bidding, with Textor understood to be confident that arranging a financing deal for Everton\u2019s new stadium at Bramley-Moore dock could allow him to delay completing the takeover until as late as January. A potential complication could be the requirement of Textor to sell his 45% stake in Palace in order to comply with Premier League rules. A bid from compatriots Josh Harris and David Blitzer, who already own 18% stakes in Palace, for around \u00a3100m is understood to have been rejected. Three other investors are believed to have expressed an interest in buying Textor\u2019s shares, including one from the Middle East and another said to be a sports-celebrity-backed group from the US. Last week the Palace chairman, Steve Parish, said he would not stand in Textor\u2019s way after he paid \u00a387.5m for a 40% stake in Palace in 2021 before extending it to 45% when he bought Lyon a year later. \u201cHe wants a club that plugs into that where he controls everything that happens. We don\u2019t think that is right for us as a club right now,\u201d Parish told the BBC. \u201cWe do collaborate with his clubs where we can.

            "date": "2024-08-20T19:00:38Z",
            "content": "Rachel Reeves is planning to raise taxes, cut spending and get tough on benefits in October\u2019s budget amid Treasury alarm that the pickup in the economy has failed to improve the poor state of the public finances. The chancellor is insisting she will still have a substantial black hole to fill despite stronger than expected growth in the first half of 2024. Strong spending on public services and welfare pushed government borrowing to \u00a33.1bn last month, more than double its level in the same month a year earlier and worse than experts had expected, according to figures released on Wednesday from the Office for National Statistics. The deficit was the highest for a July in three years and \u00a33bn higher than expected by the government\u2019s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. She announced last month that she was scrapping winter fuel payments for most pensioners, shelving plans for social care reform and axing road, rail and hospital investment as the first stage of a plan to reduce borrowing. Now the Treasury has made it clear that further hard choices would need to be made when Reeves delivers the first Labour budget since 2010 on 30 October. A source said: \u201cWe don\u2019t accept the positive economic inheritance line, given the decade that went before \u2013 but regardless, nothing in the recent data can offset the scale of the black hole in the public finances we\u2019re looking at.\u201d New chancellors traditionally seek to get bad news out of the way in the first budget after an election \u2013 a time when they can seek to blame their predecessors for any unpopular decisions they make. Reeves will receive the OBR\u2019s initial assessment of the state of the economy early next month, but she believes there is nothing to suggest the government\u2019s underlying financial position is getting any better. The International Monetary Fund has said the UK would need a one percentage point boost to its growth rate to relieve the pressures on the public finances caused by an ageing population and the transition to a zero-carbon economy. Among the changes Reeves is believed to be considering are: Raising more money from inheritance tax and capital gains tax. Sticking to plans for a 1% increase in public spending even though it would involve cuts for some Whitehall departments. Rejecting pressure to scrap the two-child benefit cap. Changing the way debt is measured to exclude the Bank of England. Reeves said before the election that she would inherit the worst public finances of any chancellor since the second world war and, after arriving at the Treasury, said the position was even worse than she had thought. She accused the Conservatives of covering up the true state of the public finances as she announced an initial \u00a35.5bn in savings to tackle a forecast \u00a322bn overspend by Whitehall departments. The subsequent figures showing the UK economy grew by 0.6% between April and June led to speculation that there might be a knock-on effect on the public finances that might allow Reeves to limit the pain in her October budget. The OBR is expected to revise up its 0.8% growth forecast for the year as a whole in its assessment for the October budget. But the Treasury pointed out that a stronger than expected recovery in the first half of 2024, when the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7, had merely made up for the soft patch in the second half of 2023, when the economy contracted for two quarters and was technically in recession. Figures from the Office for National Statistics last month showed that borrowing in the first three months of the 2024-25 financial year stood at \u00a349.8bn, which is \u00a33.2bn more than the OBR had anticipated. Government spending between April and June was \u00a3297.3bn \u2013 \u00a34.6bn more than in the same period a year earlier \u2013 partly as a result of the impact of inflation on benefits and departmental spending. The borrowing figures are often revised down as fresh data comes in, but the Treasury says borrowing is on course to exceed the OBR\u2019s \u00a387bn forecast for 2024-25 as a whole. The OBR said in March that the UK would barely meet the rule that the state\u2019s debt should be falling as a share of national income within five years. Labour has sought to stress the poor state of the public finances, while the Conservatives have tried equally hard to disparage Reeves\u2019 assessment of the economy, arguing that the new government is trying to find political cover for tax rises already planned for the budget. After last week\u2019s stronger-than-expected growth figures, Jeremy Hunt, the shadow chancellor, said they were \u201cfurther proof that Labour have inherited a growing and resilient economy\u201d. He added: \u201cThe chancellor\u2019s attempt to blame her economic inheritance on her decision to raise taxes \u2013 tax rises she had always planned \u2013 will not wash with the public.\u201d James Cleverly, one of the contenders to replace Rishi Sunak as Conservative leader, said Labour\u2019s economic inheritance was very different from how ministers billed it. \u201cThe economy is growing, unemployment is down, inflation under control,\u201d he said."

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has just released its latest revisions to its monthly non-farm payroll statistics, the official measure of US employment. And\u2026 it has cut the number of non-farm workers on payrolls across America by 818,000, as of March 2024. That cuts the size of the labour force by around 0.5%. That suggests the US jobs market has been a little less healthy than we thought. BlackRock\u2019s support for shareholder proposals on environmental and social issues has fallen to a fraction of its 2021 peak. In the 12 months to the end of June, BlackRock supported just 20 of the 493 environmental and social proposals put forward by shareholders at annual meetings, or about 4% of the total, according to its annual investment stewardship report. More here, on the FT. The larger-than-expected jump in government borrowing in July means abolishing the unpopular two-child benefit cap is unaffordable, a Treasury minister has said. Treasury chief secretary Darren Jones appeared to explicitly rule out abolishing the cap at the next Budget, after this morning\u2019s public finances showed the UK ran a deficit of \u00a33.1bn, around \u00a33bn more than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Asked about the prospects of abolishing the two-child benefit cap at the Budget on October 30, Mr Jones told the BBC\u2019s World At One programme: \u201cYou have to just look at the economic statistics that we\u2019re talking about today to understand why we just can\u2019t afford to do that right now.\u201d Jones said abolishing the cap would cost \u00a32bn to \u00a33bn per year, while borrowing for the first four months of the financial year was already \u00a34.7bn more than expected. Jones said the public expected the Government to get public spending \u201cback under control\u201d, adding: \u201cThat means that we have to make very difficult decisions that in our hearts we wouldn\u2019t want to have to make, and that includes on the two-child cap as well.\u201d That will disappoint many Labour MPs, who are keen to scrap the limit to fight child poverty. Last month, seven Labour MPs were suspended after taking part in a rebellion supporting an amendment to scrap the two-child benefit limit. In the car sector, Ford is shaking up its electric vehicle plans. The automaker is changing its strategy, with a new focus on lower prices and longer ranges for EV cars, as it aims for a \u201ccapital-efficient, profitable electric vehicle business\u201d. The changes mean it will no longer make a three-row electric sport utility vehicle (SUV), and will take a $400m charge to write down manufacturing equipment. The total cost of the move could be $1.9bn. Instead, it plans to make hybrid (or \u2018electrified\u2019) three-row SUVs, which will burn fossil fuels as well as contain an electric battery. Ford says these will be more efficient and pump out fewer emissions than \u201cpure gas\u201d vehicles, while providing a longer range than pure EVs. Ford plans to prioritise a new electric \u201cdigitally advanced commercial van\u201d in 2026, followed by two new advanced pickup trucks in 2027 and other future affordable vehicles. It says the EV market is \u201crapidly evolving\u201d as Chinese competitors expand their market share by using \u201cadvantaged cost structures\u201d such as vertical integration, low-cost engineering, and multi-energy advanced battery technology. China\u2019s BYD overtook Tesla to become the world\u2019s biggest EV maker at the start of this year, having also made major inroads into the European market. Ford President and CEO Jim Farley says: We are committed to innovating in America, creating jobs and delivering incredible new electric and hybrid vehicles that make a real difference in CO2 reduction. We learned a lot as the No. 2 U.S. electric vehicle brand about what customers want and value, and what it takes to match the best in the world with cost-efficient design, and we have built a plan that gives our customers maximum choice and plays to our strengths. It\u2019s a tale of two retailers in the US today. Target has lifted its full-year profit forecast, after reporting its first increase in quarterly comparable sales in over a year. Comparable sales at the discount store chain increased 2.0% in the second quarter of the year, at the high end of its expectations, after it slashed the prices on thousands of products. Brian Cornell, chair and chief executive officer of Target Corporation, says: \u201cWe made a commitment to get back to growth in the second quarter, and the team delivered, all while expanding operating margins and growing EPS [earnings per share] by more than 40% compared to last year. Importantly, our growth was driven entirely by traffic in stores and our digital channels, with double-digit growth in our same-day delivery services. But Macy\u2019s is finding 2024 tougher. The department store chain has cut its full-year sales forecast, and reported a 3.8% decline in net sales in the second quarter. Macy\u2019s now expects net sales of between $22.1bn and $22.4bn for the financial year, down from a previous forecast of $22.3bn to $22.9bn. Here\u2019s another handy chart from the UK public finances, showing annual borrowing as a share of the economy over the decades. The ONS estimates that borrowing in last financial year, to March 2024, was 4.4% of GDP \u2013 down from 15.1% in the Covid-hit 2021 financial year. This morning\u2019s weak public finances haven\u2019t caused any obvious ructions in the City. The stock market is calm, while the pound is hovering at $1.3030, close to the one-year high touched yesterday. Bond markets are gently firmer in the UK, with gilt yields a few ticks lower, reports Steve Clayton, head of equity funds at Hargreaves Lansdown, adding: Investors globally are waiting for Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s Friday speech to the Jackson Hole economic forum. Whether he will give the markets what they want, which is more clarity on the path of US interest rates, is entirely up to him. But the Jackson Hole speech is one of the Fed\u2019s annual rituals and comes in the run up to the US election. The Fed\u2019s last steer was that maybe a September cut is on the cards, so markets have immediately moved on to guessing how many will follow after that. Just in: Britain\u2019s competition watchdog has closed its investigation into Apple AppStore and Google Play over suspected anti-competitive conduct. But, the two tech giants aren\u2019t in the clear. Instead, the Competition and Markets Authority has decided to consider its concerns under the new digital markets competition regime, once it comes into force. It is worried that Google and Apple are abusing their market positions to set terms which may be unfair to UK app developers, by forcing them to use the Google Play or AppStore billing systems. This, it fears, could lead to higher prices and reduced choice for app users. The CMA has also rejected a proposal from Google, which would have given developers an alternative billing option. The watchdog explains: Feedback from app developers suggested Google\u2019s proposals to allow app developers to use alternative payment methods for in-app payments did not go far enough and they would in practice remain tied to the Google payment system. In particular, app developers referred to the level of commission they would still be paying to Google, and to the proposed \u2018pop-up screens\u2019 that might put users off completing a transaction. Danny Sriskandarajah, chief executive of the New Economics Foundation (NEF), says the \u201cmonthly panic around public borrowing figures\u201d needs to end. Borrowing, to invest, is a sensible strategy for a government, Sriskandarajah points out: \u201cEvery month much is made about how much the government is borrowing. But borrowing doesn\u2019t have to be scary - it\u2019s responsible for a government to borrow for investments which will improve our lives and benefit us all in the long run. \u201cThe public are being misled. A strong economy needs investment. You wouldn\u2019t wait until a patient has recovered before you treat them - it\u2019s just as misguided to wait until our economy is thriving before we invest in it. And this investment will more than pay for itself. \u201cIt\u2019s concerning that the chancellor might cut spending in the autumn budget. Decades of cuts have left us struggling to get a doctor\u2019s appointment, educating our kids in crumbling schools, and unable to find a train service that works well. This makes it harder to care for others or do well at work, creating a drag on our economy. More spending cuts will just make the problem worse. \u201cBy sticking to arbitrary borrowing and debt rules, otherwise known as \u201cfiscal rules\u201d, the government risks further undermining living conditions and leaving us unable to meet the future challenges of the climate crisis and an ageing population.\u201d If Rachel Reeves was looking for political cover for what is being billed as a budget of eye-watering severity, then the latest set of figures for the UK\u2019s public finances certainly provided it, our economics editor, Larry Elliott, writes: The chancellor has been saying since arriving at the Treasury last month that the government has been spending and borrowing a lot more than expected \u2013 and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has duly obliged with evidence to back up her case. For a start, borrowing in July alone and in the first four months of the 2024-25 financial year has come in higher than the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) was expecting at the time of Jeremy Hunt\u2019s March budget. The July figure of \u00a33.1bn was \u00a33bn higher than the OBR\u2019s forecast, while the cumulative deficit was \u00a34.7bn higher. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s analysis of today\u2019s public finances: Social housing rents will rise by more than inflation over the next decade as part of UK government plans to boost affordable housebuilding and shore up the finances of struggling landlords. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is working on plans to introduce a 10-year formula to calculate social rent homes that will result in rents increasing every year by the rate of the consumer prices index \u2013 which is now 2.2% \u2013 plus 1%, removing an existing cap on rises. Reeves is expected to announce the plan at her first budget, on 30 October, alongside measures to raise taxes and cut spending. The plan for social rent homes \u2013 those rented usually at 50% of market rate \u2013 will be welcomed by the councils and housing associations who are now facing a squeeze on their finances, which has put the brakes on housebuilding. More here: The Office for Budget Responsibility has confirmed that UK government borrowing is running ahead of its forecasts from March, by \u00a34.7bn so far this financial year. Reacting to this morning\u2019s public finances, the OBR says: The difference with our forecast profile is driven primarily by higher-than-forecast consumption spending by government departments (\u00a35.8 billion), which appears related to strong growth in public sector pay. Receipts are broadly in line with profile in the year to date. Data on central government spending remain highly provisional at this time of year. Nevertheless, they indicate that departmental spending for 2024-25 could significantly exceed the March 2024 forecast. Due to this risk, on 29 July the OBR initiated a review of the preparation of our March forecast for departmental spending, which will conclude in advance of our next forecast which is on 30 October. There are several levers Rachel Reeves could pull in the October budget, to patch up the public finances. My colleagues Larry Elliott and Peter Walker reported last night that the changes Reeves is believed to be considering include: Raising more money from inheritance tax and capital gains tax. Sticking to plans for a 1% increase in public spending even though it would involve cuts for some Whitehall departments. Rejecting pressure to scrap the two-child benefit cap. Changing the way debt is measured to exclude the Bank of England. Trade tensions between China and Europe continue to escalate. Beijing has announced a probe into EU subsidies of some dairy products imported into China, covering various types of cheeses, milks and creams intended for human consumption. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce says: \u201cThe Ministry of Commerce has decided to initiate an anti-subsidy investigation on imported relevant dairy products originating in the European Union from August 21, 2024.\u201d The move comes a day after the EU announced five-year import duties of up to 36% on Chinese electric cars. The move appears to be mainly aimed at Ireland, Reuters reports, adding: China will examine 20 subsidy schemes from across the 27-strong bloc, specifically those from Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Ireland, and Romania, it said in a statement. Of the countries listed, Ireland is by far the biggest exporter of dairy products to China, having sold $461 million worth of goods to the Asian nation last year. Away from the public finances, fast food chain McDonald\u2019s has announced it will invest \u00a31bn in the UK and Ireland over the next four years. It plans to open more than 200 new restaurants, which it says will create more than 24,000 new jobs. Alistair Macrow, CEO, McDonald\u2019s UK&amp;I, says the company is committed to investing in new opportunities and supporting growth across the UK, where it opened its first outlet in London in 1974. Macrow adds: We have come a long way since we first opened our doors in Woolwich 50 years ago. We have become an important part of communities across the UK, and I\u2019m delighted that in this milestone year we are able to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to growth, and announce the creation of new jobs across the country as we plan to open over 200 new restaurants over the next four years. July\u2019s public finances show the government faces a \u201cchallenging fiscal picture\u201d in the near term, warns Cara Pacitti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation. Pacitti explains that spending pressures suggest the public sector finances are worse than when the OBR produced their March 2024 forecast. Pacitti explains: \u201cWith borrowing \u00a33 billion higher-than-expected in July, the deteriorating state of the public finances illustrate the challenges that Rachel Reeves will face ahead of her first Budget this Autumn. \u201cThe fiscal inheritance facing the Chancellor is one of rising taxes, increasing spending challenges, and very little wriggle room in the event of bad economic news. This combines to create a challenging backdrop for the new Government to realise its ambitions of boosting growth while putting the public finances on a sustainable path.\u201d Today\u2019s public sector numbers confirm that fiscal progress remains disappointing so far this year and strengthen the view that the government will be forced into some tax rises at the 30 October Budget. So says Philip Shaw, economist at City firm Investec. He told clients this morning: We are currently only a third of the way through the financial year and it is early to be drawing concrete conclusions about the medium-term path of the public finances. However as things stand, the relatively poor trend in borrowing indicates that the fiscal headroom from the previous government\u2019s fiscal mandate (\u00a38.9bn) could be completely eliminated. This is especially the case when one bears in mind the relatively generous public sector pay settlements sanctioned by the current government and that as things stand, non-protected government departments would be faced with a decline in their budgets in real terms over the medium-term. It is possible that Chancellor Rachel Reeves loosens the rules a little, but this would risk undermining her fiscal credibility. Inheritance tax has brought in an extra \u00a3200m so far this year, new figures from HMRC show. Inheritance Tax receipts for April to July 2024 were \u00a32.8bn, up from \u00a32.6bn in the same period last year. HMRC says the increase is due to increased asset values pushing up the value of estates, and the previous government\u2019s decision to freeze IHT thresholds. Rachael Griffin, tax and financial planning expert at Quilter, says the increase will \u201crekindle debates\u201d about whether this tax will be increased as the government attempts to shore up the public finances. Griffin explains: Speculation is rife that the Chancellor might introduce changes to IHT, particularly targeting Agricultural Property Relief (APR) and Business Property Relief (BPR). These reliefs, which currently allow farms and family businesses to be passed down without incurring prohibitive tax liabilities, might be scaled back. Labour might opt to remove APR for those who do not actually own farmland and BPR where it doesn\u2019t meet the intention of the relief i.e. protecting small businesses being kept \u2018in the family\u2019. However, the unintended consequences could be huge especially for the AIM market which relies heavily on the shares being eligible for BPR after holding the shares for two years. This might therefore hamper Labour\u2019s stated aim of getting more investment into UK plc. The big picture remains that the UK\u2019s national debt is the highest since the early 1960s, as a share of the economy. Public sector net debt excluding public sector banks is now estimated to be 99.4% of gross domestic product (GDP), at around \u00a32.74 trillion. That\u2019s an increase of 3.8 percentage points since July 2023. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says: \u201cWe expect ... Reeves to borrow around 20 billion pounds per year more than planned in the March Budget for the next five years as well as funding medium-term spending with higher taxes.\u201d Today\u2019s public finances show that the UK\u2019s decent-looking growth rate this year does not mean that everything is rosy in the economy. Isabel Stockton, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, explains: Tax revenues - despite economic growth in the first quarter of the financial year surpassing some of the more pessimistic expectations - are running close to forecast or, if anything, slightly behind. This, combined with higher spending, leaves borrowing higher than forecast. Stockton adds: All of these data are preliminary and we should be cautious of over-interpreting them. But the early signs are that better-than-expected growth figures won\u2019t be enough save Rachel Reeves from tough choices in her first Budget on 30 October. The combination of in-year spending pressures identified at last month\u2019s spending audit and the ongoing, and well known, pressures facing many public services suggest that the accompanying spending review for 2025-26 could be a particularly difficult exercise.\u201d July\u2019s public finances figures continued the recent run of bad news on the fiscal position, says Alex Kerr, UK economist at Capital Economics. Kerr reckons that public borrowing is track to overshoot the OBR\u2019s 2024/25 forecast of \u00a387.2bn by \u00a34.7bn. Even if this overshoot does not persist, Capital Economics expect the Chancellor to raise taxes and increase borrowing at the Budget on 30th October. Kerr explains: Overall, today\u2019s release highlights the tight fiscal backdrop that the Chancellor faces ahead of her first Budget on 30th October. We still think that she will look to raise an additional \u00a310bn a year via higher taxes in the Budget and increase borrowing by around \u00a37bn a year. The increase in borrowing in July leaves Rachel Reeves with \u201clittle headroom\u201d ahead of October\u2019s budget, warns Dennis Tatarkov, senior economist at KPMG UK. \u201cBorrowing in July was ahead of OBR forecasts and could rise further if the announced overspend makes its way into the revised figures. This could take borrowing for the 2023-24 fiscal year to over \u00a390bn if significant savings cannot be found. \u201cStrong GDP growth in the first half of the year has helped bring higher than expected revenues, which in July were \u00a399.4bn and ahead of projections made during the March Budget. However, an expected slowing in GDP growth ahead could limit revenues in the second half of the year. \u201cWe estimate the headroom that the Chancellor has to meet current fiscal rules has shrunk further, down to \u00a36bn from \u00a39bn in March. This may mean that the targets themselves could see a tweak in the upcoming Autumn Budget.\u201d Britain spent \u00a37bn paying interest on the national debt in July. That\u2019s the second highest interest payable in any July since records began in 1997, the ONS says. That\u2019s lower than the \u00a38bn interest bill in July 2023, though, as falling inflation lowered the debt bill on index-linked bonds. Government expenditure jumped by \u00a33.5bn year-on-year in July \u2013 more than cancelling out the increase in tax \u2013 to \u00a3107.4bn. This was primarily due to a \u00a32.7bn increase in benefits, linked to inflation. There was also a \u00a31.3bn rise in central government departmental spending, as inflation and pay rises increased running costs. Digging into July\u2019s public finances, we can see that higher tax receipts lifted central government\u2019s income to \u00a391.0bn in July \u2013 \u00a31.7bn more than in July 2023. Tax receipts increased by \u00a32.1bn to \u00a371.2bn, including a \u00a31.7bn increase in income tax receipts, \u00a3300m more in corporation tax, and \u00a3200m of VAT. But, there was a \u00a31.1bn drop in \u201ccompulsory social contributions\u201d, to \u00a313.8bn, due to the reductions in the main rates of National Insurance made by former chancellor Jeremy Hunt. Self-assessment tax receipts rose by \u00a31.1bn year-on-year to \u00a312.9bn. However, that\u2019s \u00a3700m less than the OBR had forecast (one reason the deficit was much higher than the \u00a3100m expected by the fiscal watchdog). The jump in UK government borrowing last month shows the \u201cdire inheritance\u201d left by the previous government, says chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones: \u201cToday\u2019s figures are yet more proof of the dire inheritance left to us by the previous government. \u201cA \u00a322 billion black hole in the public finances this year, a decade of economic stagnation and public debt at its highest level since the 1960s, with taxpayers\u2019 money being wasted on debt interest payments rather than on our public services. \u201cWe are taking the tough decisions that are needed to fix the foundations of our economy, modernise our public services and rebuild Britain so we can put more money back into people\u2019s pockets across the country.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The health, or unsoundness, of Britain\u2019s public finances is a key issue for Westminster and the City of London, with a painful autumn budget looming. And the latest public finances data, just released, shows that the UK borrowed more than twice as much as economists expected last month to balance the books. Public borrowing hit \u00a33.1bn in July, which is \u00a31.8bn more than in July 2023. It\u2019s the highest July borrowing since 2021 (when the Covid-19 pandemic drove up spending and hit tax revenues). City economists had expected lower borrowing, of \u00a31.5bn. Crucially, the fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, had estimated the UK would only need to borrow \u00a3100m in July \u2013 which is typically a strong month for tax receipts, such as income tax self-assessment returns. So, the black hole in the public finances which chancellor Rachel Reeves warned of in July has just got deeper. Although the tax take increased in July, this was more than wiped out by higher government spending. ONS deputy director for public sector finances, Jessica Barnaby, explains: \u201cJuly borrowing was almost \u00a32 billion higher this year than in 2023. Revenue was up on last year, with income tax receipts in particular growing strongly. However, this was more than offset by a rise in central government spending where, despite a reduction in debt interest, the cost of public services and benefits continued to increase.\u201d The ONS has also revised some of its earlier public finances data, which has reduced its estimate of borrowing since April by \u00a31.5bn,. It now estimates the UK has borrowed \u00a351.4bn so far this financial year. That\u2019s \u00a3500m less than was borrowed in the same four months last year, but \u00a34.7bn more than the \u00a346.6 billion forecast by the OBR for this period. This increase in borrowing intensifies the pressure on Rachel Reeves to make tough decisions in her first fiscal event, this autumn. As the Guardian reported last night, the chancellor is planning to raise taxes, cut spending and get tough on benefits in October\u2019s budget as she tries to fill a substantial black hole in the public finances \u2013 despite stronger than expected growth in the first half of 2024.

            "title": "Gina Rinehart\u2019s latest grab-bag of opinions is more proof billionaires are no smarter than the rest of us | John Quiggin",
            "date": "2024-08-24T00:00:18Z",
            "content": "A striking feature of the age of billionaires in which we now live is that billionaires are more and more inclined to give us the benefit of their opinions. In the past year alone, we\u2019ve had Marc Andreessen\u2019s retro-futurist \u201cTechno-optimist manifesto\u201d, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s pronouncements on the future of media, and, most recently, a cosy chat between Elon Musk and Donald Trump (whose billionaire status is often touted but remains questionable). In most cases, the main effect has been to demonstrate that, however good they are at making money, billionaires are no smarter than the rest of us when it comes to politics or the ordinary business of life. Australia\u2019s richest billionaire by far is Gina Rinehart, who has massively multiplied the already substantial fortune she inherited from her father, the late Lang Hancock (Rinehart claims she inherited more debts than assets). Like Hancock, who spent decades on the rightwing fringe of Australian politics, Rinehart has never been shy about expressing her opinions. A look at those opinions suggests that, taken as a whole, they would pass the \u201cpub test\u201d, in that they are about as sophisticated and intellectually consistent as you might expect to hear in the evening at a public bar. In common with many opinionators, Rinehart disdains the constraints of arithmetic, simultaneously demanding lower taxes, more public spending and lower deficits, all to be paid for by eliminating unspecified waste, fraud and duplication. A recent piece in the Daily Telegraph, published as part of a News Corp \u201cBush summit\u201d series, illustrates this point. Hancock begins with a familiar litany of woes about the high costs faced by farmers and the burden of (unspecified) red tape, forcing them off the land. This part of her article could have been (and has been) written any time in the past 50 years or more. No one reading this sad tale would be aware that farm incomes have been at record highs last year, an outcome reflected in strongly increased land prices. The executive director of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, noted at the time: \u201cWhen you look at the cropping sector in particular, average farm incomes are about 75% above the 10-year average \u2013 about $665,000 \u2013 up slightly from last year.\u201d Farming is a risky business and these outcomes depended in part on a string of good seasons that came to an end this year, with farm incomes now back to where they were three years ago. But a rebound seems likely, making Rinehart\u2019s gloomy pronouncements seem overstated, to say the least. Turning to remedies, Rinehart wants a string of tax reductions, including the abolition of payroll tax and stamp duties along with reductions in excise tax on fuel. A striking feature of this wishlist is that most of the benefits would go to city dwellers. Few farm businesses are large enough to reach the threshold for payroll tax. Family-owned farm businesses are exempt from stamp duty on intra-family transfers, while city dwellers routinely pay tens of thousands of dollars as a cost of moving house. Finally, no excise tax is paid for on-farm (or mining) use of fuel. These proposals aren\u2019t matched by a willingness to accept reduced public services. After acknowledging the need for \u201cnurses, police, hospitals, health care, our increasing numbers of elderly, emergency services and veterans (And much more)\u201d, Rinehart goes on to demand a massive increase in provision of these services to rural areas, saying that \u201cthe Pilbara in Western Australia should have some of the best hospitals and infrastructure in the world, plus some of the best playgrounds and sports facilities\u201d. Some areas of public expenditure didn\u2019t make it on to her list, but Rinehart has covered many of them elsewhere. She has been a keen proponent of publicly subsidised dams, relaxing means tests on pensions and more spending on defence (apparently to be financed by selling off the defence department\u2019s \u201cpot plants, paintings and sculptures\u201d). The closest Rinehart comes to suggesting a cut in public expenditure is a nebulous reference to handouts of \u201canother $500m here, another $500m there\u201d, most of which is apparently spent within the Canberra bureaucracy. Doing away with these would supposedly cover the tens of billions of dollars of reduced revenue and higher spending implied by her lengthy wish list. And, of course, all of this is to be achieved while cutting debt and deficits, lest we share the fate of Sri Lanka and Argentina. There\u2019s nothing particularly unusual about Rinehart\u2019s grab-bag of opinions. You can hear similar thoughts in any public bar (or, with minor variations, any inner-city coffee shop). But as a contribution to discussion of public policy, they are best left there. John Quiggin is a professor at the University of Queensland\u2019s school of economics"

            "date": "2024-08-30T05:00:01Z",
            "content": "When writing profiles on Rachel Reeves, eight out of 10 journalists like to record her past as a chess champion, largely as a pretext for chuckling through metaphors about gambits and defensive positions. Never in danger of prodigy status, these days I skulk on a chess app, slugging it out with other amateur thugs. But as Reeves and Keir Starmer settle into Downing Street, one of the game\u2019s sayings returns to my mind. It\u2019s from the Polish grandmaster and wit Savielly Tartakower, who observed: \u201cThe blunders are all on the board, waiting to be made.\u201d The blunder is a huge, match-losing error, which only becomes obvious in hindsight. Tartakower is saying that however good either player is, the board will confer a defeat. You can take his point further: loss may not come from that rash exchange, but the foolproof strategy you swore would win. That lesson is one that Labour\u2019s leaders should bear in mind. Starmer and Reeves don\u2019t do surprises. Deliberative as any club player, they make a plan and stick to it for as long as is tenable. That way, they present the tiniest of targets for opponents and the press. Over the previous five years, No 10 served sketch writers and columnists a sumptuous feast: a malfunctioning droid (Theresa May), the blond Nero (Boris Johnson) and ChatGPT Thatcher (you know). Now the pack tails this prime minister from Westminster to Berlin to Paris, eager for slips and scandals. Pickings are so thin that not one, but two of the Mail\u2019s star writers grouse that their man is an \u201cundertaker\u201d. Yet the blunders are all on the board. One theory about the general election is that it was a verdict on the party of wine-time Fridays and gold wallpaper. Britons were sick of being led by donkeys in blue rosettes, runs the story, so they shooed them out. Some around Starmer believe this, and by making this week\u2019s speech in the Downing Street rose garden, the prime minister reminded us that it was the setting for Johnson\u2019s lockdown-busting bacchanalia \u2013 of which he was the sober opposite. But election polling reliably showed that the public\u2019s biggest worry was the economy. As I wrote at the campaign\u2019s launch, Rishi Sunak\u2019s humiliation was already as good as sealed by two factors. First, the last parliament was, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies judged, the worst for living standards for which there are comparable records. Rocketing fuel bills, soaring food prices, medicine shortages \u2013 voters don\u2019t forget such things, and in July they did not forgive. Second, with hospitals and schools at breaking point, the tax burden hit a 70-year high. The electorate is paying more for less. Game over. These are the 10-ton facts of British government after the pandemic, after the banking crash, now the era of free money and cheap energy is over \u2013 and on those, Starmer is barely different from Sunak. Labour committed itself to plans that imply spending cuts of about \u00a320bn every year \u2013 beyond the \u00a322bn of savings for which Reeves has spent this summer scratching around. This was no oversight, no unforced error: it was core to Starmer\u2019s plan for winning, by robbing critics of their chance to snipe about a \u201cdebt bombshell\u201d and the like. A great election strategy, a dire platform for government. The blunders are all on the board. The most important political moment for this winter did not come from Starmer. It wasn\u2019t in a speech, or a treaty. It was the announcement from the energy regulator that gas and electricity prices will go up by 10% from the start of October, taking the average annual bill to more than \u00a31,700. While fuel bills are nowhere near the peak they hit in the winter of 2022-23, they remain far above the levels that we were used to. As Katie Schmuecker of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says, for lower income households, this is \u201can unrelenting cost of living crisis\u201d. As the country learned last time, higher energy prices blow out nearly everything else, from grocery bills to school budgets. The big difference is that today, there is far less state support. No Tory cost of living payments to people on benefits, worth \u00a3900 a year. A much-reduced winter fuel allowance for pensioners. Reeves may well resurrect the household support fund of small handouts for the worst hit, but that is a cocktail umbrella in a gale. Cast your mind forward to this winter. The bills are hitting the mat, and taxes are going up. This week, Starmer called these \u201cthe big asks \u2026 short-term pain for long-term good\u201d. But there have been years of supposedly short-term pain. Over 4m low-income households are already in arrears on at least one bill or debt, while the number of poor households going without food, heating or toiletries hasn\u2019t dipped below 7m in two years. The NHS in England needs an extra \u00a338bn a year to cut backlogs. Seven years after Grenfell prompted all manner of promises about ending the scandal of dodgy cladding, a tower block on the other side of London erupted in flames. After Covid, after double-digit inflation, after austerity, millions of families and whole swaths of our public services are exhausted. This picture is clear in the statistics and from wandering down the dilapidated high streets of much of Britain, including those towns that saw racist pogroms earlier this month. Yet it barely registers in Westminster discourse. Instead, the newspapers truffle out tasty morsels about Morgan McSweeney v Sue Gray \u2013 office politics instead of actual politics, debates about desks rather than social housing. Commentators ask for Starmer\u2019s vision, without interrogating his actual promises. Take Labour\u2019s pledge to achieve \u201cthe highest sustained growth\u201d of all the G7 richest countries \u2013 a feat not in any government\u2019s gift. How would Starmer do that, by locking up Kamala Harris and Emmanuel Macron? The great fight of this parliament won\u2019t be over blueprints or programmes. It will simply be about the degree to which a Labour government is able to show that it can protect its society from a new era of economic instability, while repairing the vast damage done by years of spending cuts and pushing teachers, nurses and other public servants to the very limit. On all this, the very compromises Starmer made to get into power will limit his ability to do much with that power. The blunders are all on the board, waiting to be made.

            "date": "2024-08-04T11:00:28Z",
            "content": "Jackson, Mississippi, knows the blues. There\u2019s the old men at sunset carting old amps through a full parking lot to the back of an otherwise nondescript bar, to deliver a fearless late-night symposium in the oldest school of blues. And then there\u2019s the Jackson that wakes up in the morning wondering how many young men got killed somewhere else that night. Jackson isn\u2019t just Mississippi\u2019s capital. It\u2019s America\u2019s murder capital, two years running. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba is perfectly, painfully aware that his city has a murder problem. And he wants to do something about it. \u201cOur residents aren\u2019t against police,\u201d he said. \u201cOur residents are supportive of having more law enforcement to cover gaps and show presence. But they want a police force that is accountable to them.\u201d But who do those police officers answer to? In a city where 83% of residents are Black and 90% of its voters are Democrats, the only person who lives there with the power to hire or fire the capitol police chief is the white Republican living south of Smith Park in the governor\u2019s mansion. This is a democracy problem. The response of Mississippi\u2019s predominantly white conservative state legislators and Republican governor, Tate Reeves, to violent crime in the state capital last year was to expand the jurisdiction of the Mississippi capitol police department, a state-controlled agency. House Bill 1020 expanded the footprint of the Capitol Complex Improvement District to much of north-east Jackson, while creating a parallel court system to handle cases brought by the capitol police, bypassing the district attorney and locally elected judges. Jackson\u2019s murder problem is real. The national homicide rate per 100,000 people in the United States was about 5.5 in 2023. Jackson\u2019s high-water mark in 2021 was a staggering 99.5. Last year Jackson\u2019s rate was 78.8.. Though violent crime has been falling across the country, Mississippi overall had a homicide rate of 19.4 per 100,000, the highest of any state. Jackson is a fraction of that: only about one out of 20 of Mississippi\u2019s roughly 3 million residents live in Jackson. Take Jackson\u2019s 138 murders out of the state\u2019s 2022 calculation, and Mississippi still has a murder rate of 14.6, about three times the national average. Poverty incubates violence. Mississippi has the highest poverty rate in the country and most of Jackson\u2019s murders are in its poorest neighborhoods. But the section of Jackson covered by the capitol police is not where you find most of Jackson\u2019s murder problem. It is where most of Jackson\u2019s white people live. \u201cIf it\u2019s a notion about how we make it safer, then please justify why they are in the areas with the lowest crime?\u201d Lumumba asks rhetorically. He surmises that it is one more extension of white conservative contempt of the state\u2019s largest city, a Black-majority city viewed as unable to act in its own interest on how to operate a police department. \u201cSomeone from north Mississippi certainly doesn\u2019t have a greater interest or desire for safety within our communities than we have for ourselves,\u201d Lumumba said. \u201cAnd so, it\u2019s paternalistic. I think it is underpinned in partisanship. Also quite frankly, and honestly, it reeks of racism.\u201d *** Over a chicken biscuit and coffee in middle-class north Jackson, Dr Anita DeRouen, a high school English teacher and former college professor, recounted a drive-by shooting at an empty house last year, up the street from her own in midtown. \u201cI was outside packing up my car and I hear what sounds like three pow pow pow,\u201d she said. The city cops responded, eventually, she said. Little came of it; no one had been hurt. Her house is just inside the footprint of the Capitol Complex Improvement District now. She has a doctorate in English and still does a thing that\u2019s characteristic of Black people talking about race in Mississippi. Rather than refer to it directly, she points to the brown skin on the back of her hand when she means Black people. If she has to call the police now, the capitol police respond first. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve noticed is, I do see more police in my neighborhood when there\u2019s a reason to call the police. Right? Do people feel more confident calling the police? I don\u2019t know. I just see them around.\u201d DeRouen\u2019s concern about the capitol police district is about who they will police, and to whom they will be accountable. \u201cAs a person living in Jackson, I was more concerned about the court situation that came along with that. Because we elect our judges, and they weren\u2019t going to be elected judges,\u201d she said. \u201cThe thing that struck me about the district as a whole was that it was so carved out to protect as many white people as they can.\u201d The police chiefs of each agency talk to each other regularly, and talk in public about trying to coordinate their efforts. A police officer responding to a call in the CCID in Jackson\u2019s north is one fewer to answer a call in the south, after all. But Joseph Wade, chief of the Jackson police department, has found himself telling the public that his cops haven\u2019t been replaced. \u201cI tell the citizens all the time; we\u2019re still going to maintain a footprint within the CCID,\u201d he said to the Jackson city council in May. \u201cWe\u2019re not vacating \u2026 but it gives us an opportunity to deploy our resources to higher-crime areas in Jackson.\u201d Wade came to the job less than a year ago with a community-oriented policing strategy to address the city\u2019s violence. He holds regular community meetings where he shares crime data and solicits feedback from the public. The city established an office of violence prevention and trauma recovery last year, which works to intercept people who are likely to commit an act of violence \u2013 or to be a victim of violence \u2013 before they add to Jackson\u2019s statistics. The Jackson city police department fields about 275 officers. The capitol police have about 200 and are staffing up to get to 225, chief Bo Luckey said in public comments in May. Neither agency is unblemished. Even as the legislature was considering a plan to expand the authority of the capitol police, the department was under scrutiny for a series of questionable shootings. In one case, an officer fired into an apartment building while chasing a suspected car thief, shooting a woman asleep in her bed. In another, police appear to have shot through the windshield of a car, killing 25-year-old Jaylen Lewis. People around Jackson are touchy about policing right now after the revelations of the Goon Squad torture case in neighboring Rankin county. The federal investigation resulted in convictions for six white Rankin county deputies who sexually humiliated and abused two Black men, shooting one in the mouth. The trial surfaced a pattern of misconduct that still has the community reeling. Local law enforcement in Jackson bristles at any comparison between their policing and that of the Rankin sheriff\u2019s office. Jackson police are still digging out from criticism for failing to notify Bettersten Wade that her son Dexter Wade, had been killed by an off-duty police officer and \u2013 despite having ID and her phone calls to the coroner\u2019s office \u2013 was buried in an anonymous pauper\u2019s grave behind the county jail. The city and county remain at odds over who should take blame; meanwhile Jackson reformed its notification processes in the wake of public scrutiny. In comparison, two years after the Lewis shooting, Mississippi public safety officials have remained unwilling to reveal basic details about the event to Lewis\u2019s family, citing a continuing \u201cinvestigation\u201d. State officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story. The mayor noted that the city\u2019s clearance rate for homicide investigation\u2019s is above 70%, an indication that the public is willing to work with city police to solve crime. The national average is around 50%. Lumumba insists that the violence in Jackson is not a product of poor policing, drawing a contrast in approach with the capitol police. \u201cBut the fact that new problems surface, new interpersonal conflicts take place means that there\u2019s a gap that we\u2019re not filling,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I only say that to say that this is absent in the consideration of the state, as they try to approach a safer environment for Jackson from a paternalistic standpoint. They don\u2019t engage community.\u201d *** Downtown Jackson has been losing population for a generation. You can drive long vacant stretches between buildings before finding signs of life inside. Depopulation isn\u2019t just a Jackson problem \u2013 when you look at the list of shrinking communities in America, Mississippi towns like Greenville, Clarksdale and Vicksburg top the list, all expectations of Sun belt growth be damned. People are fleeing poverty. The emptiness creates problems for those who remain: squatters and unobserved spaces nurturing crime. Loss begets a vicious cycle. But people live in this town. Many are thriving. An hour before blues time at Hal and Mal\u2019s, Jackson\u2019s resident drag queen Penny Nickels was finishing up trivia night at the other end of the bar. It\u2019s a monthly event held by Mississippi Capital City Pride. They\u2019re worried about how the police will handle anti-queer harassment. \u201cI\u2019ve had protesters outside protesting, just me. I\u2019m just one queen,\u201d Nickels said. \u201cI\u2019ll be getting out of the car in the parking lot, and they will be coming out. Like they will be yelling directly after me.\u201d The city\u2019s Pride festival is a major event in Jackson, and has long had administrative support from the city government, said Chris Ellis, chair-elect of Mississippi Capital City Pride. \u201cThe governor vacates the premises while we\u2019re around,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cI\u2019m sure if he was there, he would ignore us, pretend we don\u2019t exist, or outright claim that we\u2019re, you know, degenerates, and all that good stuff.\u201d Jackson\u2019s LGBTQ+ activists fought for protections from bullhorn-wielding protesters during Pride, and the city responded with an ordinance limiting how amplified sound can be used in public. Alas, the capitol police do not enforce Jackson city ordinances. That complicates the coordination Jackson\u2019s police department hopes to achieve with the capitol police. For the moment, a single 911 system handles all calls for the city, regardless of type. \u201cWhen a citizen dials 911, they don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a city ordinance or a state law,\u201d Wade said. The legislature anticipated this problem. Reeves vetoed a bill extending local ordinance enforcement authority to the department, because he doesn\u2019t like the city\u2019s politics. In a Facebook message explaining his veto, Reeves said capitol police should not be obligated to uphold local laws restricting police from pursuing immigration violations, describing Jackson as a so-called sanctuary city. \u201cI believe, if this bill were to become law, the capitol police could not assist ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] in deporting illegal aliens that live in this community,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cAny time or attention \u2013 from an already under-resourced police force \u2013 on dealing with city ordinances [of which there are hundreds and none of which have been contemplated, much less approved, by the state] and code enforcement is an unnecessary diversion of personnel from their mission of finding and arresting the criminals.\u201d Reeves did sign legislation requiring any protest next to state property in Jackson to obtain the written permission of the Mississippi public safety director or the capitol police chief. That legislation has been blocked in federal court. Jackson\u2019s annual Pride march \u2013 which is held in an area that is now covered by the CCID \u2013 is nonetheless caught between the governor and his politics, Ellis said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always done a march around Jackson as part of our festivities every year,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re talking about not doing that because it\u2019s in the purview of the capitol police.\u201d *** \u201cThe reason he even stopped me was because I had my white girlfriend in the car.\u201d Just after leaving an arraignment hearing at the Hinds county courthouse in Jackson, a Black man in his 30s nervously, described the reasons he ran from a traffic stop from a capitol police officer in an unmarked car earlier this year. As the Jacksonian talks jackrabbit fast, he\u2019s reliving the event. He requested anonymity to help prevent reprisals. \u201cSo he profiled me. I was driving her car,\u201d the young man said, explaining how the officer pulled him over because his girlfriend was with him. \u201cHe gets out. I just see him waving the gun. \u201cI instantly take off, police or no police. This is supposed to be a traffic stop. I\u2019m not wanted for anything. And I haven\u2019t did anything. But I\u2019ve been assaulted by the police. I\u2019ve been beat for nothing. They were supposed to be taking me to jail, instead they put gloves on, beat me and they just dropped me off in a neighboring neighborhood.\u201d In his recollection, Jackson city police tuned him up in an alley some years ago. But it was capitol police that went after him recently. Jackson is depressing, he said. \u201cCorrupt politicians, corrupt government system, corrupted \u2026 everything is fucked up. The streets have potholes. There are great people, but living under these circumstances, it creates chaos. The poverty contributes to crime, There\u2019s no resources for our kids for anything to do. You can even have a degree, but you still have to know someone. Yeah, and this is being real. \u201cIf you can make it here, you can make anywhere. But if you didn\u2019t make it out of here, then really, it was all against you anyway.\u201d *** An afternoon in a courtroom at the Hinds county courthouse will break your heart. On a random Monday in July, two dozen men and women \u2013 mostly men, almost exclusively Black men shackled together \u2013 passed before the bench. The state\u2019s initial legislative plan called for the establishment of a parallel court system for cases brought by the capitol police, bypassing Hinds county superior court. Chief justice Michael K Randolph, a white conservative Republican, would have appointed the judge for this court. Its prosecutors would be appointed by the attorney general, Lynn Fitch, also a white conservative Republican. A fifth circuit federal court approved the basic concept in affirming the law last year. But Mississippi\u2019s state supreme court also ruled last year that the court\u2019s judges could not be appointed and hear felonies under the Mississippi constitution. So now the plan is for the court to be restricted to misdemeanor cases, said Hinds county superior court judge Johnnie McDaniels. \u201cThe idea was that court was created to alleviate the backlog of cases in Hinds county. But I\u2019m not sure we have a backlog of cases in terms of misdemeanor cases,\u201d he said. \u201cMy position has always been that the state legislature should simply fund two other circuit court judges for Hinds county, so that we can address the real backlog of the number of cases we have. We have a a number of murder cases, a number of all types of cases. And our judges work extremely hard.\u201d Almost all of the defendants had court-appointed attorneys because they were too poor to afford private counsel. Most stood accused of relatively minor crimes. Probation violations, because they didn\u2019t want to show up in front of a probation officer without money to pay their fines. Drug possession. Running from the cops. But four faced murder charges. Senior judge Winston Kidd said what came through court that day was fairly normal. The murder problem is real. \u201cAnd I acknowledged that when [SB] 1020 came out,\u201d he said, referring to the bill that expanded the capitol police department\u2019s power. \u201cI acknowledged this problem. But no one could tell us why do we need this bill? The only thing I could go back to was the fact that all four circuit judges are African American, and in no other jurisdiction in this state had they tried something of that nature.\u201d In 2017, the Mississippi legislature created the Capitol Complex Improvement District as a vehicle to fund infrastructure issues in Jackson. The state and the city have been feuding over control of its ageing water system. Bit by bit, the state\u2019s eye has wandered over other Jackson assets \u2013 a baseball field here, the airport over there. Jackson needs the means to alleviate long-term problems of poverty. Instead, the state looks at taking what the city has left. \u201cI\u2019m more than just looking over my shoulder,\u201d Mayor Lumumba says. \u201cI\u2019m anticipating and expecting it \u2026 In Mississippi, we\u2019re also dealing with not what they don\u2019t give us right. But an effort to take what we do have away from us.\u201d"

            "content": "The sunny terrace of Mama Angela wine bar is the perfect spot from which to appreciate the splendour of Gorizia\u2019s Piazza della Vittoria. My train from Venice took more than two hours to chug its way here, and I now find it hard to believe I am still in Italy. I\u2019m sipping a delicious Slovene orange wine, other customers are mostly chatting in local dialect and Slovenian, and across the square are a glorious baroque church, a monumental Neptune fountain and romantic pastel palaces, all dating from when this was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. But the glory days of Victory Square are long gone. For the moment, Gorizia is one of those rare hidden gems that is simply not on the radar of most tourists, or even most Italians. At the end of the second world war, the city was unceremoniously split between post-Mussolini Italy and communist Yugoslavia. A brutal metal barrier, topped with barbed wire and patrolled by armed soldiers, separated homes and families, as happened in Berlin, but this town\u2019s fate had little attention from the world\u2019s media. All that is set to change. Thousand-year-old Gorizia and Slovenia\u2019s Nova Gorica \u2013 an idealistic \u201cNew Gorizia\u201d founded in 1947 on the other side of the border \u2013 have succeeded in an audacious joint bid to become the first-ever single European capital of culture to combine cities in two countries. From February 2025, an ambitious programme of 600 eclectic events \u2013 including music, dance, art, theatre, cinema, sport, fashion, ecology and cuisine \u2013 will reflect this \u201cborderless\u201d theme. Though tourists from around the world will be welcomed with open arms, official organiser Romina Kocina tells me: \u201cHopefully, Borderless will create a new single identity for the two cities, the perfect lasting legacy for a European capital of culture.\u201d Gorizian filmmaker Matteo Oleotto puts it more simply: \u201cFor me, the two cities have always been one, with locals crisscrossing back and forth, never thinking about which country they were in. But that was never recognised by officialdom. So I hope becoming Europe\u2019s legitimate cultural capital will change all that for the young people living here.\u201d The full calendar of events will be announced in October, and the official inauguration on 8 February 2025 will see a huge party in the symbolic Piazza della Transalpina, which is still divided in two \u2013 one half in Slovenian Nova Gorica, the other in Italian Gorizia. I am here early to border-hop and explore the two Gorizias before the crowds arrive, being sure to always carry my passport, as that is still obligatory in the EU. Gorizia seduces from the moment I start walking down Via Rastello, for centuries lined by mansions and boutiques, the commercial hub of what the Habsburgs dubbed \u201cthe Nice of Austria\u201d. This is a town always looking to fulfil its promise but not always succeeding, so while many shops are shuttered and for sale, some exciting initiatives show that locals are really counting on the future capital-of-culture effect. A splendid Liberty-style former hardware store, Casa Krainer, now hosts temporary art exhibitions and installations; an ancient osteria has been converted into a stylish but affordable B&amp;B, 1848 \u2013 Chef\u2019s Rooms (doubles \u20ac90); and Mercatino del Usato is an Aladdin\u2019s cave of recycled and vintage bric-a-brac. In Piazza della Vittoria, I rent a bike that can be dropped off either side of the border and head for Smart Space, a cutting-edge multimedia museum that provides the perfect introduction to Gorizia\u2019s complex history, including startling virtual-reality experiences of when this region saw some of the first world war\u2019s deadliest fighting. In A Farewell to Arms, Ernest Hemingway\u2019s protagonist, Frederic, lives in a house in Gorizia with a fountain and shady trees in a walled garden. Smart Space\u2019s sustainable CariGogreen project offers cycle routes into the countryside along the Slovenian frontier, with an audioguide recounting tales of 1916 battles, but I bike over to a crossing point in town where a former Italian border post has been converted into the fascinating Lasciapassare/Prepustnica exhibition. This offers an oral history by Gorizians stranded either side of the border at the time of the 1947 division. Across the street, the Slovenian border post has a more light-hearted Smuggling Museum, dedicated to black market contraband, with a fun Escape Room. In Nova Gorica proper, the contrasts are immediate. An airy, green garden city inspired by Le Corbusier, it was created 75 years ago as a socialist utopia, with modern flats, straight boulevards, municipal theatres and exhibition halls \u2013 but no churches until the breakup of Yugoslavia. The population is young, too, and there\u2019s a big student community. And, while local Slovenes love to cross into Gorizia for history, culture and food, Italians flood in the opposite direction for a taste of the great outdoors. The fast-flowing So\u010da River is perfect for kayak racing and rafting, while the surrounding countryside and forests are a maze of bike tracks and walking paths. Further on, in the Vipava valley, lie the picturesque vineyards that have put Slovenia on the wine map for its innovative natural and orange wines. In the evening, lively Nova Gorica has plenty of craft beer pubs, music bars and burger joints, but looking to taste the region\u2019s traditional cuisine, I return to check out the restaurants of what Slovenes nostalgically call Old Gorizia on the Italian side. Top addresses include Rosenbar, which is elegant but reasonably priced, and whose kitchen has been helmed for more than 30 years by one of the doyennes of the Slow Food movement, Michela Fabbro. Romantic Vecia Gorizia is in the old Jewish quarter. The menu at Antica Osteria al Sabotino changes every week using seasonal local \u201clocavore\u201d ingredients from the adjoining food market, and might include deliciously comforting traditional dishes such as frico, a Montasio cheese and potato pancake; jota, bean and sauerkraut soup; and the Mitteleuropa classic of goulash with polenta. Owner Mauro Gubana says: \u201cI cannot wait for the Capital of Culture to begin as the border controls we all grew up with seem finally to be disappearing.\u201d Transport and accommodation were provided by PromoTurismo FVG"

            "date": "2024-08-28T17:25:09Z",
            "content": "Some journalists disparage summer as a dry, barren season, but this month has yielded a bumper crop of ancient cliches. Try union barons, militant strikers or Labour paymasters. That\u2019s right, Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s pay rise for junior doctors, train drivers and others has prompted many rightwing politicians and pundits to riffle through their Roget\u2019s stale-o-saurus. Rather than laugh them off, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has promised there will be \u201cno blank cheques\u201d (another old saw). But there will be more, so much more, of the anti\u2011worker language as the Trades Union Congress meets next month and Labour ministers enact their promised new deal, which will roll back some of the most egregious legislation against trade unions from David Cameron and Rishi Sunak. Rather than adjudicate each and every one of the pay claims, it is worth making two broad points about the role of trade unions and public sector workers in our country. First and most obviously, teachers, nurses and doctors \u2013 to name just a few of the professions to whom we entrust the bodies and minds of ourselves and our loved ones \u2013 saw their pay slashed in real terms under austerity. According to analysis from the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, a typical doctor\u2019s salary is worth 15% less today than it was in 2010, a teacher is 10% down. One result is that the UK now has a shortage of doctors and teachers. That shortage means cancelled operations and no appointments before Christmas. It means schools shelling out extra on supply staff or children missing maths and science lessons. It is a headache for patients, parents, headteachers, NHS managers and government ministers. And if the right aren\u2019t perturbed by any of that, they should at least acceptthat that shortage is also a market signal that these jobs and their terms and conditions are not up to standard. Given that energy bills are set to rise by an average of 10% this winter, that pressure to do something about public sector pay would only have built. As Ms Reeves rightly observed, there was \u201ca cost to not settling\u201d. Of course, there have been warnings about the dent to public finances \u2013 but there is also a financial and social cost to industrial action, to wasted intellectual potential and to time lost while workers are ill. Second, trade unions are an essential part of a modern economy. Those \u201cunion barons\u201d are elected and accountable to their members, in a way that no FTSE chief executive is really beholden to employees, suppliers or shareholders. And their members are ordinary workers (rather than \u201cdossers\u201d or \u201clead-swingers\u201d \u2013 more cliches) who, over the past four decades, have been stripped of many of their essential rights to organise and demonstrate. Evidence suggests that, just as with privatisation and outsourcing, the UK has gone further down this road than many other rich countries. Union weakness has also weakened capitalism, according to no less an authority than the International Monetary Fund. Straight after the banking crash of 2008-09, its economists published a study arguing that a big reason for the crash was that workers were being driven to borrow more. The IMF researchers\u2019 recommendation? A \u201crestoration of the lower income group\u2019s bargaining power\u201d. In other words, Sharon Graham and Mick Lynch are good for capitalism \u2013 the IMF says so. Now there\u2019s an uncliched thought."

            "date": "2024-08-05T05:25:54Z",
            "content": "Protesting students in Bangladesh have called for a march to the capital Dhaka in defiance of a nationwide curfew on Monday to press prime minister Sheikh Hasina to resign, a day after deadly clashes in the South Asian country killed nearly 100 people. The country has been engulfed by protests and violence that began last month after student groups demanded the scrapping of a controversial quota system in government jobs. \u201cThe government has killed many students. The time has come for the final answer,\u201d protest coordinator Asif Mahmud said in a statement on Facebook late on Sunday. \u201cEveryone will come to Dhaka especially from the surrounding districts. Come to Dhaka and take a position on the streets.\u201d At least 91 people were killed and hundreds injured on Sunday according to Reuters, in a wave of violence across the country, as police fired teargas and rubber bullets to disperse tens of thousands of protesters. Demonstrators in Dhaka, surrounded by a tightly packed and cheering crowd, waved a Bangladeshi flag on top of an armoured car as soldiers watched, according to videos on social media on Sunday verified by Agence France-Presse. In several cases, soldiers and police did not intervene to stem the protests, unlike during the past month of rallies that repeatedly ended in deadly crackdowns, AFP reported. Sunday\u2019s death toll, which included at least 14 policemen, was the highest for a single day from any protests in Bangladesh\u2019s recent history, surpassing the 67 deaths reported on 19 July when students took to the streets against the quotas. Starting Sunday evening, a nationwide curfew was imposed, the railways suspended services and the country\u2019s huge garments industry closed. The government declared the indefinite nationwide curfew starting at 6pm (1200 GMT) on Sunday and also announced a three-day general holiday starting from Monday. The military urged everyone to obey the curfew rules. \u201cThe Bangladesh army will perform its promised duty in line with the Bangladesh constitution and existing laws of the country,\u201d it said in a statement late on Sunday. \u201cIn this regard the people are requested to abide by the curfew as well as give full cooperation to this end,\u201d it said. The unrest is the biggest test of Hasina\u2019s 20-year regime after she won a fourth straight term in elections that were boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party earlier this year. Demonstrations began over the reintroduction of a quota scheme that reserved more than half of all government jobs for certain groups. Critics of Hasina, along with human rights groups, have accused her government of using excessive force against protesters, a charge she and her ministers deny. For the second time during the recent protests, the government has shut down high-speed internet services, mobile operators said. Social media platforms Facebook and WhatsApp were not available, even via broadband connections. In July, at least 150 people were killed and thousands injured in violence after student groups began protesting. The protests paused after the supreme court scrapped most quotas, but students returned to the streets in sporadic protests last week, demanding justice for the families of those killed and Hasina\u2019s resignation. Hasina has said that \u201cthose who are carrying out violence are not students but terrorists who are out to destabilise the nation\u201d. With Reuters and Agence France-Presse"

            "title": "Melbourne is the only Australian capital to see a drop in house prices. What\u2019s going on?",
            "date": "2024-08-02T15:00:39Z",
            "content": "Median dwelling values in Melbourne may be overtaken by Adelaide and Perth as soon as this month, according to property data firms. Melbourne homes are now worth 4.4% less than they were at their peak in 2022, and fell 0.21% in July, according to PropTrack\u2019s latest report. Here\u2019s a look at whether the Victorian capital is on a different trajectory to other cities \u2013 and what this might mean for housing affordability and the wider economy. What\u2019s happening to housing costs in Melbourne? By a range of property measures, Melbourne (and regional Victoria) is beginning to trail other mainland capitals, according to data from CoreLogic. It was the only major city to post a drop in median value in July, with prices dropping about $100 a day to $781,949. By contrast, Adelaide values rose by about $440 a day, and will overtake Melbourne this month if the trend continues \u2013 the first time that would have happened in more than three decades. Perth, with its 2% jump in values in July, will fly past Melbourne this month for the first time since 2015 if the cities\u2019 respective trajectories continue for another month. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely diverging,\u201d said Tim Lawless, CoreLogic\u2019s research director, adding \u201cthe bottom is not falling out of the market\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cIf you look at the growth rate, it\u2019s a little bit worse than flat [but] everywhere else is generally seeing a rise,\u201d he said. Sydney\u2019s gains, though, were also levelling off. What are the trends with sales and rents? Since the start of Covid in early 2020, Melbourne dwelling prices were up more than one-tenth, or about $75,000. Sydney\u2019s were up almost 29% or $262,000, CoreLogic said. Brisbane had the largest absolute increase, at $341,000, or 64%, while Perth clocked the biggest percentage jump since Covid began, at 70% or $318,000. Melbourne\u2019s values have dropped almost 1% in the past three months, while Perth\u2019s were up more than 6%. When it comes to rents, Melbourne is not lagging. National rent increases slowed to 0.1% in July, the least since August 2020. Melbourne\u2019s rose 0.3%, or the least since December 2021, CoreLogic said. House rentals in Melbourne were 8.2% higher in July than a year earlier, trailing only Perth\u2019s 12.6% pace of increases. The cost of renting a unit in Melbourne was 7.2% higher than a year earlier, in third place behind Perth\u2019s 13.3% gain and Adelaide\u2019s 8.7%, CoreLogic said. What role is supply playing? Alone among the major cities, vendor listings in Melbourne are back above pre-Covid levels, providing one reason for the relatively weak price gains for the city. The Victorian capital now has more stock on the market than its average over the past decade, notes CBA, the largest mortgage issuer. Perth\u2019s and Adelaide\u2019s listings were down by half. \u201cThere simply isn\u2019t a demand coming into the Melbourne marketplace that we\u2019re seeing in other markets that\u2019s soaking up that level of stock being advertised for sales,\u201d CoreLogic\u2019s Lawless said. \u201c[That] gives buyers more choice and takes the urgency away from the market.\u201d Another factor is that Victoria had a \u201cmuch healthier level of new supply additions over the past decade or so\u201d, compared with other states, particularly New South Wales, he said. Is the government helping supply or demand? One drag on the market is that investors are finding other states more attractive. \u201cVictoria\u2019s in a pretty deep debt hole, and they seem to be using property taxes to help dig their way out of it,\u201d Lawless said. \u201cThat is acting as a disincentive for capital coming to the state, particularly property investments.\u201d Jacob Caine, president of the Real Estate Institute of Victoria, said there was an \u201cexodus of property investors out of the market\u201d, with rising interest rates in the past two years one driver. \u201cThe regulatory environment down here has shifted a lot over the last four years as well,\u201d he said. This included more than 130 changes to the Residential Tenancies Act, the imposition of new rental minimum standards \u2013 \u201cwhich are actually great [for] the rental experience\u201d, and \u201csignificant additional taxes\u201d. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, on Thursday said a new vacant residential land tax would encourage property owners \u201cto consider the best use of that property\u201d. The move was \u201canother example of how we are using every lever we can to build more homes, make more homes available to more Victorians\u201d. Asked whether falling property prices was good or bad, Allan replied: \u201cThat is a little bit in the eye of the beholder in terms of where you sit in the world of ownership or otherwise of real estate.\u201d What next? REIV\u2019s Caine noted Demographia\u2019s annual report still listed Melbourne as the world\u2019s seventh-least affordable city to live \u2013 behind Sydney\u2019s second-place ranking \u2013 meaning it remained \u201cincredibly challenging\u201d to enter the market. Still, with median prices in Sydney roughly 50% higher than Melbourne, the Victorian capital is becoming \u201cmuch more affordable\u201d, Caine said. Lawless agreed, saying Melbourne was \u201cbuilding up a pretty solid competitive advantage from an affordability perspective\u201d. And despite the present investor gloom, annual rental yields in Victoria were \u201cactually higher than they\u2019ve ever been at the moment\u201d, at 3.8%, Caine said. The cycle of Melbourne lagging other cities might well prove temporary particularly when recent migrants start switching from renting to buying homes. Melbourne had jockeyed with Brisbane as Australia\u2019s second most expensive city behind Sydney for the past four or five decades, Caine said. \u201cThere\u2019s every likelihood that Melbourne will push back up and overtake Brisbane.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-01T13:00:03Z",
            "content": "For 55 years, the record label Sain, which is based in the north-west Wales village of Llandwrog, has been behind some of the most important Welsh-language music, promoting genres as diverse as pop, hip-hop, folk and classical. Now the painstaking process of digitising its sprawling back catalogue is under way to ensure that no gems are lost and, hopefully, to inspire future musicians. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a job,\u201d said Kev Tame, who is running the project. \u201cThey are in all kinds of different formats \u2013 CD, vinyl, original tape. There is an engineer at the studios digitising them all. There are more than 3,000 albums, singles and EPs \u2013 more than 26,000 tracks. It\u2019s really important to protect them for future generations.\u201d Some have already been added to commercial streaming platforms and all will be put on a digital repository at the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. Sain, Welsh for audio or sound, was co-founded in 1969 by the Welsh protest singer Dafydd Iwan, whose song Yma o Hyd (We\u2019re Still Here) has become an anthem for Wales football fans. Some early releases were recorded at Rockfield Studios in Monmouthshire, south-east Wales. The first single from the label was D\u0175r (Water), a protest song from Huw Jones about the flooding of the Welsh-speaking village of Capel Celyn to create a reservoir to provide water for Liverpool in 1965. Sain moved north in 1974 and artists who have recorded with the label include the indie favourite Catatonia, psych-folk musician Meic Stevens, poet and musician Geraint Jarman, the classical and opera star Bryn Terfel, and harpist and composer Catrin Finch. Collaborations and new recordings have been inspired by the project, including a deep dive into the Sain archive on a forthcoming new album by the Cardiff-based artist Don Leisure. The National Library of Wales will provide advice and support to Sain to ensure the archive is preserved digitally in the most accessible formats. Preservation began in January and will last a year. Tame said they had asked a few contacts for pieces they could not find. \u201cMost artists and contacts are very helpful. There is nothing missing yet.\u201d It comes at a good time for Welsh language music. Streaming has made music performed in Cymraeg much more accessible. \u201cAll over the world, people are open to the language being part of the sound they hear,\u201d Tames said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be in English for them to enjoy it.\u201d Financial support was provided from the Arfor challenge fund, a joint venture by Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, Gwynedd and Anglesey councils funded by the Welsh government, which seeks to use entrepreneurship and economic development to support the heartlands of the Welsh language and, thus, maintain the language. Iwan said: \u201cThis project will allow us to ensure that the musical output of the last half century will be available and accessible for future generations.\u201d Rhodri Llwyd Morgan, the chief executive of the National Library of Wales, said: \u201cThe Sain catalogue is one of our nation\u2019s most important music archives, chronicling Welsh cultural expression for over half a century.\u201d Three tracks from the Sain back catalogue available on Spotify Tacsi I\u2019r Tywyllwch (Taxi Into Darkness) A 1977 early release from Geraint Jarman, who was described by the Super Furry Animals singer Gruff Rhys as \u201cserving as a bridge to a new wave of post-punk Welsh-language artists in the 1980s and beyond who had a less self-conscious relationship with their Welsh identity\u201d. Gormod i\u2019w Golli (Too Much to Lose) A single by the Welsh rock/metal singer Rhiannon Tomos, who went on to front on to front the Welsh heavy metal band Y Diawled (The Devil). D\u0175r (Water) Huw Jones describes the feelings of a Welsh man returning to the valley of his childhood, only to find his people had been expelled and the land flooded to make a reservoir to supply water to England."

            "date": "2024-08-19T16:34:26Z",
            "content": "Marvin and Anita Johnson know who they are \u2013 a married, middle-aged Black couple who own a bed and breakfast in the Atlanta suburb of Stockbridge, Georgia. They also understand that when some guests arrive, it may be the first time they spend the night with Black hosts. So when people peruse the website of Stockbridge Lakes Bed &amp; Breakfast, they see images of a picturesque lake, lush landscaping and elegant bedrooms. They learn about the gourmet breakfasts, the sleeping porch and the paddle boats that guests are free to use. But they won\u2019t find any photos of the innkeepers. \u201cWe knew when we opened our doors who our market would be \u2013 mostly white people,\u201d said Marvin. Fearing their Black faces might deter potential guests, the Johnsons designed their website to promote the property\u2019s serene surroundings and amenities. \u201cThat was on purpose,\u201d said Anita. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to advertise that we were African Americans, and we didn\u2019t want [our clientele] to be limited to African Americans.\u201d According to a 2024 report from IBISWorld, traditional bed and breakfast lodging in the US is a $1.04bn industry, a sliver of the nation\u2019s $239bn hotel and motel market. Over the last decade, the rise of Airbnb and other short-term sublease rental platforms slowly ate away at traditional bed and breakfast businesses. But more recently, news of hidden cameras and hidden fees, and a slew of local regulations cracking down on short-term rentals, are breathing new life into the traditional bed and breakfast world. Anita, 57, grew up in Hawkinsville, Georgia, where her father was a pastor for the Church of God by Faith. As a teenager, she coordinated church events and trips. She eventually started a travel agency, handling group and corporate getaways. Meanwhile, Marvin, 65, had more than 35 years of experience in the automotive industry, including two decades in car dealership management and nearly as many in automotive financing. The pair married in 1998. In 2002, they participated in a Bible study on Rick Warren\u2019s best-selling book, The Purpose Driven Life. That\u2019s when they recognized that every job they had held \u2013 Anita in human resources, hotel management, travel companies; Marvin in criminal justice counseling and sales \u2013 put them on the path for a certain type of entrepreneurship. In 2003, the pair founded JS Venue Plus, a 20,000 sq ft event center in Morrow, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. The Johnsons see the bed and breakfast, which they opened in 2018, as an extension of their first co-founded business. Their inn, which is about a half-hour drive from Atlanta, is in a southern colonial-style house that sits on four acres with a lake stocked with bigmouth bass, catfish and turtles. Converting the home from a residence to a bed and breakfast was a two-year-long undertaking. The Johnsons had to add bathrooms to a couple of bedrooms and fix up a damp basement, which now offers 1,600 sq ft of recreational space. \u201cNot much transformation was needed in terms of the home itself,\u201d Anita said. \u201cSome renovations were needed to add our touch and become [accessible to people with disabilities].\u201d The biggest hurdle, she said, was working with the county to establish the first bed and breakfast in the area. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know how to categorize or regulate us,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we have become a staple of the community.\u201d With the dominance of Airbnb and hotel booking sites, why did you start a traditional bed and breakfast? Marvin: When we traveled, we always enjoyed the bed and breakfast experience. So we always liked meeting people. But not just the part of meeting people; we also liked what would happen, the attention that we would get and the service that we would get in that type of environment versus a hotel. You\u2019re starting to see some real pushback [against short-term rentals like Airbnb], especially from people who have their privacy exposed by hidden cameras. According to reports, most frequent visitors to traditional bed and breakfasts are over 55. How would you describe your clientele? Marvin: Our guests arrive to us twofold. Traveling guests are mostly white, over 45 and slightly more familiar with the bed and breakfast concept. Our local guests experiencing the B&amp;B for the first time trend younger and are of mixed demographics. Your bed and breakfast is near Atlanta, which has a significant African American population. But your pictures aren\u2019t on your website. Why not lean into being Black-owned? Marvin: It didn\u2019t make sense to promote our business as Black-owned or the first Black bed and breakfast in the county. Well, we\u2019re the only bed and breakfast [in the county], and we did not need to do all that. We need to promote the bed and breakfast, our service and all we have to offer. How much of your decision not to reveal your ethnicity was influenced by the region in which you live? Marvin: We cater to travelers, so we need people from all over the place. We\u2019re in the south, so we know where people are driving from; that\u2019s the Panhandle of Florida, out of Alabama. These are also people who like to stay at a bed and breakfast. And we expect those kinds of people to be Caucasian. The question is what they will expect when they walk through the door. Has there ever been an issue in which guests have arrived and been shocked that you were Black? Marvin: It\u2019s always, always an issue. It comes up, but we\u2019re prepared to handle it. If you see our reviews, we get five stars."

            "content": "There is an aura of assertiveness about Michele Kang, as she walks through the reception area of a central London hotel. It is there again in her handshake, then it is most prominent when she is soon calmly, yet enthusiastically, explaining her firm belief that investing in women\u2019s sports makes total business sense. She has already put her money where her mouth is. A couple of weeks ago, the owner of Washington Spirit in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, Lyon\u2019s women\u2019s team and London City Lionesses announced a $50m (\u00a339m) investment to improve female athletes\u2019 health. In the same week, after seeing the USA\u2019s women\u2019s rugby sevens team win Olympic bronze at a packed Stade de France, on the spur of the moment she pledged a further $4m in a bid to see them win gold in Los Angeles. \u201cYes, that was an expensive game for me,\u201d she says, jokingly but her tone is deadly serious when she says she is \u201cvery, very surprised\u201d that a lot more investors did not put their money in before her. \u201cI\u2019m on a mission to prove that women\u2019s sports is good business,\u201d says the South Korea-born Kang, whose Spirit host Arsenal Women in a pre-season friendly in the US capital on Sunday. \u201cThe gap between where it is and what it could be, is huge. I\u2019m flabbergasted that no one saw that. \u201cThis is not charity. Absolutely not. This is a serious investment. As a woman, I think it\u2019s almost insulting that these world-class athletes are being considered by some people as some sort of \u2018DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] project\u2019. No, I want to apply my business skills to solve these problems.\u201d To sit above the three women\u2019s football teams she owns, she has set up Kynisca Sports International Ltd, a multi-club ownership group, vowing that its new \u201cinnovation hub\u201d and centralised resources for research on specific female athletes\u2019 performance are a necessity for the women\u2019s game. The $50m pledge is a lot of cash but she points to the recent, rapid increase in sale prices for clubs in the NWSL, with valuations of between $2m and $5m a few years ago to Angel City\u2019s $250m valuation this year as a key indicator that women\u2019s sports will be profitable. \u201cThe growth has been exponential. This is not somebody\u2019s PowerPoint presentation. The proof is there.\u201d She had never attended a women\u2019s rugby game before seeing what she labelled as \u201cunbelievably engaged fans\u201d at that bronze medal match in Paris, nor had she attended any professional women\u2019s football matches until after the Covid pandemic. Women\u2019s sport was not, she says, originally part of her career plan. A keen tennis player in her youth, she moved to the US as a student and won awards for entrepreneurship and enjoyed lucrative success in the medical technology industry and venture capitalism, but now her motivations \u2013 as well as being financial \u2013 are based on a desire to improve things for young women. \u201cI\u2019m an immigrant and I was lucky enough to realise my American dream. So it\u2019s my turn to provide the opportunity,\u201d she says with passion. \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee an equal outcome, but I want to provide equal opportunity, and then the rest is up to you. I want more people, especially underprivileged, under\u2011resourced young people, to be able to achieve their dream. \u201cI\u2019ve seen incredibly talented young girls and women have to give up their dreams because there\u2019s no viable professional career path \u2013 too many girls drop out of sport right before college or when menstruation comes at 11, 12, so I want to provide an environment where young women can pursue their dreams without any constraints, just like the next-door boy would have.\u201d And when she says \u201ceveryone\u201d, she means in every corner of the globe. For now, her new multi-club ownership group is just three-teams strong, all in football, but asked if Kynisca might branch out into other women\u2019s sports she says \u201ceventually, probably\u201d, and then when asked how many football clubs around the world she wants to own, she says: \u201cI don\u2019t know [how many] but I definitely want to have one in each continent, and that\u2019s not about greed or vanity. I don\u2019t want girls around the world to watch on TV and say: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s just an English, French, American phenomenon.\u2019 I\u2019ll bring exactly the same thing everywhere so they can see it\u2019s in their backyard and within their reach. That\u2019s one of the major drivers for expanding globally.\u201d After buying into Spirit in 2020 and taking over in 2022, in May last year she acquired a majority stake in the eight-time Champions League winners Lyon. The third part of Kang\u2019s global expansion came last December, when she purchased the English second-tier side London City Lionesses. They were a bottom\u2011half club last term with rather modest turnouts, but Kang has snapped up Paris Saint\u2011Germain\u2019s head coach, Jocelyn Pr\u00eacheur, and signed a flurry of players including the Sweden veteran Kosovare Asllani. Kang has moved the team to Bromley for the new season and announced plans to build a \u201cworld-class\u201d dedicated training centre in Kent. Many outsiders may be asking, why choose the relatively unknown London City Lionesses? \u201cThe first and primary reason was, it\u2019s independent,\u201d says Kang, who has come straight from a meeting with the training ground architects. \u201cSpinning off a women\u2019s team that\u2019s part of a men\u2019s team is a very complicated deal. \u201cSecond, \u2018London\u2019, the fact that the name is \u2018London City\u2019, that\u2019s huge in my opinion, and in the London City area there\u2019s really no football presence there so it\u2019s really right for us to go in and take that as the future.\u201d Kang, who has said that her long-term target is to win the Women\u2019s Super League, knows larger broadcast deals will be key to the future profitability of the women\u2019s leagues, but concludes defiantly with an insight drawn from the Women\u2019s National Basketball Association. \u201cIf you look at men\u2019s sports, if you take the media money out, there aren\u2019t that many teams that are profitable,\u201d she says. \u201cNow look at the deal the WNBA just made. It\u2019s going to happen. The numbers are there for women\u2019s football, it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-11T11:00:12Z",
            "content": "Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of certification options \u2013 those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage. Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition. \u201cI tried to apply to some of the more established \u2018minority certifying agencies\u2019 and they told me that I was out of luck,\u201d says Alexander Harik, the co-founder, along his mom, Lorraine George-Harik, of Zesty Z, a pita chip company based in Brooklyn, New York. Although Harik was born in the US, his lineage is 100% Lebanese, yet he recounts being told: \u201cYou\u2019re Caucasian. We don\u2019t recognize that as a minority.\u201d Harik notes that he doesn\u2019t feel white. \u201cI\u2019ve had people say very racist and discriminatory things towards me,\u201d he says. \u201cOur experience is definitely different,\u201d he says of fellow Mena business owners, compared with white or Caucasian business owners who might be of European heritage. Harik is one of two dozen business owners of Mena heritage who are now certified through the nascent ADC Business Council\u2019s minority certification program launched by the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in July 2023. Yassin Sibai, born in Syria, also didn\u2019t qualify for a minority certification prior to the ADC\u2019s new program. Sibai is the co-founder of Afia, a frozen food company based in Austin, Texas, alongside his wife Farrah Moussallati Sibai. Afia makes falafel and kibbeh based on Syrian family recipes, which sell at supermarkets across the US. When Sibai had previously applied to various organizations to be certified, there was either no Mena box to check, or if he wrote \u201cMiddle Eastern\u201d on a blank line option, he got rejected over and over. Sibai also tried a self-certifying option through the SBA website that he had to print out himself. But approaching supermarket buyers with printouts in hand was often met with confusion \u2013 some buyers accepted it, others did not. \u201cMena was a much-needed certification that legitimizes us with the retailers,\u201d says Sibai. Brothers Mansour and Karim Arem tried explaining to the NMSDC that their Tunisian-rooted food company Zw\u00efta, based in Houston, Texas, is a minority-owned brand. They were rejected. \u201cAnybody from north Africa or the Middle East is just considered white under the categories that they had,\u201d says Karim. \u201cThat was a bit frustrating.\u201d Zw\u00efta, known for its harissas and shakshukas, is now Mena-certified through the ADC. While it\u2019s not necessary for minority-owned businesses in the US that sell goods or services to be certified (many aren\u2019t), for small, independent CPG (consumer packaged goods) brands, certification can reduce the cost of doing business significantly \u2013 sometimes by thousands of dollars. Several supermarket chains charge a fee for products sold on their shelves and some will reduce or waive those fees for certified businesses as part of their diversity efforts. Raffi Vartanian is the co-founder of Ziba, a company that sells nuts and dried fruits from Afghanistan and employs Afghan women. The colorful Ziba pouches sell at chains like Erewhon and Ralph\u2019s in California, and smaller shops like the Goods Mart in New York City. Shelving fees are \u201conerous\u201d for small brands, says Vartanian: \u201cYou\u2019re competing against huge conglomerates that can afford the shelf space.\u201d In addition to possibly reducing or eliminating fees, some supermarkets allocate funds for promotions during Black history or Asian American and Pacific Islander heritage months. \u201cApril is a newly recognized Mena heritage month,\u201d says Isabella \u201cBella\u201d Hughes of Better Sour, a gummy candy brand. Better Sour features flavors that reflect Hughes and co-founder Semira Nikou\u2019s Iranian American upbringings in Hawaii, like tangy pomegranate, apricot and plum. \u201cSo even if [stores aren\u2019t] scaling the slotting fees,\u201d says Hughes, \u201cat least they\u2019re highlighting us.\u201d Perks offered by supermarkets are not just altruistic overtures to CPG companies \u2013 they also benefit consumers, especially members of gen Z, who tend to like global flavors and foods more than previous generations and purchase accordingly. So far, approximately two dozen Mena-owned brands have been certified through the ADC program during this early soft launch phase. Many more such as Yaza Labneh, a new tangy Lebanese-style labneh sold in Whole Foods, are in the pipeline. Abed Ayoub, the executive director of the ADC who spearheaded its Mena certification program, is preparing for the next phase: tapping into the 25,000 business owners in the community, from construction and beauty service providers to lawyers and restaurateurs. Ayoub began exploring Arab or Mena certification as far back as 2009. After a few dead ends, starts and stops, he was re-energized during the pandemic as he saw vast numbers of entrepreneurs launch new businesses, coupled with Zesty Z\u2019s Harik reaching out and sharing his attempt at certification. Constance Jones, the NMSDC\u2019s senior director of certification, notes that the council launched in the early 1970s. \u201cAt that time,\u201d says Jones, Mena business owners \u201cdid not consider themselves to be minority, therefore we did not certify them as minority\u201d. Jones concedes that anti-Arab and anti-Muslim discrimination followed after 9/11. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t why NMSDC was created,\u201d states Jones. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t created to start adopting communities that had just now started to be discriminated [against]. It was always focused on the historical discrimination that happened in the United States for those populations that had been here.\u201d The subject of expanding the definition of minorities to include Mena ethnicities has come up regularly at the NMSDC, Jones says. A strategy committee is slated to look at expanding the council\u2019s definition in 2025 \u2013 not exactly a pressing matter. Parsing out who is considered eligible for a minority certification, and who is not, can get ridiculous verging on creepy \u2013 especially for regions with a history of migration and large immigrant populations. Is it based on DNA? Family tree? Appearance? Skin hue? Country of origin? The definitions for Hispanic, for example, vary among certifying organizations. For the NMSDC, certification requires at least one grandparent to be of a race that\u2019s been discriminated against in the US. So far, Ayoub says the ADC criteria for Mena certification includes examining passports, where applicants were born and family trees. \u201cAs long as we have a way to prove that connection,\u201d states Ayoub. So far, they\u2019ve had \u201ceasy cases\u201d, according to Ayoub, and they\u2019re trying to avoid scenarios in which there is need to determine if someone is \u201cMiddle East enough\u201d. He adds: \u201cIt\u2019s in the very early stages; we are taking it case by case.\u201d The new Mena certification is fairly unknown so there hasn\u2019t been a chance for any of the activists looking to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs to slam it as unfair to other ethnic groups. \u201cWe know it\u2019s coming,\u201d says Ayoub. \u201cA lot of people have made DEI the boogeyman at this point.\u201d Hughes, an investor who is on her third CPG company, says DEI initiatives are simply addressing past exclusions of minority groups. \u201cOn the back of our packaging, we say we\u2019re Iranian American founders from Hawaii. When we were little girls in the late 80s, early 90s, there was virtually zero representation,\u201d she adds. \u201cWhere does capital go? Who has access to capital?\u201d asks Hughes rhetorically. \u201cI mean, we do know.\u201d She answers: \u201cWomen [founders, solely] get 2% of all venture capital, period. Mena [founders]: 0.7%,\u201d referring to a March 2024 Carta report that polled those who identify as Middle Eastern/Arab. The Mena certification became official three months prior to Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel and Israel\u2019s subsequent retaliation, which has caused political and cultural reverberations around the globe. Israel is a Mena country, so will Israeli-owned businesses be eligible for Mena certification through the ADC? \u201cWhat I say is, have them apply,\u201d says Ayoub, \u201cand we\u2019ll go through the process.\u201d It\u2019s early days, but so far, no Israeli-owned businesses have applied for Mena certification. \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss politics,\u201d says Ayoub of Mena businesses that have applied for certification, which he says is all about economic empowerment. \u201cWe are strictly looking at a set of standards they have to meet to get the certification.\u201d While some Mena-certified business owners have one-on-one discussions about Gaza and Israel, they believe politics should be left out of the official process. \u201cThis is non-religious, not nationalistic\u201d says Zesty Z\u2019s Harik about the certification. \u201cThis is about making money.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a broad group of cultures, races, ethnicities, religions,\u201d says Hughes of the Mena region. \u201cSo for us, the mission is really as narrow as: let\u2019s raise awareness. Let\u2019s make sure in this industry we have proper representation. It\u2019s nothing related to the politics at play.\u201d All Mena religions, ethnicities and races are welcome to apply. The ADC\u2019s Mena certification information will eventually move to the Arab American Employee Resource Group website. \u201cWe want to separate the policy and politics from the business,\u201d says Ayoub, as the ADC advocates for Arab civil rights in the US. \u201cI don\u2019t want a company, whether it\u2019s Microsoft, to have to even think twice about teaming up with our organization because they disagree with our position.\u201d There will be a Mena box to check on the next 2030 census for the first time, which Ayoub thinks will dovetail with wider-spread acceptance of the Mena business certification; eventually Mena-certified business owners should be eligible to bid on local and federal contracts, like other minority business enterprises. It remains to be seen if supermarkets will accept a Mena certification. Stores choose if they want diversity programs and how they should be run; there is no regulatory requirement. \u201cBeing Mena-certified is one thing,\u201d says Sibai. \u201cThe retailers acknowledging it and accepting it as part of their diversity portfolio or education is a whole completely different kind of journey that we have to go through.\u201d Harik thinks the new Mena certification is all about the spirit of entrepreneurship. \u201cOpportunities were closed from us, so we got scrappy and intelligent and we just did our own thing. And it\u2019s working.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-04T09:00:28Z",
            "content": "Do women lack ambition?\u201d the Harvard Business Review asked 20 years ago, like a misogynist comedian wondering if women can be funny. But do we? Do I? It\u2019s complicated. I internalised the gen X contempt for visible striving early and we joked about the one openly ambitious girl at school (she\u2019s now a CEO whose \u00a33.2m pay package I read about this year; the joke\u2019s on me). My professional life started aimlessly, in a job I hated; I had two children in quick succession at least partly to get time off work. I was nearly 35 before I accepted and acted on my deeply repressed ambition \u2013 to write \u2013 then tackled it with a white-hot determination that came at real detriment to my personal life. Now 49, my work excites and challenges me, but I\u2019m also conflicted. I\u2019m constantly anxious, stressed and comparing myself unfavourably to my peers. My hips ache from all the desk hours; I wish I was fitter and had more time to read, garden and see friends. My slightly older husband has a better work-life balance and I sometimes look up from my laptop to see him heading off to do something fun and fulfilling and think: \u2018Is this really what I want, and if so, why?\u2019 A new book, Fair or Foul: The Lady Macbeth Guide to Ambition, addresses those questions in a thought- provoking set of reflections framed around, arguably, the most ambitious woman in the literary canon. \u201cMost of us at some point or another have a crossroads moment,\u201d says its author Stefan Stern when we speak. \u201cWe\u2019re faced with \u2018how much do I really want this?\u2019\u201d Stern has a lifelong obsession with the play and its exploration of ambition gone wrong. He chose to frame his thoughts around Lady Macbeth, he says, because she represents that dilemma most clearly. He quotes from her first soliloquy, addressed to a vacillating Macbeth: \u201cThou wouldst be great, / art not without ambition, but without / The illness should attend it.\u201d \u201cThose lines still make me shudder,\u201d Stern says. \u201cThat\u2019s the most difficult or the biggest challenge of all ambition: do you have to be a bit crazy, a bit unhinged?\u201d It\u2019s something he\u2019s wondered himself throughout his life and the book examines that question for both men and women through a Lady Macbeth lens. I wonder if as a male author, he felt any hesitation about this approach. Stern says yes, but the book is partly his attempt to rehabilitate the character. \u201cThe clich\u00e9 of the scheming Lady Macbeth figure persists; any successful or healthily ambitious woman risks being labelled in that way by insecure men who feel threatened.\u201d In fact, Lady Macbeth demonstrates \u201ca more sophisticated understanding of human nature and society than she is often given credit for,\u201d Stern argues, and the questions the character embodies \u2013 is ambition a kind of derangement, and is it, actually, bad for us? \u2013 are as relevant now as ever. Those questions resonate differently for women. Female ambition has often been considered unnatural and inappropriate (Stern highlights a \u201cwhole dictionary\u201d of words used only for ambitious women, never men: bossy, feisty, pushy, shrill). In Lady Macbeth\u2019s famous \u201cunsex me here\u201d speech, Stern says, she expresses the need to discard femininity to do what needs to be done (he points to Elizabeth Holmes and her Steve Jobs-aping outfits as evidence that impulse persists). \u201cIt anticipates all these future discussions about how an ambitious woman should present herself to the world and conduct herself, and what the world will say.\u201d Jennifer Romolini knows something about that. On her graft-fuelled rise through the ranks of noughties publishing and digital media to C-suite jobs and global recognition, Romolini encountered a great deal of gender-specific unease at her unapologetic ambition. Her new memoir, Ambition Monster, includes numerous examples of men with her kind of burning ambition being treated quite differently. \u201cThe ease with which men walked into jobs, walked through jobs, the amount of judgment and attention given to a woman\u2019s behaviour was entirely different,\u201d she tells me. \u201cMy behaviour was constantly monitored and criticised and my \u2018bedside manner\u2019 was a problem. The way I was behaving was not inappropriate per se, but it was inappropriate for what we understand a woman to be able to do.\u201d Some of that criticism came from other women, one of whom describes her, with evident distaste, as \u201csuch a careerist\u201d. That tallies with the research findings of the author of that provocatively titled (and far more thoughtful than the splashy title) Harvard Business Review article, psychiatrist Anna Fels: \u201cThe women I interviewed,\u201d Fels writes, \u201chated the very word. For them, \u2018ambition\u2019 necessarily implied egotism, selfishness, self-aggrandisement, or the manipulative use of others for one\u2019s own ends.\u201d It\u2019s a characterisation of ambition that also makes Viv Groskop, the author of Lift as You Climb: Women and the Art of Ambition, angry. Groskop is happy to be described as ambitious (her many achievements \u2013 books, radio, standup, TV, a podcast featuring the likes of Hillary Clinton and Margaret Atwood \u2013 are testament to that), but became frustrated by how ambition had \u201cbecome owned by really terrible, self-interested people\u201d. The book was, she says, in part an attempt to reframe women\u2019s ambition as mutually supportive and compassionate and reclaim it from \u201cbombastic\u201d and dated clich\u00e9s. \u201cI think we recognise these tropes \u2013 the shoulder-padded bitch, the Queen Bee \u2013 but they are ridiculous and have no relevance to real life.\u201d Their history is interesting though. After first-wave feminism, two world wars bringing women into the workplace and the pill, the \u201cshoulder-padded bitch\u201d of the 1980s was a watershed moment for female ambition. For Annie Auerbach, founder of trends agency Starling and author of Flex: Reinventing Work for a Smarter, Happier Life, it was \u201can embattled era of ambition\u201d, characterised by rocketing levels of female full-time employment, Helen Gurley Brown\u2019s Having It All, the film Working Girl and \u201cwomen defiantly taking up space\u201d. It evolved through the girl-power 90s, emerging as the much-derided noughties #girlboss. For all its superficial, Swarovski-coated vapidity, the girlboss era had a clear narrative that women could be ambitious without \u201cunsexing\u201d themselves and it did, I think, move the needle. A friend, S, who has a big job in publishing says girlbossing made a real impact on her 20s; a much younger PhD student tells me: \u201cIt was never really a serious thing, more of a meme to us,\u201d but also says she and her friends \u201cdon\u2019t really care if we\u2019re seen as \u2018excessive\u2019 or \u2018unseemly\u2019\u201d, which is surely at least partly a product of that course correction. But the \u201cyou go girl\u201d rhetoric felt simultaneously cynical and empty \u2013 it became another way for women to feel they were failing. Romolini is ferociously funny and righteously angry about her experiences at the sharp end of this \u201csocially sanctioned #bossbitch bootcamp\u201d and the way it was co-opted and exploited in organisations that often remained male-led: \u201cI am complicit in selling a narrow, convenient, overinflated narrative about women and work that I am beginning to know is \u2013 at least in my experience \u2013 a lie,\u201d she writes. By the 2010s, the post-financial crisis exhortations to grind and #leanin (Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s book of the same title was published in 2013) created, Auerbach says, a sort of \u201cproductivity porn, with relentless self-promotion\u2026 the only way to offset precarity\u201d. Covid was an inflection point of sorts, when mothers\u2019 unprecedented burnout and declining mental health provoked an existential reckoning, perhaps expressed most clearly around former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s resignation in 2023. We have come a long way, but I\u2019m not sure exactly where we are. This feels like an age of ambivalence around ambition, especially for women; a time of #lazygirljobs, #softlifegirlies and the reframing of rest as a radical act. \u201cThe girlboss is dead, long live the girl moss (lying on the floor of the forest and being absorbed back into nature),\u201d reads one meme that hit hard. I feel that ambivalence and I see it around me. A self-described \u201crecovering academic\u201d is reassessing her attitude to ambition beyond that ultra-competitive environment; a senior civil servant has lost her single-minded drive since having kids, which makes her \u201ca bit sad\u201d. A bakery owner I admire hugely says she started out \u201cfull of ambition and energy. I had to be a girlboss and ambitious with a new bakery and baby solo.\u201d Now she\u2019s drawn to the \u201csoft girl life\u201d and her allotment: \u201cI no longer have any interest in scaling the bakery, calling myself the founder\u2026 I dream of homesteads and field bakeries.\u201d My absurdly talented friend, whose ambition was stolen by long Covid says: \u201cI\u2019m kind of glad, because ambition is meaningless.\u201d It seems to me that much of the ambivalence I hear from women about ambition, and the appeal of anti-striving memes, comes from a sense of being failed by late-stage capitalist patriarchy. Because at no point in the evolving story of female ambition have we managed to demolish the structural barriers to women realising theirs. I hardly need to set them out, but 54 years since the Equal Pay Act we haven\u2019t reached parity, which aside from any cultural or biological bias toward women as caregivers, means it\u2019s still often economically sensible for them to become default primary carers in heterosexual relationships; we\u2019re also in an acute childcare crisis in the UK. \u201cThe \u2018soft life\u2019 is a pushback against the idea that successful women are resilient women,\u201d says Auerbach. \u201cResilience told us your value as a woman was to say yes, suck it up, be \u2018fierce\u2019, hustle harder. Society praises resilience, because then it doesn\u2019t have to change.\u201d When aspiration hits the buffers of structural barriers, what often follows is burnout. Romolini experienced that as she struggled to achieve her ambitions for both motherhood and professional success, and so did founder and writer Sharmadean Reid. In many ways, Reid was a girlboss archetype: she founded the groundbreaking WAH Nails salon and became the first Black woman in the UK to raise \u00a31m in venture capital for her second entrepreneurial project, but the personal cost that exacted \u2013 anxiety, intense stress \u2013 prompted her to reassess hustle culture. She\u2019s coolly forensic about the way it exalts entrepreneurship and leadership: \u201cWe\u2019ve had power bitch, we\u2019ve had girl power, we\u2019ve had girlboss, but they\u2019re all the same thing: it\u2019s a neoliberal self-actualisation through work or money\u2026 women have felt that they can be part of it if they go out and grind like everyone else.\u201d Stepping back from that to make personal changes and interrogate the stubborn societal barriers that stop women from acting on their ambition, without setting their whole lives on fire, has informed her book of essays, New Methods for Women. Friends Tiffany Scott and Alex Morgan encountered those barriers, too, as they navigated early motherhood simultaneously in 2020. Scott works in recruitment, Morgan in higher education; both consider themselves highly ambitious and their frequentconversations around how hard it was for the \u201cunpaid work\u201d of motherhood \u2013 the drudgery, the mental load \u2013 \u201cnot to completely derail your career\u201d as Morgan puts it, became their Mambition podcast. What they mainly realised as they interviewed other mothers (\u201creally successful career-minded people\u201d), they tell me, was that everyone struggles. The motherhood penalty has caused 250,000 women to leave the workforce, according to recent Fawcett Society research. \u201cI think people are turned off by \u2018having it all\u2019,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cBecause they realise how unfair it is.\u201d But things are changing, working models in particular. Covid lockdowns might have precipitated an existential crisis for many working mothers, but their legacy has been a seismic shift in how and where we (well, some of us) work. A 2023 McKinsey Women report found women were actually more ambitious post-Covid; that\u2019s a product of the chink of light flexible working practices let in. For Reid, the emergence of flexible and hybrid models is \u201calmost the equivalent of the pill\u2026 you really see there are alternative ways of working\u201d (though, she emphasises, for many women these models of working are still not accessible). Other things are changing, too: the UK gender pay gap is at its narrowest-ever point (91p in the pound) and shared parental leave is slowly becoming more common. Morgan mentions two friends who have taken it, including one who was the first in his engineering firm; my publishing friend\u2019s partner \u2013 a lawyer \u2013 did too. That McKinsey report found men want flexible working as well as women; they\u2019ve been pushed into roles that don\u2019t suit or fulfil them, just as women have. Another positive trend that emerges from all my discussions is that we\u2019re defining ambition more, I suppose, ambitiously. Stern sees a shifting focus to \u201cpersonal growth not career growth\u201d; we have life ambitions, not five-year plans. \u201cI haven\u2019t given up on ambition,\u201d says Romolini. \u201cI\u2019ve just redirected it so that I get what I actually want.\u201d \u201cWhat about self-actualisation through creativity or personal development?\u201d asks Reid. For Auerbach a life-centred, flexible way of working is \u201cone of the most ambitious things you can strive for\u201d. Groskop describes a new \u201caltruistic ambition\u201d and I see that in Reid, who is trying to effect at least a \u201cpinprick\u201d of structural change by exploring new economic models and micro-revolutions. Because ambition need not be a life-gobbling monster or an \u201cillness\u201d; it shouldn\u2019t have to destroy women, as it did Lady Macbeth. A friend says her gen-Z daughter and her female friends want, and believe they can have, family, leisure and fulfilling work without the sacrifices their mothers\u2019 generation made. I hope they\u2019re right. And I hope that the broader, bolder ambitions we\u2019re starting to express for our \u201cone wild and precious life\u201d will keep chipping away at everything that still holds us back."

            "content": "The UK\u2019s largest employers have warned the jobs market is cooling amid a slowdown in wage growth in July and a fall in vacancies, extending an almost two-year downturn in hiring demand for permanent staff. Figures from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and the accountancy firm KPMG showed a fall in permanent staff placements in July as large employers made more redundancies and hired fewer new starters. In a survey of 400 recruitment and employment consultancies, which is closely monitored by the Bank of England, the fall in staff appointments was mirrored by a slowdown in wage growth. While companies continued to increase pay rates to recruit suitable candidates, which in some cases remained in short supply, wage growth fell slightly on the level recorded in June and was below the monthly trend. The Bank cut interest rates last week for the first time in more than four years, after inflation fell from the highest levels since the early 1980s back to the 2% target in May and June. Threadneedle Street has said it is watching for more evidence of a cooling jobs market, lower wage growth and a slowdown in price rises in the service sector of the economy before cutting interest rates again. The Bank has also said that resilient wage settlements and service sector price increases are likely to drive headline inflation above its 2% target within months, but that the measure is then likely to fall back to about 1.7% in two years\u2019 time, then to 1.5% in 2027. Financial markets expect the central bank to keep interest rates on hold at 5% when policymakers next meet on 19 September, before it resumes cutting them in November. City investors predict the base rate could then be cut to about 3.5% before the end of next year. According to the latest snapshot from the REC/KPMG report on jobs, which is compiled by S&amp;P Global, the number of vacancies fell in July while demand for hiring was subdued. There was also a reduction in temporary billings, although the rate of contraction was marginal. The survey showed recruiters were willing to raise pay to attract workers amid a \u201cdearth of suitable candidates\u201d. While it said wage inflation remained high relative to recent years, the report showed pay growth had slowed on the previous month. Temporary pay also increased, but only marginally, and at the weakest rate for almost three-and-a-half years. Kate Shoesmith, the deputy chief executive of the REC, said: \u201cThe weaker growth in both salaries and temp pay suggests that employers are keeping pay in line with inflation, as the Bank of England want, and the interest rate cut is welcome. Employers will need more of the same to maintain confidence.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-24T15:02:55Z",
            "content": "The Labour government\u2019s highly publicised plans to improve workers\u2019 rights and end years of stagnating wages, insecure jobs and in-work poverty are full of ambiguities and lack crucial detail, a leading thinktank on the future of work has concluded. A report by the Autonomy Institute, which promotes a fairer and more democratic economy, says the new deal for working people has the potential to move the UK\u2019s labour market on from a \u201clost decade\u201d of increasing exploitation, while at the same time playing a key role in Keir Starmer\u2019s mission to drive up economic growth. But it says \u201cquestions remain over many crucial details of the programme\u201d and that \u201cit will need to go further if it wishes to truly represent a meaningful agenda for reform\u201d. It insists that all the core commitments that Labour made in the run-up to the general election must be delivered \u201cin full without any more rollbacks\u201d when the employment right\u2019s bill is published later this year. Doubts were expressed about Labour\u2019s commitment to full delivery when it emerged earlier this year that the party had downgraded a pledge to put an end to all zero-hours contracts, and would instead ban only \u201cexploitative\u201d elements of the contracts. The institute also says Labour appears to have backtracked on a commitment to introduce a single \u201cworker\u201d status in order to end \u201cbogus self-employment\u201d, which allows employers to save on costs such as national insurance payments and paid holidays. It calls for more details on the setting up of a national care service to deliver a better deal for care workers. The report, published before the TUC\u2019s annual meeting next month and the party conference season, echoes the fears of many groups representing working people and the main unions, that Labour may renege on some of its promises after being heavily lobbied by business leaders fearful that its agenda will increase employment costs. The report includes new polling by Survation of 2,074 adults that shows only 24% of people believe all Labour\u2019s proposals will be implemented, while 76% think some of them will be introduced. Raising the minimum wage to a real living wage (\u00a312 an hour outside London and \u00a313.15 inside the capital) was ranked as the best element of the overall Labour package by 39% of respondents. Tackling insecure contracts was ranked top by 21% of those polled, while the \u201cright to switch off\u201d and not be contacted by employers out of work hours was the No 1 priority for 20%. Among plans not included in Labour\u2019s proposals, raising statutory sick pay to levels comparable with other similar nations and shortening the working week to 32 hours with no loss of pay were the most popular ideas. The institute said that the way in which some of Labour\u2019s proposals on increasing the rights of workers had been drawn up appeared to give too much power to employers to decide the terms and so risked diluting the potential benefits to employees. To ensure workers gain from Labour\u2019s \u201cright to switch off\u201d policy, the institute suggested imitating France and Portugal, where fines have been handed out to employers for going against legislation to protect workers from being contacted outside working hours. The Autonomy Institute also noted that popular and much needed policies on a shorter working week were absent, while detail on the levels of statutory sick pay were badly needed. It wants to see more detail in the employment right\u2019s bill, which the government has said will be introduced in its first 100 days in office. Will Stronge, director of research at the Autonomy Institute, said: \u201cAmbiguities in some of Labour\u2019s proposals to improve workers\u2019 rights leave uncertainty over the scope or effectiveness of the programme as a whole.\u201d A real opportunity to deliver improvement for working people existed, he said but added: \u201cTo ensure workers benefit, the new deal for working people must be delivered in full and without any more rollbacks when the employment right\u2019s bill is published later this year.\u201d A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said: \u201cOur plan to Make Work Pay sets out a significant and ambitious agenda to ensure workplace rights are fit for a modern economy, empower working people and deliver economic growth. This is a core part of this government\u2019s mission to grow the economy and raise living standards across the country. \u201cOur imminent employment rights bill will also deliver the biggest upgrade to rights at work for a generation and is a vital step in the delivery of the Make Work Pay plan. Work is also underway to identify ways to swiftly deliver measures through other mechanisms.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-29T17:14:13Z",
            "content": "Shares in the chip designer Nvidia have fallen after investors were spooked by signs of slowing growth and production issues, despite the artificial intelligence company posting a 122% rise in second-quarter revenues compared with the same period last year. The Silicon Valley company\u2019s revenues for the period more than doubled to $30bn (\u00a323bn), beating average analyst estimates of $28.7bn. However, investors were concerned about signs of a slowdown in growth, in particular around its next-generation AI chips, codenamed Blackwell. The stock fell as much as 7% in pre-market trading, before paring back losses to a 3.4% fall as of midday trading on New York\u2019s Nasdaq. The chipmaker is the third most valuable company in the world, with a market value of $3.1tn. The sudden drop in its share price wiped more than $100bn (\u00a376bn) from its stock market value. Nvidia\u2019s partial recovery after its early morning decline appeared to buoy other tech stocks and chipmakers during Thursday trading. Google, Apple and Amazon, as well as the chip designer Arm holdings, all saw their stock prices rise as of midday. Nvidia said the delivery of its Blackwell chips \u2013 which comprise 208bn transistors that carry out calculations to train its large language model \u2013 would be delayed by several months from January. Its chief executive, Jensen Huang, has previously said that Blackwell would generate \u201ca lot of revenue\u201d for the business this year. Simon French, the chief economist and head of research at the investment bank Panmure Liberum told the BBC: \u201cThere were just some signs around the edges in numbers that that rate of growth was trying to slow. Their current AI chip \u2018hopper\u2019 is selling well, but the next one, the next generation Blackwell, has faced some production delays, and that perhaps is one of the reasons why Wall Street, after hours, sold off the stock.\u201d Nvidia bosses did not detail the extent of the delay for Blackwell deliveries but said manufacturing issues had been addressed by TSMC, the Taiwanese semiconductor firm that builds the US company\u2019s most advanced chips. They added that early samples were now shipping to a small group of customers. The drop in Nvidia\u2019s share price dragged on US markets, in particular the S&amp;P 500 index. Nvidia makes up about 6% of the total value of the index and has helped drive its gains this year, after rising more than 160% over the past 12 months. Matt Britzman, an analyst at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said Nvidia was facing the challenge of how to match the hype. \u201cIt\u2019s less about just beating estimates now, markets expect them to be shattered and it\u2019s the scale of the beat that looks to have disappointed a touch.\u201d While many investors have bought into the theoretical impact of artificial intelligence and claims that it could transform nearly every global industry, French noted that the practical use cases \u201chaven\u2019t yet been proven\u201d. \u201cSuch are the lofty expectations for this stock, not just as a single company, but its broader economic impact. If you\u2019re going to raise expectations that high, then you\u2019ve got to keep growing at spectacular rates,\u201d he said. However, Britzman cautioned against reading too much into the market reaction, given that investors tended to \u201coverstate\u201d the importance of one set of quarterly results, particularly in the \u201cgrand scheme of AI\u201d prospects. Instead, he said companies such as Microsoft, Tesla and the Facebook and Instagram owner, Meta, were working on a \u201cmulti-year, even multi-decade, time frame and investors would be wise to adopt a similar mentality\u201d. He added: \u201cThe question of return on investment, that many AI bears [sceptics] fall back on, simply isn\u2019t the main consideration for Nvidia\u2019s biggest customers at this stage. Like many before, this cycle won\u2019t be a straight line, but while the \u2018build it and they will come\u2019 approach continues, it plays right into Nvidia\u2019s hands.\u201d"

But unenticing is not the same as unimportant. This is the official forecaster telling us what economic impact it expects public investment \u2013 public spending that creates an asset, like a road or hospital \u2013 to have. Policy debates normally focus on public investment\u2019s growth impact through the lens of what it does immediately to the demand side of the economy (for example, creating construction jobs, something particularly valuable in a recession). But that impact is mainly temporary (the OBR estimates it disappears after three years). So this unassuming paper focuses on what public investment does to the economy\u2019s supply side \u2013 not creating work today, but raising the UK\u2019s ability to produce goods and services tomorrow (for example, because we have a properly functioning transport system). It finds \u201ca sustained 1% of GDP increase in public investment could plausibly increase the level of potential output by just under 0.5% after five years and around 2.5% in the long run.\u201d The lessons? Not just the obvious one that investment is a long game, given that building takes time and the flow of new investment is small v the stock of public sector assets. But the impact isn\u2019t just long term. It\u2019s big. That 2.5% compares to the 4% estimated economic hit from Brexit. Of course, it matters what you invest in and whether projects are delivered on time and budget (unlike HS2).

            "date": "2024-08-18T23:01:41Z",
            "content": "The first Bank of England rate cut in four years has triggered an immediate upturn in the UK property market, as cheaper mortgages prompt interest among buyers and drive up house prices. Figures from the property website Rightmove show the number of potential buyers contacting estate agents about homes for sale since 1 August jumped by 19% compared with the same time a year ago. Contacts in July were up 11% on the previous year. The Bank cut interest rates on 1 August for the first time since the start of the Covid pandemic, easing pressure on households after it had raised borrowing costs to the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis to tackle soaring inflation. It cut its key base rate from 5.25% to 5%, after a fall in inflation back to more normal levels this year. Figures last week showed inflation rose to 2.2% in July, above the Bank\u2019s 2% target. However, it remains significantly lower than a peak of 11.1% two years ago after the Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered a surge in energy prices. Rightmove said the Bank cutting borrow costs had helped to accelerate the availability of cheaper mortgages from high street lenders, alongside contributing \u201csignificantly\u201d to improved buyer demand. It said future Bank rate cuts would establish a buoyant autumn property market, and it upgraded its house price forecasts from a 1% drop over the whole of 2024 to a 1% rise in new seller asking prices. Financial markets widely expect that the Bank will react to fading inflationary pressures by cutting rates further, possibly to as low as 3.5% by the end of next year. The Bank is expected to keep rates on hold at its next meeting in September before restarting reductions in borrowing costs in November. Andrew Bailey, the Bank\u2019s governor, is expected to speak at the annual US gathering of central bank policymakers at the Rocky Mountains resort of Jackson Hole on Friday. Rightmove said the average new seller asking price had fallen this month by 1.5%, or by \u00a35,708, to \u00a3367,785. Prices typically fall in August from July during the quieter months for the property market. The fall was in line with the long-term average for the last 18 years. \u201cAs the summer holiday season comes to an end, the conditions are there for a more active autumn market,\u201d said Tim Bannister, Rightmove\u2019s director of property science. \u201cThe reaction from home-movers to what is hopefully only the first of several rate cuts over the next year or two, combined with other positive data and trends, has led us to raise our price prediction for the year.\u201d The figures come as high street lenders reduce the borrowing costs on new mortgages in anticipation of the central bank lowering interest rates. Rightmove said the average five-year fixed-rate mortgage was now 4.80% \u2013 still higher than three years ago, before the first of 14 consecutive Bank rate increases, but significantly down from 5.82% at this point in 2023. The latest figure is the lowest since around Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget in September 2022. Estate agents said that alongside the Bank cutting rates, increased political certainty after Labour\u2019s general election landslide in July and a brighter economic outlook were also helping with buyer interest. Josephine Ashby, a managing partner at John Bray Estate Agents in Cornwall, said: \u201cThere is no doubt that activity slowed in the buildup to the general election despite a result that was no great surprise to the country. With the election now behind us we are seeing an improvement in buyer engagement as more certainty in the political and economic landscapes forms.\u201d However, borrowing costs are still higher than three years ago, while housing affordability remains stretched for millions of families. Tom Bill, the head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, said: \u201cMarkets are pricing in a further cut in 2024, which means transaction volumes should be stronger this autumn than last year. That said, uncertainty surrounding the budget and wave of people rolling off favourable mortgage deals will keep a lid on price growth, which we expect to be 3% in the UK this year.\u201d"

            "content": "The Bank of England is braced for a knife-edge decision on interest rates as policymakers consider whether to cut borrowing costs for the first time since the start of the Covid pandemic. After a sharp fall in inflation this year, Threadneedle Street is poised for a first reduction in borrowing costs since ratcheting up interest rates from a record low of 0.1% in December 2021 to the current level of 5.25%. Financial markets predict a quarter-point cut to 5% on Thursday, although the decision is expected to be a close call, with some economists warning the central bank could hold off until its next policy meeting in September. Official figures from June show headline inflation remained at the 2% target for a second consecutive month, having fallen from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022 at the height of the cost of living crisis after the Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered a surge in energy prices. Threadneedle Street has said its decision will rest on whether price growth in the service sector of the economy is slowing, and whether Britain\u2019s jobs market is cooling to levels consistent with keeping inflation near the 2% government target. Wage growth slowed in May to the lowest level in two years and unemployment remained unchanged, while the number of vacancies dropped by 30,000 amid fading hiring demand in retail and hospitality. However, economists have warned that stubborn pressures in the domestic economy remain, after the UK recorded a stronger than expected recovery from recession in the first quarter of the year. Three members of the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee have voiced concern over persistent inflationary pressures, including the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Huw Pill. \u201cI think it\u2019s still an open question on whether the timing for a rate cut is now,\u201d he said earlier this month. However, Swati Dhingra, consistently one of the most dovish members of the MPC, warned this month that it was time for the Bank to \u201cstop squeezing living standards\u201d and cut interest rates. Financial markets have been on a rollercoaster in the past month, reflecting the difficulty in predicting a close decision. City economists expect the MPC to be split by five votes to four in favour of a cut, with the governor, Andrew Bailey, holding the casting vote. Pricing in financial markets reflected a 65% probability of a cut on Wednesday evening. Analysts said the Bank was likely to upgrade its growth forecasts in its latest monetary policy report, after a stronger than expected performance in recent months. The UK exited last year\u2019s brief recession in the first quarter, before a brief setback in April when growth stalled, before stronger than anticipated growth of 0.4% month on month in May. Kathleen Brooks, research director at the financial trading platform XTB, said: \u201cWe think it would be unusual for the Bank of England to cut rates and upgrade its growth forecasts at the same meeting. Thus, this decision for the Bank of England is too tough to call, in our view, and we expect markets to be volatile around this decision.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-30T12:14:02Z",
            "content": "Eurozone inflation fell this month to its lowest since June 2021, adding to the case for the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut interest rates in September. Inflation in the single currency bloc dropped to 2.2% in August, down from 2.6% in July, and barely above the ECB\u2019s 2% target. The ECB, led by Christine Lagarde, is weighing up whether to cut interest rates at its next meeting on 12 September. In June it cut its main interest rate from 4% to 3.75%, the first downwards move since 2019. Central bankers around the world are trying to engineer \u201csoft landings\u201d \u2013 bringing inflation below target while avoiding recession. The Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, last week said \u201cthe time has come\u201d for lower interest rates in the US, although the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, has warned he is hesitant to cut rates too quickly. The expected round of interest rate cuts comes as the bout of price increases during the chaos of the Covid pandemic has faded. Supply chains were disrupted by pandemic lockdowns, leading to steep price rises, before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine caused global energy prices to soar. In August it was falling energy inflation that had the biggest effect on dragging Europe\u2019s harmonised index of consumer prices down, according to Eurostat, the EU\u2019s data agency. Core inflation, which strips out the more volatile components including energy prices, dropped slightly from 2.9 to 2.8%, but services inflation ticked up from 4% to 4.2% as hosting the Olympic Games in Paris pushed up French services prices. Bert Colijn, a senior economist for the eurozone at Dutch investment bank ING, said he did not expect core inflation to drop below 2.5% for the rest of the year. \u201cThe ECB has arrived on a long home straight when it comes to bringing inflation back to target,\u201d Colijn said. He added that the modest decline in inflationary pressures and expectations for slowing inflation next year should be enough to persuade the ECB to cut rates in September. However, he also said: \u201cThis remains a slow and gradual process of releasing the brakes on the economy as the ECB continues to be concerned about upside risks to the inflation outlook.\u201d Eurozone unemployment also edged down unexpectedly from 6.5% to 6.4%. Central bankers tend to be wary of cutting interest rates when unemployment is falling because it can be a sign of shortages of workers that could lead to inflationary pressures building. Transactions on financial markets on Friday implied that a cut to the ECB\u2019s main interest rate of 0.25 percentage points is a near certainty, with two more expected before the end of the year. Sam Miley, the forecasting lead at the Centre for Business and Economics Research, warned that \u201cthe higher rate of core inflation and continually tight labour market will present risk factors to implementing looser monetary policy\u201d."

Look for offers Many lenders offer incentives like cashback deals, free legal services and property valuations for first-time buyers. Some aim to attract borrowers with small deposits, like Yorkshire building society\u2019s \u00a35,000 deposit mortgage, which offers up to 99% loan-to-value (LTV) if you have at least \u00a35,000 saved. And Skipton\u2019s track record mortgage will lend you up to 100% of the price of a home if you can show you have being paying your rent every month \u2013 the monthly mortgage payment must come to the same or less than your monthly rent. Pick what suits you One of the biggest choices is between a fixed rate, which will remain the same for a set period, or a tracker mortgage, with a rate which rises and (more helpfully) falls with the Bank of England\u2019s base rate. It\u2019s a very personal choice, Hollingworth says: \u201cIf knowing what you\u2019re going to pay each month is important, then you\u2019re going to be looking at a fixed rate \u2013 and then it\u2019s a question of how long you want to lock in for.\u201d Currently, a lot of five-year fixed-rate deals come with lower interest rates than their two-year equivalents (Nationwide building society\u2019s best rate for a five-year fix for home movers is now 3.83%, while the equivalent two-year deal has a rate of 4.35%). With interest rates heading downwards, Hollingworth says many borrowers are considering shorter-term deals, even though they cost a little more, in the hope rates will have come down in a couple of years when it\u2019s time to look for a new one. \u201cThe trouble is,\u201d he says, \u201cno one knows exactly what is going to happen with interest rates, so it really comes down to what you feel most comfortable with.\u201d Choosing a deal based on what know is going on in your life may make more sense than second-guessing the Bank of England. Perhaps you are due to pay off other debts, which will leave you able to pay more towards your mortgage in a couple of years, or your status as a borrower might change. \u201cIf you buy now at 95% loan-to-value, in two years\u2019 time, you may find yourself in the 90% LTV bracket, meaning more attractive interest rates will be available to you. Those kinds of events are probably the better thing to tie your mortgage to [than interest rate predictions],\u201d says Jon Bone, the head of mortgages at the online mortgage broker Better.co.uk. Weigh up upfront costs Many lenders will offer the choice between a mortgage that comes with an arrangement fee and a lower rate of interest, or is fee-free with a higher rate. You may be swayed by the need for lower monthly costs, or by a desire to keep down upfront expenses. NatWest, for example, has a five-year fix at 4.08% with a \u201cproduct fee\u201d of \u00a3995. It also has a fee-free five-year fix, at 4.23%. If not, it may not be immediately obvious which is the cheaper option overall. \u201cYou need to look at the total cost of the deal over the scheme period,\u201d Hollingworth says. Use online calculators to work out how much you will pay over the time that you are locked in for. \u201cIf you have a smaller mortgage, then a big fee will represent a bigger proportion of the cost, and therefore it is likely to be better to look at a lower, or no, fee option despite the higher interest rate,\u201d he says. \u201cConversely a lower rate on a big mortgage may reduce payments enough to warrant the bigger fee.\u201d Don\u2019t overpay to overpay If you want to be able to overpay your mortgage, make sure you choose one without early repayment charges for doing so. Most (but not all) lenders allow you to overpay up to a maximum 10% each year without incurring fees. Always check the terms to avoid additional charges. \u201cThe 10% overpayment allowance is an annual feature, but its start date can vary,\u201d Mendes says. Some lenders calculate it based on the calendar year, others from 1 April, and some from the mortgage anniversary date. Understanding what constitutes the 10% allowance is also crucial. \u201cIt could be based on the original mortgage balance, the balance at the time of overpayment, or the balance at the start of the year,\u201d he says. Choose a reliable broker You can research online through comparison sites and calculators to narrow down your mortgage choices, but with thousands of products out there, unless you\u2019re simply transferring to another deal with your existing lender, it will probably make sense to use a broker. If you are buying a property, the seller\u2019s estate agent might encourage you to use its in-house broker \u2013 it is illegal for them to insist you do. Estate agent brokers often work with a limited panel of mortgage lenders \u2013 ask them to provide you with details of which ones before you decide. A whole-of-market broker will have access to the widest range of mortgages, so that they can select the best deal for your needs from across the board. Always check how they are paid, and what costs you will incur. Brokers receive a commission from lenders when a client signs up for a mortgage, but the amount you pay as a customer varies. Some brokers charge a fixed rate, some charge a percentage fee, while some don\u2019t charge the client at all. Get an agreement in principle It can be useful to get an agreement (or decision) in principle from a lender if you\u2019re househunting, to show estate agents and sellers that you are a serious buyer. This means providing information to a lender work out the amount they are prepared lend you, but it stops short of an official application. \u201cThey aren\u2019t a cast iron guarantee of lending, but they are a good indicator,\u201d says Hollingworth. And they are not binding \u2013 so once you are ready to apply, always review your options to see if there are better deals available first."

            "date": "2024-08-20T13:35:34Z",
            "content": "Gold prices have hit a fresh high as increasing hopes of US interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve prompted investors to buy more of the precious metal. The spot price of gold rose to a record $2,531.60 (\u00a31,943.83) an ounce on Tuesday afternoon, up over 1% on the day. Gold bars generally weigh 400 troy ounces (12.4kg), so a standard gold bar is now worth more than $1m. Analysts have ascribed much of the rally to the prospect of interest rate cuts by central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve. Lower interest rates tend to diminish the lure of bonds and shares because it diminishes the likely returns. That has prompted many investors to place their bets on gold increases. Gold\u2019s practical uses are limited mainly to jewellery and some electronics, and it does not offer anything in the way of returns except the possibility of future price rises. However, it is viewed by investors as a safe haven during turbulent economic and geopolitical times. A reaction to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza appears to have been a factor behind the increase in its value over the past two years, even as US interest rates rose from historic lows to the highest in 23 years. Gold prices have risen by two-thirds since the end of 2019. However, much of that gain has come since the start of March this year. Prices are up by more than a fifth since then, helped by the increasing expectation of rate cuts. Antonio Ernesto Di Giacomo, a senior market analyst at XS, a trading platform, said that the recent surge in gold prices reflected a \u201crise in uncertainty and investors\u2019 flight to safe havens\u201d as well as the prospect of interest rate cuts from the Fed. \u201cThe historic rise in the price of gold above $2,500 per ounce reflects growing global economic uncertainty and investors\u2019 continued search for safety,\u201d he said. \u201cWith economic, geopolitical, and monetary factors driving this surge, gold is solidifying its position as a safe haven in times of volatility.\u201d The investment bank UBS has said that prices could reach $2,600 an ounce by the end of 2024. Markets expect the Fed to cut its target rate for interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to between 5% and 5.25%. Investors will be listening closely to a speech by the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, on Friday at the Jackson Hole resort in Wyoming for signs that rate-setters are content to cut at their next meeting on 18 September. Other big central banks have already started reducing interest rates, with the European Central Bank cutting in June and the Bank of England following suit at the start of this month. Threadneedle Street\u2019s reduction in the base rate to 5% is already translating into cheaper home loan deals for some mortgage borrowers, with seven of the UK\u2019s 10 biggest lenders now advertising fixed-rate offers under 4%."

            "date": "2024-08-27T12:43:26Z",
            "content": "The Colombian Nobel laureate Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, who spent some of his happiest years chronicling life in Caracas, once declared journalism \u201cthe best job in the world\u201d. Not so if you are reporting on today\u2019s Venezuela, where journalists are feeling the heat as the South American country lurches towards full-blown dictatorship under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. In the four weeks since Venezuela\u2019s disputed election, local journalists have come up with a distinctly 21st-century tactic to avoid being arrested for reporting on 21st-century socialism: using artificial intelligence avatars to report all the news Maduro\u2019s regime deems unfit to print. In daily broadcasts, the AI-created newsreaders have been telling the world about the president\u2019s post-election crackdown on opponents, activists and the media, without putting the reporters behind the stories at risk. Carlos Eduardo Huertas, the director of Connectas, the Colombia-based journalism platform coordinating the initiative, said far from being a gimmick, the use of AI was a response to \u201cthe persecution and the growing repression that our colleagues are suffering in Venezuela, where the uncertainty over the safety of doing their job \u2026 grows by the minute\u201d. Huertas said the increasingly authoritarian climate under Maduro meant that \u201cbeing on camera is no longer so sensible\u201d. The solution was to create virtual journalists to conceal the identities of the real reporters who were making the news. The initiative involves about 20 Venezuelan news and factchecking outlets and about 100 journalists who share content, which is turned into daily newscasts presented by avatars called La Chama and El Pana, which roughly translate as Bestie and Buddy. In the debut broadcast this month, the female presenter, Bestie, explained how they hoped to spread the word \u201cabout what is really happening in Venezuela\u201d. \u201cBut before we go on \u2013 in case you haven\u2019t noticed \u2013 we want to let you know that we aren\u2019t real,\u201d the avatar added, before announcing the latest, all-too-real statistics about Maduro\u2019s crusade to stamp out dissent. \u201cIn less than two weeks more than 1,000 people have been detained and at least 23 killed during protests,\u201d Bestie said. The numberof detained now stands at more than 1,400. The name of the AI journalism project, Operaci\u00f3n Retuit (Operation Retweet), is partly an ironic reference to the name Maduro\u2019s regime has given to his harsh crackdown on opponents: Operaci\u00f3n Tun Tun (Operation Knock Knock). At least nine journalists are among the prisoners, according to the Venezuelan journalist\u2019s union, SNTP. One of them \u2013 the 26-year-old sports reporter and photographer Pa\u00fal Le\u00f3n \u2013 was taken by police while filming peaceful protests and later accused of terrorism, a crime that carries a sentence of up to 30 years. On Sunday, the prominent entertainment journalist Carmela Longo was taken from her home in Caracas by police after being sacked from her pro-government newspaper, \u00daltimas Noticias. The need for virtual-reality newscasters is easy to understand given the political chill that has descended on Venezuela since Maduro was first elected in 2013, and has worsened in recent days. \u201cSources are not talking. Journalists are forced to work anonymously, sometimes in hiding, concealing their identities out of fear of government retaliation. Social media accounts have gone silent \u2026 vital parts of the news ecosystem, like X, have been blocked,\u201d the Venezuela-focused website Caracas Chronicles reported last week. This month the former head of the state-controlled broadcaster VTV, Vladimir Villegas, claimed about 100 of its employees had been sacked after messages considered hostile to the government were found in their WhatsApp chats. The second episode of Operation Retweet tackled a particularly dangerous topic given the severity of the government clampdown: it questioned official attempts to blame the opposition \u2013 which Maduro accuses of trying to launch a fascist coup \u2013 for many of the post-election deaths. Contrary to government claims, Operation Retweet\u2019s collective investigations suggested state security forces were largely responsible for the body count. \u201cAll of the victims were killed with firearms and, according to witnesses, the suspected culprits were police officers, soldiers or paramilitary groups which here in Venezuela are known as colectivos,\u201d the male avatar, Buddy, told viewers. His female co-host said most victims were under-30, while a 15-year-old teenager had also been killed. \u201cThey came from working-class communities and they had ordinary jobs such as barbers, caretakers, students, construction workers, street hawkers, motorcycle taxi drivers and sports coaches,\u201d the avatar added. \u201cIn just a few days \u2026 at least 15 children were orphaned.\u201d Huertas, the Colombian journalist, likened his Venezuelan colleagues to firefighters who were risking their lives for democracy. \u201cIf there\u2019s a fire, you want to see firefighters at the scene. Well, now there\u2019s a fire [in Venezuela] and there are many firefighters present,\u201d he said, celebrating Venezuela\u2019s talented and committed press corps. Despite the dangers, \u201c[they] are there on the frontline, doing the work that society needs them to\u201d, Huertas said."

            "date": "2024-08-25T23:01:14Z",
            "content": "Scientists are to analyse more than a million brain scans using artificial intelligence with the aim of developing a tool to predict a person\u2019s risk of dementia. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Dundee will examine CT and MRI scans of patients from Scotland captured over more than a decade, as part of a global research effort called NEURii. The team will use AI and machine learning to match the image data with linked health records to find patterns that could help doctors better determine a person\u2019s risk of developing dementia. The number of people living with dementia globally is forecast to nearly triple to 153 million by 2050, and researchers warn this presents a rapidly growing threat to health and social care systems. Health and social costs linked to dementia already exceed $1tn (\u00a3780bn) a year, research shows. The scientists aim to create digital tools that radiologists can use when scanning patients to determine their risk of dementia and diagnose the disease and related conditions earlier. The tools could also help speed up the development of more precise treatments for dementia, they said. Prof Emanuele Trucco, an expert in AI and medical imaging at Dundee, said: \u201cThis new data set will be of great use to neurological researchers. \u201cShould we establish a successful proof of concept, we will have a suite of software tools that are smoothly and unobtrusively integrated with routine radiology operations that assist clinical decision-making and flag the risk of dementia as early as possible.\u201d Up to 1.6 million images will be scanned, with the approval of the public benefit and privacy panel for health and social care, part of NHS Scotland. The data will be held in the Scottish National Safe Haven, commissioned by Public Health Scotland to provide a secure platform for the use of NHS electronic data for research. The project co-leader, Prof Will Whiteley from Edinburgh\u2019s Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, said: \u201cBetter use of simple brain scans to predict dementia will lead to better understanding of dementia and potentially earlier diagnosis of its causes, which in turn will make development of new treatments easier. \u201cCurrently treatments for dementia are expensive, scarce and of uncertain value. If we can collect data from a large group of people at high risk, who then give their consent to take part in trials, we can really start to develop new treatments.\u201d"

So far, so normal, until: \u201cBut where the fuck are the sex robots?\u201d The footage is from a 2023 address that Blanchett actually gave \u2013 but the rest has been made up. Her voice was generated by Australian artist Xanthe Dobbie using the text-to-speech platform PlayHT for Dobbie\u2019s 2024 video work Future Sex/Love Sounds \u2013 an imagining of a sex robot-induced feminist utopia, voiced by celebrity clones. Much has been written about the world-changing potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), including Midjourney and Open AI\u2019s GPT-4, which are trained on vast swathes of data to create everything from academic essays, fake news and \u201crevenge porn\u201d to music, images and software code. Proponents praise the technology for speeding up scientific research and eliminating mundane admin, while on the other side, a broad range of workers \u2013 from accountants, lawyers and teachers to graphic designers, actors, writers and musicians \u2013 are facing an existential crisis. As the debate rages on, artists such as Dobbie are turning to those very same tools to explore the possibilities and precarities of the technology itself. \u201cThere\u2019s all of this ethical grey area because the legal systems are not able to catch up with anywhere near the same speed at which we\u2019re proliferating the technology itself,\u201d says Dobbie, whose work draws on celebrity internet culture to interrogate technology and power. \u201cWe see these celebrity replicas happening all the time, but our own data \u2013 us, the small people of the world \u2013 is being harvested at exactly the same rate \u2026 It\u2019s not really the capacity of the technology [that\u2019s bad], it\u2019s the way flawed, dumb, evil people choose to wield it.\u201d Choreographer Alisdair Macindoe is another artist working at the nexus of technology and art. His new work Plagiary, opening this week as part of Melbourne\u2019s Now or Never festival followed by a season at Sydney Opera House, uses custom algorithms to generate new choreography performed by dancers receiving it for the first time each night. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning While the AI-generated instructions are specific, each dancer can interpret them in their own way \u2013 making the resulting performance more of a collaboration between man and machine. \u201cOften the questions [from dancers] early on will be like: \u2018I\u2019ve been told to swivel my left elbow repeatedly, to go to the back corner, imagine I\u2019m a cow that\u2019s just been born. Am I still swivelling my left elbow at that point?\u2019\u201d says Macindoe. \u201cIt quite quickly becomes this really interesting discussion about meaning, interpretation and what is truth.\u201d Not all artists are fans of the technology. In January 2023, Nick Cave posted an eviscerating review of a song generated by ChatGPT that mimicked his own work, calling it \u201cbullshit\u201d and \u201ca grotesque mockery of what it is to be human\u201d. \u201cSongs arise out of suffering,\u201d he said, \u201cby which I mean they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation and, well, as far as I know, algorithms don\u2019t feel.\u201d Painter Sam Leach disagrees with Cave\u2019s idea that \u201ccreative genius\u201d is exclusive to humans, but he encounters this kind of \u201cblanket rejection of the technology and anything to do with\u201d often. \u201cI\u2019ve never really been particularly interested in anything related to the purity of the soul. I really view my practice as a way of researching and understanding the world that\u2019s around me \u2026 I just don\u2019t see that we can construct a boundary between ourselves and the rest of the world that allows us to define \u2018me as a unique individual\u2019.\u201d Leach sees AI as a valuable artistic tool, enabling him to grapple with and interpret a vast gamut of creative output. He has customised an array of open source models that he has trained on his own paintings, as well as reference photographs and historical artwork, to produce dozens of compositions, a select few of which he turns into surreal oil paintings \u2013 such as his portrait of a polar bear standing over a bunch of chrome bananas. He justifies his use of sources by highlighting the hours of \u201cediting\u201d he does with his paint brush, to refine his software\u2019s suggestions. He even has art critic chatbots to interrogate his ideas. For Leach, the biggest concern around AI is not the technology itself or how it\u2019s used \u2013 but who owns it: \u201cWe\u2019ve got this very, very small handful of mega companies that own the biggest models, that have incredible power.\u201d One of the most common concerns around AI involves copyright \u2013 a particularly complicated issue for those working in the arts, whose intellectual property is used to train multimillion-dollar models, often without consent or compensation. Last year, for example, it was revealed that 18,000 Australian titles had been used by the Book3 dataset without permission or remuneration in what Booker prize-winning novelist Richard Flanagan described as \u201cthe biggest act of copyright theft in history\u201d. And last week Australian music rights management organisation Apra Amcos released survey results that found 82% of its members were concerned AI could reduce their capacity to make a living through music. In the European Union, the Artificial Intelligence Act came into force on 1 August to mitigate these sorts of risks. In Australia, however, while eight voluntary AI ethics principles have existed since 2019, there are still no specific laws or statutes regulating AI technologies. This legislatorial void is pushing some artists to create their own custom frameworks \u2013 and models \u2013 in order to protect their work and culture. Sound artist Rowan Savage, a Kombumerri man who performs as salllvage, co-developed the AI model Koup Music with the musician Alexis Weaver, as a tool to transform his voice into digital representations of the field recordings he makes on Country, a process he will be presenting at Now or Never festival. Savage\u2019s abstract dance music sounds like dense flocks of electronic birdlife \u2013 animal-code hybrid life forms that are haunting and foreign, yet simultaneously familiar. \u201cSometimes when people think of Aboriginal people in Australia, they think of us as associated with the natural world \u2026 there\u2019s something kind of infantilising about that, that we can use technology to speak back to,\u201d says Savage. \u201cWe often think there\u2019s this rigid divide between what we call natural and what we call technological. I don\u2019t believe in that. I want to break it down and allow the natural world to infect the technological world.\u201d Savage designed Koup Music to give him full control over which data it is trained on, to avoid appropriating the work of other artists without their consent. In turn, the model protects Savage\u2019s recordings from being fed into the larger networks Koup is built on \u2013 recordings he considers the property of his community. \u201cI think it\u2019s fine for me personally to use the recordings that I make of my Country, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily put them out into the world [for any person or thing to use],\u201d says Savage. \u201c[I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable] without talking to important people in my community. As Aboriginal people, we\u2019re always community minded, there\u2019s not individual ownership of sources in the same way that the Anglo world might think about it.\u201d For Savage, AI offers great creative potential \u2013 but also \u201cquite a lot of dangers\u201d. \u201cMy concern as an artist is: how do we use AI in ways that are ethical but also really allow us to do different and exciting things?\u201d Now or Never Melbourne runs until 31 August. An earlier work by Xanthe Dobbie, The Long Now (2022) is available to view at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image website. Alisdair Macoindoe\u2019s Plagiary runs from until 30 August at Now or Never in Melbourne and 12 to 14 September at Unwrapped Sydney. Sam Leach is now creating new work in conjunction with the National Museum of Australia."

            "content": "US intelligence officials have confirmed that Iran was behind a hack of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, authorities said on Monday. In a joint statement, the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said it attributed \u201crecently reported activities to compromise former President Trump\u2019s campaign\u201d to Iran, and that the intelligence community is \u201cconfident that the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaigns of both political parties\u201d. Iran\u2019s efforts include \u201cthefts and disclosures\u201d and \u201care intended to influence the US election process\u201d, the statement said. The announcement comes a week after several news organizations, including the New York Times, the Washington Post and Politico, reported that they had received internal campaign records, including a dossier on Ohio senator JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate. The former president had blamed the Iranian government in the immediate aftermath, saying Microsoft informed the campaign about the hack. Trump also asserted that \u201conly publicly available information\u201d was taken. Last week, Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign said the FBI had warned that it had been targeted by foreign hackers. Officials with the vice-president\u2019s campaign said its cybersecurity measures had successfully thwarted the hacking attempt. The hacking efforts were part of a broader campaign to impact the US election, the intelligence officials\u2019 statement said: \u201cIran perceives this year\u2019s elections to be particularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests, increasing Tehran\u2019s inclination to try to shape the outcome. We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting presidential campaigns.\u201d The FBI has been in contact with victims of the hacking and \u201cwill continue to investigate and gather information in order to pursue and disrupt the threat actors responsible\u201d, the statement said, adding: \u201cWe will not tolerate foreign efforts to influence or interfere with our elections, including the targeting of American political campaigns.\u201d In 2016, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign was hacked, leading to the release of internal emails, which became a major controversy in the presidential campaign.

There was this one image of a man lying on an operating table, covered in bags of McCain\u2019s frozen french fries and hash browns. Scientists had discovered rapid cooling of the body might improve the survival rates of patients who had experienced heart attacks. This man was one such patient, thus the Frozen Food Fresco.

AI, after all, can\u2019t visit Alfred hospital and \u2013 at least right now \u2013 it\u2019s not conducting any interviews. But AI-generated articles are already being written and their latest appearance in the media signals a worrying development. Last week, it was revealed staff and contributors to Cosmos claim they weren\u2019t consulted about the rollout of explainer articles billed as having been written by generative artificial intelligence. The articles cover topics like \u201cwhat is a black hole?\u201d and \u201cwhat are carbon sinks?\u201d At least one of them contained inaccuracies. The explainers were created by OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and then fact-checked against Cosmos\u2019s 15,000-article strong archive. Full details of the publication\u2019s use of AI were published by the ABC on August 8. In that article, CSIRO Publishing, an independent arm of CSIRO and the current publisher of Cosmos, stated the AI-generated articles were an \u201cexperimental project\u201d to assess the \u201cpossible usefulness (and risks)\u201d of using a model like GPT-4 to \u201cassist our science communication professionals to produce draft science explainer articles\u201d. Two former editors said that editorial staff at Cosmos were not told about the proposed custom AI service. It comes just four months after Cosmos made five of its eight staff redundant. The ABC also wrote that Cosmos contributors were not aware of its intention to roll out the AI model, nor did it notify them that their work would be used as part of the fact-checking process. CSIRO Publishing dismissed concerns that the AI service was trained on contributors\u2019 articles, with a spokesperson noting the experiment used a pre-trained GPT-4 model from OpenAI. But the lack of internal transparency and consultation has left journalists and contributors feeling betrayed and angry. Multiple sources suggest the experiment has now been put on pause, but CSIRO Publishing did not respond to a request for comment. The controversy has provided a dizzying sense of deja vu. We\u2019ve seen this before. Well-respected US tech website CNET, where I served as science editor until August 2023, published dozens of articles generated by a custom AI engine at the end of 2022. In total, CNET\u2019s robot writer racked up 77 bylines and, after investigation by rival publications, more than half of its articles were found to contain inaccuracies. The backlash was swift and damning. One report said the internet was \u201chorrified\u201d by CNET\u2019s use of AI. The Washington Post dubbed the experiment \u201ca journalistic disaster\u201d. Trust in the publication was shattered, basically overnight, and, for journalists in the organisation, there was a feeling of betrayal and anger. The Cosmos example provides a startling parallel. The backlash has been swift, once again, with journalists weighing in. \u201cComprehensively appalling,\u201d wrote Natasha Mitchell, host of the ABC\u2019s Big Ideas. And even the responses by the organisations are almost identical: dub it an experiment, pause the rollout. This time, however, the AI is being used to present facts underpinned by scientific research. This is a worrying development with potentially catastrophic consequences. At a time when trust in scientific expertise and the media are both declining (the latter more precipitously than the former), rolling out an AI experiment with a lack of transparency is, at best, ignorant, and, at worst, dangerous. Science can reduce uncertainty but not erase it. Effective science journalism involves helping the audience understand that uncertainty and, research shows, improves trust in the scientific process. Generative AI, unfortunately, remains a predictive text tool that can undermine this process, producing confident-sounding bullshit. That\u2019s not to say generative AI doesn\u2019t have a place in newsrooms and should be banned. It\u2019s already being used as an idea generator, for quick feedback on drafts or help with headlines. And, with appropriate oversight, perhaps it will become important for smaller publishers, like Cosmos, to maintain a steady stream of content in an internet age ravenous for more. Even so, if AI is going to be deployed in this way, there are outstanding issues that haven\u2019t been resolved. The confident-sounding false information is just the beginning. Issues around copyright and the theft of art to train these models has made its way to court, and there are serious sustainability issues to contend with: AI\u2019s energy and water usage, though hard to definitively calculate, are immense. The bigger barrier though is the audience: The University of Canberra\u2019s Digital News Report 2024 suggests only 17% of Australians are comfortable with news produced \u201cmostly by AI\u201d. It also noted that only 25% of respondents were comfortable with AI being used specifically for science and technology reporting. If the audience doesn\u2019t want to read AI-generated content, who is it being made for? The Cosmos controversy brings that question into stark relief. This is the first question that needs to be answered when rolling out AI and it\u2019s a question that should be answered transparently. Both editorial staff and readers should be privy to the reason why an outlet might start using generative AI and where it will do so. There can be no secrecy or subterfuge \u2013 that, we\u2019ve seen time and again, is how you destroy trust. But, if you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ve reached the end of this article and want to know more about the heart attack guy who was saved by a bunch of McCain\u2019s frozen food. And there\u2019s a lesson in that: the best stories stick with you. From what we\u2019ve seen to date, AI-generated articles don\u2019t have that staying power.

            "content": "Your editorial on nature-friendly farming (12 August) rightly points out that a reduction in meat and dairy consumption is the most effective way to provide food security while protecting nature and biodiversity, and curbing emissions. There\u2019s ample evidence that more food can be produced on less land if crops feed people directly, rather than farmed animals. What\u2019s missing so far is the necessary leadership to effect change. The Conservative government failed to take up the national food strategy recommendation of a 30% reduction in meat and dairy production by 2030 or to follow the Climate Change Committee\u2019s advice to reduce meat consumption by 35% by 2050. Well done to those councils, most recently Calderdale in West Yorkshire, that have passed motions to lead the way on this. A shift is needed away from regarding meat dishes as the norm. If restaurants and cafes offer food choices that are 50% plant-based, this could easily nudge behaviour towards more sustainable eating. The emissions and environmental impact of food must be part of climate policy everywhere. Linda Newbery Barford St Michael, Oxfordshire \u2022 It is good to hear confirmation in the recent Natural England report of what many farmers had already observed: that the public funding of farm wildlife schemes is increasing numbers of butterflies, bats, bees and birds (Wildlife boosted by England\u2019s nature-friendly farming schemes, study finds, 9 August). There are, however, serious threats to the continued success of these schemes, which have been introduced over the last 25 years. First, the payments now being offered under the post-Brexit schemes are effectively lower than over the previous 20 years and are unlikely to allow farmers to continue to provide this public benefit. Second, it is estimated in the report that farm food production will fall by 25% as a result of the change of land use from food to wildlife habitat. And third, the increasing regulation, which reduces the ability to control overpopulations of some very successful predators.

            "content": "The EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said its members have given up hope of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro producing evidence that he won Venezuela\u2019s election and will not accept his legitimacy as president-elect. Addressing reporters after EU foreign ministers held a video call with Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, the former diplomat widely believed to have beaten Maduro in the 28 July vote, Borrell announced: \u201cThe European Council decided that Maduro has no democratic legitimacy as president.\u201d Maduro has refused to publish detailed election voting tallies supporting his claim to victory \u2013 something that has nearly always been done since Venezuela\u2019s electronic voting system was introduced by his mentor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, in 2004. \u201cAs there are no tallies and there is no verification, and we fear that there will never be any, we cannot accept Maduro\u2019s legitimacy as Venezuela\u2019s president-elect,\u201d Borrell told journalists after an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. \u201cHe will remain president de facto,\u201d Borrell said, \u201cbut we deny democratic legitimacy based on the results that cannot be verified.\u201d The EU\u2019s stance stopped short of recognising Gonz\u00e1lez as president-elect or the official winner of the election. But Borrell said he believed voting data published by Venezuela\u2019s opposition showed the opposition candidate \u201cgot strong support \u2026 much bigger support than the one got by Maduro\u201d. Tensions continued to rise in Venezuela on Thursday, with Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s main backer, the opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, claiming she feared Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s home would be raided by security forces in the coming hours. A prominent opposition politician, Biagio Pilieri, and his son were reportedly seized by secret police after leaving an opposition rally on Wednesday afternoon. The previous day one of Machado\u2019s closest confidants, the lawyer and opposition spokesperson Perkins Rocha, was also allegedly taken. \u201cDad, I love you and I hope we see each other again soon \u2026 in a free Venezuela,\u201d Rocha\u2019s son, Santiago, said in a video message to his father, whose whereabouts remains unknown. Pilieri and Rocha are among more than 1,600 people who human rights activists say have been arrested as part of a post-election crackdown designed to extinguish the latest in a series of opposition challenges to Maduro\u2019s 11-year rule. Borrell said the EU called on Maduro\u2019s government to \u201cput an end to the repression and respect the dignity, freedom and rights of the opposition, starting with Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, all opposition members, civil society and journalists\u201d. \u201cPolitical prisoners have to be freed,\u201d he added. However, many expect the repression to intensify after Maduro made one of his political movement\u2019s most hard-line figures, Diosdado Cabello, interior minister this week. That position gives the 61-year-old former soldier control of the Bolivarian national police force and the national intelligence service, Sebin."

            "content": "Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential campaign has confirmed it was warned by the FBI it had been targeted by a foreign influence campaign, triggering renewed fears over foreign interference in US elections. The disclosure \u2013 reported by NBC \u2013 came after Donald Trump\u2019s campaign claimed it had been hacked in an email phishing attempt, suspected to have been carried out by Iran. The FBI has confirmed in a statement it is investigating foreign hacking attempts against the campaigns. Harris\u2019s campaign insisted on Tuesday its cybersecurity measures had prevented its systems from being hacked. \u201cWe have robust cybersecurity measures in place, and are not aware of any security breaches of our systems resulting from those efforts,\u201d the campaign told NBC. But the confirmation of the FBI\u2019s warning evoked memories of the 2016 campaign, when Russia was widely believed to have hacked the Democratic party\u2019s email system in an effort to destabilise Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid and help Trump. The Russian hacking effort involved files being given to WikiLeaks, which subsequently published them. This time, the bureau said it was investigating efforts to hack the Biden-Harris campaign in the period before Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race \u2013 effectively handing the Democratic nomination to Harris, the vice-president \u2013 as well as that of Trump, according to the Washington Post. Three Biden-Harris campaign staff members received spear phishing emails designed to look legitimate in order to give an intruder access to wider email communications, the Post reported. It is unclear whether the phishing attempt was successful, and the response by the now-renamed Harris campaign suggested that the vice-president\u2019s staff were confident the campaign had not been hacked. By contrast, the Washington Post and two other US news outlets \u2013 Politico and the New York Times \u2013 reported last weekend receiving apparently authentic files stolen from the Trump campaign. A spokesperson for the campaign said on Saturday it had been hacked in June. It is unclear whether the stolen campaign files were a result of the apparently successful hacking attempt. The Trump campaign is understood not to have reported the hack to the FBI, due to its suspicion of the agency. The phishing attempt is understood to have also targeted Roger Stone, a long-time Trump ally who is now formally linked to his current presidential campaign. \u201cI was informed by the authorities that a couple of my personal email accounts have been compromised,\u201d Stone told the Washington Post. \u201cI really don\u2019t know more about it. And I\u2019m cooperating. It\u2019s all very strange.\u201d US intelligence officials said last month that Iran was attempting to sow discord and undermine Trump\u2019s attempts to recapture the White House. Iran has denied the accusations. The renewed suspicions come amid speculation that the country\u2019s Islamic regime is preparing a strike against Israel in retaliation for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader, in Tehran last week."

            "title": "Sixfold rise in foreign care workers in UK complaining of exploitation",
            "date": "2024-08-19T19:00:23Z",
            "content": "The number of foreign social care workers reporting that they are trapped in exploitative contracts has risen sixfold in the last three years, in the latest evidence of widespread abuse of migrants in the British care system. Data from the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) shows that the organisation was contacted 134 times in 2023-24 by care workers reporting that their employers were demanding large sums of money from them to cover \u201chiring costs\u201d, including visa processing, if they left their jobs. This figure was up from 22 such complaints just three years ago. The rise in complaints about repayment clauses, which in one case ran to \u00a310,000, underlines how a recent explosion in recruitment of carers from abroad has allowed unscrupulous employers to target vulnerable workers. Nicola Ranger, the RCN general secretary, said: \u201cRogue employers appear to be forcing migrants to pay thousands of pounds just to leave jobs and threatening them with deportation. Those who come to the UK to care for the vulnerable deserve so much better than this exploitation. \u201cSadly, we know the surge in exploitation cases being reported to the RCN is only the tip of the iceberg. Migrant workers are routinely intimidated and left fearful of speaking out, even having their passports withheld. They are also much less likely to be members of trade unions.\u201d A combination of the pandemic and post-Brexit immigration controls prompted a massive staffing crisis in Britain\u2019s social care sector, which ministers in the previous government tackled by making it much easier to hire care workers from abroad. Between 2020-21 and 2023-24 the number of staff recruited internationally into adult social care rose from 10,000 to 94,000, according to data from Skills for Care. However, the new system, which allowed care providers to bring in workers quickly as long as they met certain salary thresholds, has led to widespread accusations of mistreatment. The Guardian revealed earlier this year that dozens of migrant workers employed by 11 different British agencies had accused their employers of exploitation. All of these workers had paid \u201cvisa processing costs\u201d of as high as \u00a320,000, often to middlemen in India, for guaranteed work in the UK that did not materialise. In the wake of those revelations, Yvette Cooper, then the shadow home secretary, promised that Labour would launch an investigation into the issue if it won the election. Some workers are seeking redress through the legal system. A British employment judge recently ruled that one worker who had not been given his contracted hours could be eligible for compensation worth more than \u00a310,000. The RCN has been tracking cases of workers who try to leave their jobs only to be told by their employers that they owe thousands of pounds in repayments, often for what the employer calls \u201chiring costs\u201d. The organisation has seen a rise in such cases over the past few years, receiving 17 calls from its members in May alone. In one case, a worker reported that they had been suffering from severe bullying and harassment. When they tried to leave their role, they were told they would have to pay \u00a310,000 \u2013 despite no such figure being listed in their contract. Another care worker told the RCN that they had been assaulted and racially abused at work, prompting them to quit their job. After doing so, they were told they owed more than \u00a33,000 for visa costs. A third had their employment immediately terminated after they reported to their employer that they had tested positive for Covid, and they were then hit with a large repayment fee despite having no job or income. Lawyers have said some of the practices in the British care industry show signs of trafficking and modern slavery, where punitive repayment clauses are common. The Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority reported that it received 123 reports of modern slavery and human trafficking in the care sector in 2023 and that the sector accounted for more than half of all reports of forced labour. The RCN is now repeating its call for a government investigation into labour practices in the area. Ranger said: \u201cThe exploitation being allowed to spread is deeply inhumane and undermines the entire social care sector. Ministers were right to commit to an investigation during the election campaign and this must now happen with urgency. Lives are being destroyed every day and this cannot wait. We need action to protect our migrant care workers and raise standards in the sector.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cThere has been an unacceptable rise in the recorded abuse and exploitation of care workers in the adult social care sector. \u201cThe sponsorship system, which holds providers to highest standards, has highlighted these unethical practices, and urgent work is taking place across the sector to address this.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-23T11:42:48Z",
            "content": "The head of Israel\u2019s security agency, Shin Bet, has warned the country\u2019s leaders that Jewish terrorism in the West Bank is out of control and has become a serious threat to national security. Ronen Bar issued the warning in a letter to the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the attorney general and members of the Israeli cabinet, some of whom are outspoken backers of the extremist settlers responsible for the escalating violence. Bar\u2019s letter, sent last week but published by Israel\u2019s Channel 12 News on Thursday night, has highlighted the wide, acrimonious gap between the far-right wing of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition and Israel\u2019s security apparatus. The national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, one of those criticised by Bar for inflammatory behaviour, called for the Shin Bet head to be fired, triggering a rebuke on Friday from the defence minister, Yoav Gallant. Bar\u2019s letter focused on Jewish extremists known as the \u201chilltop youth\u201d, violent militants who have been conducting a campaign of murder, arson and intimidation against Palestinians on the West Bank, aimed at driving them from their land, furthering the far right\u2019s pursuit of complete annexation. Bar said their actions should not be described as criminality but as terrorism. \u201cIt isn\u2019t crime because it\u2019s the use of violence to create intimidation, to spread fear. That is terror,\u201d he wrote, describing how the campaign had \u201csignificantly expanded\u201d in the absence of an adequate police response and with the connivance of some national leaders. The militants had gone from using \u201ccigarette lighters to the weapons of war\u201d, the security chief said, adding that some of those weapons had been provided by the state. The terror campaign, the letter said, was \u201ca large stain on Judaism and on all of us\u201d. Bar warned the hilltop youth had gone \u201cfrom evading the security forces to attacking the security forces, from cutting themselves off from the establishment to receiving legitimacy from certain officials in the establishment\u201d. The Shin Bet director also referred to the \u201cspectacle\u201d of Ben-Gvir\u2019s visit last month to the compound of al-Aqsa mosque and Dome of the Rock, Islam\u2019s holiest site in Jerusalem. The esplanade is also holy to Jews who know it as the Temple Mount, but the status quo for decades has been that while Jews could visit, only Muslims could pray there. During his 18 July visit, Ben-Gvir led prayers in front of the cameras and vowed to change the status quo permanently. Such actions, Bar warned, could lead \u201cto profuse bloodshed and change the face of the state out of all recognition\u201d. The security chief, who has been in the post since 2021, said he had reluctantly decided to send the letter \u201cwith pain and great fear, as a Jew, as an Israeli and as a security official, about the escalating phenomenon of Jewish terrorism from the \u2018hilltop youth\u2019\u201d, which he felt was approaching a tipping point. \u201cWe\u2019re on the threshold of a significant, reality-changing process,\u201d Bar wrote. \u201cThe damage to Israel, especially at this time, and to the majority of the settlers is indescribable: a loss of global legitimacy even among our best friends, deploying IDF forces at a time the army, which isn\u2019t meant to deal with these missions, is finding it difficult to carry out all its tasks.\u201d The nationalist leadership, Bar concluded, was \u201cwilling to jeopardise the state\u2019s security and its very existence\u201d in the name of their ideology. N12 reported that Ben-Gvir had walked out of a meeting of Israel\u2019s security cabinet after Bar\u2019s letter arrived, and called for his dismissal. Netanyahu has not so far tried to oust Bar but has been critical of the Shin Bet chief and David Barnea, the director of the external spy agency, the Mossad, for their role as negotiators in Gaza peace talks, implying they were willing to sacrifice Israel\u2019s security to reach a deal to release hostages being held by Hamas. \u201cI am facing the security establishment and the negotiating leaders alone,\u201d Netanyahu said, in remarks quoted by N12. \u201cThey display weakness and are only trying to find ways to concede, whereas I insist on the state of Israel\u2019s interests and am not willing to capitulate to demands that will undermine security.\u201d In the spat between Bar and Ben-Gvir however, Netanyahu\u2019s defence minister sided with the security chief. \u201cIn the face of Minister Ben-Gvir\u2019s irresponsible actions that endanger the national security of the state of Israel and create an internal division in the nation, [the Shin Bet chief] and his people are doing their duty and warning against the serious consequences of these actions,\u201d Gallant said on the X social media platform. Ben-Gvir hit back on X, telling Gallant to stop attacking him and \u201cto start attacking Hezbollah\u201d, egging on the defence chief to start a preemptive war in Lebanon, a longstanding demand of the Israeli right."

            "date": "2024-08-20T17:57:13Z",
            "content": "Private equity sometimes gets \u201ca bad rap\u201d and generally makes its returns by growing businesses rather than via \u201cfinancial engineering\u201d, opined Andrew Higginson, then chair of the supermarket chain Morrisons, when his board agreed to sell to the buyout firm Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice for \u00a37bn in 2021. Really? Three years on, there is no sign of growth \u2013 in the sense of gains in market share \u2013 at either Morrisons or Asda, the other big buyout deal of 2021 (by TDR Capital and the Issa brothers, Mohsin and Zuber). In September 2021 Morrisons represented 9.8% of the UK grocery market, on the research group Kantar\u2019s numbers; last month it had 8.6%. And the recent market share decline at Asda has been so acute that its chair, Lord Rose, a retail veteran, said he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d. Asda\u2019s share has fallen from 14.3% to 12.6% since 2021, which, in an industry where shifts usually happen in fractions of percentage points over years, is a plunge. Sainsbury\u2019s, which for years was neck-and-neck with Asda in the race to be second to Tesco, is now furlongs ahead at 15.3%. The conclusion from those statistics is the obvious one: servicing vast quantities of debt damages your competitive edge, especially when you\u2019re up against the muscle of conservatively capitalised Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco. The degree of leverage put on the two buyout companies is best illustrated by the debt ratings awarded by the agency Moody\u2019s. Morrisons, even after selling its petrol forecourts for \u00a32.5bn and cutting debt by 35%, is still five notches away from investment grade. Asda is four away. That is not to say either chain has been starved of capital. Asda has expanded into convenience stores and is spending \u00a3800m on an IT project to detach itself from the systems of its former owner, Walmart\u2019s. Morrisons still had enough cash to buy the McColls convenience chain. Rather, the drag on performance shows in more subtle ways. Morrisons was outgunned on prices at the height of the cost of living crisis and Asda seems to have fallen short on retailing basics such as product availability and controlling checkout queues. Yet all those failings, one can argue, stem from the relentless demand to hit annual cashflow targets to keep the buyout arithmetic on track. Do not, though, assume the private equity barons will lose their shirts. Despite the trading struggles, there is probably still enough wriggle room in the numbers. Morrisons\u2019 market share has stabilised in the past year under its new chief executive, Rami Baiti\u00e9h; free cash could turn positive this financial year, thinks Moody\u2019s. Asda\u2019s position is weaker on the ground but the background noise created by Zuber Issa selling his stake to TDR Capital has now passed; and Rose should soon be able to hire a proper retail chief executive, as opposed to having Mohsin try to do the job himself. But, if the financial bets come good in, say, five years\u2019 time, it probably won\u2019t be because Morrisons and Asda have suddenly learned to land competitive blows on Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s. It will be because the financial engineering \u2013 the replacement of equity with debt \u2013 was merely aggressive, as opposed to catastrophic. The sliver of equity in the original Asda deal was just \u00a3780m (or \u00a3200m on a ultra-strict definition) in a \u00a36.8bn deal, so there\u2019s obviously upside if borrowings can be sweated down to vaguely manageable levels. But the notion that either buyout deal was seriously aimed at growth, as the rest of the world understands the term, was nonsense. The growth has happened at Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco. The buyouts were old-fashioned games of leverage and debt gymnastics, just as they looked on day one."

            "date": "2024-08-04T23:01:44Z",
            "content": "Pharmacies across England are unable to provide critical NHS and public health services owing to the overwhelming financial and operational pressures they are facing, according to research. A poll of pharmacy owners representing more than 2,100 pharmacies found that more than 96% of respondents said they had stopped providing locally commissioned services over the past 12 months. These include emergency contraception and products to help quit smoking. Four in five (81%) of pharmacy owners polled said they have had to stop offering extended opening hours, while 90% have had to stop employing locum pharmacists owing to the high costs. Of the 92 owners polled for the representative body Community Pharmacy England, more than one-fifth said they have had to end free delivery of prescription medicines to patients. The research comes as data shows that almost 1,000 pharmacies in England have closed since 2017, with poorer areas being affected disproportionately by the closures. The Pharmacy First scheme was fully launched on 1 January this year, with patients in England now offered treatment for seven common conditions including urinary tract infections and shingles by a chemist without having to see a GP. Janet Morrison, chief executive of Community Pharmacy England, said: \u201cAcross England patients and local communities are paying the price of our collapsing community pharmacy network, as thousands of pharmacies have been left with no choice but to reduce the services that they can offer. These are not decisions that any pharmacy wants to make, but with a 30% real-terms funding reduction and spiralling costs, pharmacy owners are having to make impossible decisions to try to keep their doors open. Nick Kaye, the chair of the National Pharmacy Association, said: \u201cThe nation\u2019s community pharmacies are under enormous pressure and are totally underfunded for their vital work on the health service frontline. \u201cThis has inevitably resulted in cutbacks such as reduced opening hours and ending free medicines deliveries to housebound patients. Worse still, well over 1,000 pharmacies have been forced to close in the past decade. \u201cThe government should be investing in us to reduce GP waiting times, but right now we are going backwards instead of fulfilling our potential as skilled clinicians. He added: \u201cIf GPs limit the number of daily appointments, more patients will come to community pharmacies for help, but we are not in great shape after years of cuts. Our ability to be an effective shock-absorber for disruption elsewhere in the healthcare system has been eroded and we have serious capacity challenges. \u201cWe need a new deal for community pharmacies that properly funds our work and allows us to deliver great NHS services. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThe NHS is broken, and pharmacies have been undervalued for too long. \u201cThis government will shift the focus of the NHS out of hospitals and into the community. We will expand the role of pharmacies making better use of pharmacists\u2019 skills, including accelerating the rollout of independent prescribing and establishing a community pharmacist prescribing service.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-01T15:00:05Z",
            "content": "Australian universities\u2019 dependence on international student fees has \u201cfuelled a culture of revenue, profit and competition\u201d and created an unstable business model, the head of the National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) has warned. Critics representing various interests in the sector joined in expressing anxiety at the position universities had found themselves in as the federal government aggressively tries to wind back the number of international students. The chief executive of Universities Australia, Luke Sheehy, said tertiary institutions had \u201ccome to rely on international student revenue to fund everything we do in the face of declining government support in recent years \u2013 from teaching and research to infrastructure projects and employing people in well-paid jobs\u201d. In percentage terms, Australia has more international students than any OECD country bar Luxembourg \u2013 and well in excess of the UK, Canada and the United States. The Group of Eight (Go8) institutions are particularly reliant on international student fees, with foreign enrolments making up 47% of the total cohort at the University of Sydney and more than 35% at the University of Melbourne, the Australian National University, the University of Queensland and the University of Adelaide. Universities earn nearly twice as much from overseas students as from domestic students. Average revenue per domestic full-time equivalent student was $22,996 in 2023, compared with $41,117 for an overseas equivalent student. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The president of the NTEU, Alison Barnes, said a growing dependence on foreign income had fuelled \u201ccorporatisation\u201d of the sector. \u201c[International students] add a lot to our campuses, they\u2019re an asset \u2013 but they\u2019re seen as cash cows,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a systemic risk associated with relying on international student fees that was demonstrated during Covid \u2013 it\u2019s not stable. But it\u2019s inherently problematic beyond the associated risks. \u201cThe aggressive pursuit of international student income has fuelled a culture of revenue, profit and competition for students.\u201d When the federal government released its strategy to fix Australia\u2019s \u201cbroken\u201d migration system late last year, international students were squarely on the agenda. The education minister, Jason Clare, said the government was sending a \u201cclear message\u201d it would act to \u201cprotect Australia\u2019s reputation as a high-quality international education provider\u201d, announcing tougher minimum English-language requirements and targeted visa scrutiny of \u201chigh-risk\u201d providers. Since then, a series of levers have been pulled aiming to reduce the flow of international students into Australia, which reached record highs in February. First, the commonwealth proposed a cap on international students, giving the education minister unprecedented powers to limit enrolments by institution and course. Then it more than doubled the international student visa application fee from $710 to $1,600, a move described by the International Education Association of Australia as \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d. Sheehy described the government\u2019s approach to international students as \u201cpolicy chaos\u201d that could cost thousands of jobs. The sector needed \u201ccertainty, stability and growth\u201d, he told Guardian Australia. \u201cInternational education is a great Australian success story and any changes to the policies that underpin this $48bn sector must be weighed carefully against its significant and far-reaching impact,\u201d he said. \u2018A victim of its own success\u2019 Abul Rizvi, a former deputy secretary at the immigration department, has been lobbying the federal government to implement a minimum university entrance exam score in place of its proposed reforms. He said the score, similar to an Atar, would limit the incentive for institutions to put tuition fee revenue above academic excellence. Rizvi has been a longstanding critic of successive governments\u2019 approach to international education. He told the National Press Club in June that the \u201cunderfunded\u201d sector had \u201clong been chasing tuition revenue from overseas students and sacrificing learning integrity in the process\u201d. But he maintains that an increase in visa fees will simply mean more government revenue \u2013 not better quality students. \u201cWe\u2019re actually shooting ourselves in the foot,\u201d he wrote earlier this year. \u201cThe people it will deter will tend to be good students with options.\u201d Gwilym Croucher, a higher education expert at the University of Melbourne, said Australia had been a \u201cvictim of its own success\u201d in many ways. \u201cInternational student revenue has provided a lot of resources but caused inequality between institutions,\u201d Croucher said, pointing to the University of Sydney, which derives more than 40% of its total revenue from foreign enrolments \u2013 more than the funding it receives from the government. \u201cThat is an extraordinary amount, it\u2019s brought them a huge bounty, but for the government, there\u2019s often no need to make decisions about the allocation of resources \u2026 because there\u2019s been a lot of money flowing into the system that can smooth over the gaps.\u201d Of the $34.7bn in revenue universities received in 2022, $8.5bn came from international students. In 2012, the figure was about $4bn. And while international student revenue has more than doubled, federal government investment has lagged for three decades. Current investment in research and development sits well below the OECD average. Croucher said the drift dated back to the global financial crisis, leading to a gradual unwinding of investment in bodies such as the Australian Research Council (ARC). \u201cIt\u2019s a hard conversation we have to have,\u201d Croucher said. \u201cResearch is a long-term investment, but difficult for politicians to sell.\u201d The deputy chief executive of the Group of Eight, Matthew Brown, said international student revenue was necessary to make up for government underfunding of research and teaching in \u201ckey disciplines\u201d such as engineering, health and science. \u201cAll Go8 members are in the top 100 universities globally and this reflects the support of international student revenue to make up for the underfunding of government,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere this reliance on international student revenue is greatest is in university research \u2013 the backbone of the national research effort \u2013 where Go8 members carry out 70% of Australia\u2019s university research. \u201cThe government is making a critical mistake by using international students as a scapegoat to manage a short-term spike in migration and ease housing pressure.\u201d Students\u2019 debt trap Barnes said there had been a \u201cmassive growth\u201d in marketing and recruitment spending in recent years, but little had been done to ensure international students received adequate levels of support. There is barely any regulatory policy requiring universities to ensure the welfare of their international students. \u201cI\u2019ve taught many international students, they\u2019re a great joy to teach but \u2026 these are kids in a country without family support [or] friends, English isn\u2019t their first language and they\u2019re paying a lot of money for their degrees to not be adequately supported in what they need to achieve,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen students who may have plagiarised, not because of malice but [out of] desperation and lack of support.\u201d Between 2016 and 2019, the Monash Graduate Association assisted with 500 academic integrity cases. Between 2020 and 2024, the number tripled to 1,500. Its president, Sahampath Hettiarachchi, said there was a direct correlation between a student\u2019s financial circumstances and the likelihood that they would engage in academic cheating. He said he had helped international students who told him they were driven to cheat as they could not afford to repeat units because their family had already over-borrowed for them to study in Australia, or because they could not afford to pay rent. \u201cIt\u2019s a last-ditch effort \u2013 they don\u2019t have other options,\u201d he said. \u201cThese students are working largely in isolation, new to the country, with little to no social support. \u201cThere\u2019s a troubling myth international students are wealthy but in reality they\u2019re under heavy rental stress, they\u2019ve had to take out a loan or sell a house just to pursue their studies, not to mention staggering visa costs and airfares.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-09T16:01:10Z",
            "content": "Universities in England face a \u201ctipping point\u201d this autumn engulfing some of them in financial crisis, according to vice-chancellors, who say urgent government intervention may be needed to stop institutions from going under. The warnings come as hundreds of thousands of sixth formers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland await their A-level results next Thursday. Their decisions on where and when to attend higher education will be a make-or-break point for several universities. David Maguire, vice-chancellor of the University of East Anglia, said that \u201can awful lot of institutions are placing extremely large bets on this recruitment round\u201d and warned: \u201cQuite frankly I don\u2019t think there are enough students to go around.\u201d Sector leaders who spoke to the Guardian said that, until improved long-term funding was secured, the most likely short-term solutions included mergers between institutions, and reorganisations such as pruning departments. Maguire said that with international student recruitment falling sharply, universities were having to \u201caggressively\u201d recruit more UK undergraduates in the clearing admissions process. \u201cI think the tipping point will follow clearing \u2013 it\u2019s usually 1 October before the dust has settled and people know how many students they are going to get,\u201d he said. \u201cI think some [governing] councils will be calling in the books, as it were, and assessing the financial viability of their organisations. So I\u2019m very worried about the months of October, November and December.\u201d This year\u2019s clearing could be more fraught for students who get worse than expected results, according to a forecast that the number of top A-level grades awarded will be lower than last year. Prof Alan Smithers, of the University of Buckingham, predicts there will be 16,000 fewer A and A* grades awarded than in 2023. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, has said that universities in England should not expect a government bailout, arguing that they are autonomous institutions that should rely on their own resources. One vice-chancellor \u2013 who declined to be named \u2013 said this year\u2019s admission round was \u201cdoubly dangerous\u201d because declining numbers of domestic and international students were coupled with higher costs, meaning that even compared with a year ago universities were having to spend more while receiving less revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s like Ernest Hemingway said about the two ways of going bankrupt \u2013 gradually, then suddenly. We\u2019ve had the \u2018gradually\u2019 part,\u201d the vice-chancellor said. Another vice-chancellor said that many universities would have to \u201ccut hard and stumble through\u201d the crisis. Already 67 institutions are carrying out redundancy and restructuring programmes, setting off bruising industrial disputes. On Friday the University and College Union announced that Sheffield Hallam University staff were the latest to vote for strikes next month, in protest at what it said were \u201cunprecedented\u201d job cuts. Jo Grady, UCU\u2019s general secretary, has written to ministers asking them to bring forwards plans for support. \u201cAnything short of an emergency rescue package for the sector will be insufficient to stave off catastrophe,\u201d she said. While ministers acknowledge that universities have been starved of funding by the previous government\u2019s decision to keep domestic undergraduate tuition fees at \u00a39,250 a year since 2016 \u2013 and now worth about \u00a36,000 in real terms \u2013 sector leaders say the biggest risks involve universities that borrowed heavily and are now in danger of breaching the covenants that could force them to repay loans. Two recent reports \u2013 one by PwC and another by the Office for Students (OfS), the higher education regulator for England \u2013 have forecast that 40% of England\u2019s universities will run budget deficits this year. Glen O\u2019Hara, a professor of modern and contemporary history at Oxford Brookes University, said a handful of universities were at \u201cbreaking point\u201d, making the summer admissions round critical. \u201cThere is even the possibility that one or two universities simply won\u2019t be able to go on mid-year, though that is still something of an unlikely nightmare scenario. More likely would be really savage cuts to save the institution from bankruptcy, and likely some local mergers or federal arrangements brokered by the Office for Students and the Department for Education (DfE),\u201d O\u2019Hara said. Earlier this week the OfS launched a tender worth up to \u00a34m for auditors to \u201cundertake financial risk and transformation planning assessments\u201d of universities in England, with the regulator preparing for what the tender described as \u201cpotential market exits\u201d or closures. Maguire, a senior IT executive before entering university leadership, urged the government to seek to help institutions before the situation worsened. \u201cMy experience from working in the private sector is that for every pound you spend before [a crisis] it costs tenfold after. So I think the government is misguided here and they should recognise the severity of the situation. They really ought to be encouraging universities to look for opportunities for merger, for reassessing their provision, and doing this in an organised and controlled fashion,\u201d Maguire said. \u201cThe reality is that universities are massive employers. If a university goes down, the loss of jobs, the cost of dealing with students and the overall impact on the local economy will reflect very badly on the government, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s in anyone\u2019s best interests.\u201d The DfE said: \u201cThe government is acting to establish certainty and sustainability for the higher education sector, securing our universities as engines of growth, excellence and opportunity. \u201cThat is why we are refocusing the role for the OfS, concentrating on key areas including monitoring financial sustainability. We are committed to creating a secure future for our world-leading universities so they can deliver for students, taxpayers, workers and the economy \u2013 and play their part in breaking down the barriers to opportunity.\u201d"

Everywhere I looked, large white caterpillars were marching, searching for more leaves. They even devoured my wild rocket. This is the dreaded \u201ccabbage white\u201d loathed by many gardeners. The caterpillars of the similar-looking small white feed on brassicas too but tend to live singly, and appear to do less damage. And the green-veined white, frequently misnamed as a cabbage white, does not feed on brassicas at all. I\u2019ve grown perennial kale for 10 years and large whites have often laid eggs on the plants, but the caterpillars have never developed before. I had assumed these tougher perennial leaves were not palatable for hungry caterpillars. So it is strange that in one of the worst-ever summers for butterflies I\u2019ve fed a burgeoning large white population. But nature tends to find a balance and a huge proportion of these caterpillars have been parasitised by tiny wasps and will never emerge as late-summer butterflies. Like most insects, butterfly populations frequently plummet and quickly bounce back. The hope is that this year\u2019s apparent bust \u2013 caused by relentless rain in the first half of this year but accentuated by the climate crisis, farm chemicals and habitat loss \u2013 will be followed by a boom.

            "date": "2024-08-29T15:37:25Z",
            "content": "A California bill that would establish first-in-the-nation safety measures for the largest artificial intelligence systems cleared an important vote Wednesday. The proposal, aiming to reduce potential risks created by AI, would require companies to test their models and publicly disclose their safety protocols to prevent the models from being manipulated to, for example, wipe out the state\u2019s electric grid or help build chemical weapons \u2013 scenarios experts say could be possible in the future with such rapid advancements in the industry. The measure squeaked by in the state assembly Wednesday and won procedural approval in the state senate. It now heads to the governor\u2019s desk for his signature, though he has not indicated his position on it. Governor Gavin Newsom has until the end of September to decide whether to sign it into law, veto it or allow it to become law without his signature. He declined to weigh in on the measure earlier this summer but had warned against AI overregulation. Supporters said it would set some of the first much-needed safety ground rules for large-scale AI models in the United States. The bill targets systems that require more than $100m in data to train. No current AI models have hit that threshold. The proposal, authored by Democratic senator Scott Wiener, faced fierce opposition from venture capital firms and tech companies, including OpenAI, Google and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. They say safety regulations should be established by the federal government and that the California legislation takes aim at developers instead of targeting those who use and exploit the AI systems for harm. Wiener said his legislation took a \u201clight touch\u201d approach. \u201cInnovation and safety can go hand in hand \u2013 and California is leading the way,\u201d he said in a statement after the vote. Wiener\u2019s proposal is among dozens of AI bills California lawmakers proposed this year to build public trust, fight algorithmic discrimination and outlaw deepfakes that involve elections or pornography. With AI increasingly affecting the daily lives of Americans, state legislators have tried to strike a balance of reigning in the technology and its potential risks without stifling the booming homegrown industry. California, home of 35 of the world\u2019s top 50 AI companies, has been an early adopter of AI technologies and could soon deploy generative AI tools to address highway congestion and road safety, among other things. Elon Musk, owner of Twitter/X, and founder of xAI, threw his support behind the proposal this week, though he said it was a \u201ctough call\u201d. X operates its own chatbot and image generator, Grok, that has fewer safeguards in place than other prominent AI models. \u201cFor over 20 years, I have been an advocate for AI regulation, just as we regulate any product/technology that is a potential risk to the public,\u201d Musk tweeted. A group of several California house members also opposed the bill, with former House speaker Nancy Pelosi calling it \u201cwell-intentioned but ill informed\u201d. Chamber of Progress, a left-leaning Silicon Valley-funded industry group, said the bill is \u201cbased on science fiction fantasies of what AI could look like\u201d. \u201cThis bill has more in common with Blade Runner or The Terminator than the real world,\u201d senior tech policy director Todd O\u2019Boyle said in a statement after the Wednesday vote. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t hamstring California\u2019s leading economic sector over a theoretical scenario.\u201d The legislation is also supported by Anthropic, an AI startup backed by Amazon and Google, after Wiener adjusted the bill earlier this month to include some of the company\u2019s suggestions. The current bill removed a penalty of perjury provision, limited the state attorney general\u2019s power to sue violators and narrowed the responsibilities of a new AI regulatory agency. Anthropic said in a letter to Newsom that the bill is crucial to prevent catastrophic misuse of powerful AI systems and that \u201cits benefits likely outweigh its costs\u201d. He also slammed critics earlier this week for dismissing potential catastrophic risks from powerful AI models as unrealistic: \u201cIf they really think the risks are fake, then the bill should present no issue whatsoever.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-31T16:02:07Z",
            "content": "The website Easyfundraising calls itself the UK\u2019s \u201cbiggest charity shopping site\u201d, raising millions of pounds for good causes across the country, from leading charities to friends\u2019 groups to support local schools. It says it has raised more than \u00a350m for good causes since it was launched in 2005, describing itself on Facebook as a \u201ccharity organisation\u201d. Brands pay a commission on customers directed to them via the website, with Easyfundraising passing at least half to the good cause chosen by the buyer. But its activities are now being examined the Charity Commission after a complaint from Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who founded the airline easyJet and has an \u201carmy of lawyers\u201d to defend what he considers are infringements of the use of the easy brand. The billionaire\u2019s easyGroup launched legal action against Easyfundraising over the use of the word \u201ceasy\u201d, with a trial concluding last June and judgment expected in the next few months. But his criticism of the company didn\u2019t end there. His legal team cited concerns in court from user reviews that the operation, which is backed by the UK private equity firm Palatine, is using \u201ca charity guise\u201d for an affiliate money-making scheme. Haji-Ioannou originally sent a complaint to the commission in March and has also now cited further evidence provided from the court case. He said it had emerged that only 13% of the good causes on the website are registered charities, and it was an \u201cegregious misrepresentation\u201d for the firm to be described on Facebook as a \u201ccharity organisation\u201d. Haji-Ioannou said: \u201cI believe they can only make money by misleading the donating public that they are a charity \u2013 when in fact they are a very profitable company [backed] by private equity.\u201d Easyfundraising hit back this weekend, saying it is being targeted by what it considered were \u201cmud-slinging tactics\u201d; that users were clearly informed it was a private firm; and that it complies with all relevant charity and fundraising regulations. It says it is not a \u201ctypical fundraising organisation\u201d, but is keen to ensure it meets the highest standard of best practice and clearly communicates that it is a company. Easyfundraising has generally positive views on the review website Trustpilot, but some users complain of repeated notifications and some purchases not being eligible for donations. One user wrote: \u201cI have been sent emails daily encouraging me to spend in order to donate. I have tried to unsubscribe several times.\u201d Alex Heasley, chief customer officer at Easyfundraising, said small good causes across the country, many of which are not registered as charities, were \u201cthe backbone\u201d of the site. She said: \u201cWe don\u2019t solicit donations. We provide a platform or technology for these donations to be raised. If people choose to shop via Easyfundraising, a donation can be raised for their cause.\u201d She said the company slogan promoting the UK\u2019s \u201cbiggest charity shopping site\u201d was not meant to be read in isolation, and users understood and were informed that they were visiting a company website. Heasley said Easyfundraising categorised itself as a \u201ccharity organisation\u201d on Facebook because the social media site did not have a category of \u201cfundraising\u201d platform. She added that users had control over any marketing emails or notifications. The firm says that nine out of 10 of its reviews on Trustpilot are scored at four and five stars. It says a small proportion of purchases may not be eligible for donations, which may include those in which a discount voucher has also been used. Company accounts for the Support Group (UK), whose main activity is providing staff and support services for Easyfundraising, reported turnover of \u00a39.3m in the year to 31 December 2022, with payments of \u00a3578,431 to its directors. It reported a profit of \u00a31.6m. A letter sent to the firm by the Charity Commission in April stated: \u201cThe commission has reviewed the company\u2019s website and whilst it does state at the bottom of the first page of its website that it is a for profit, private company, there are also statements which could be seen as misleading, including that Easyfundraising is the \u2018UK\u2019s biggest charity shopping site\u2019.\u201d The commission said last week its review of the case continues.

            "date": "2024-08-21T17:42:13Z",
            "content": "As the day and Sri Lanka\u2019s innings drew towards its close, with England forced to bowl spin from both ends because it was too dark to safely attempt anything faster, Ollie Pope was one of five players still with sunglasses perched on their heads. At the end of both lunch and tea these players had emerged back into the Manchester gloom with shades in place, just in case things should suddenly and unexpectedly brighten. It was hard not to conclude from this spectacle that this is not just an inherently aggressive team, it is an unfailingly optimistic one. This was Pope\u2019s time to shine. The day had begun with a pre-match huddle that had as many speakers as a night at the Democratic national convention, and incidentally as many voluntarily deposed former leaders named Joe. Ben Stokes spoke at length, Brendon McCullum followed, and Pope as stand-in captain indicated that he knew both his place and the limits of his audience\u2019s patience with some brief concluding remarks, which presumably amounted to: \u201cWhat they said.\u201d On the eve of the match he had promised that the team would hear \u201ca lot of the same messages from a different voice\u201d, and he had been half right. Stokes later described his attitude to watching his team being led by another man. \u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019ve got to trust the person who\u2019s out there to do the job. For this week and the remaining two games it\u2019s going to be Popey,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s got to be the one to make the decisions. I\u2019ve told him: \u2018Look, I\u2019m not going to step on your feet.\u2019\u201d Perhaps, though, it did feel that Pope emerged from that huddle with a few bruised toes. A few minutes later he led his team out into sunshine. For Sri Lanka the gloom descended a little sooner than it did for anyone else: within an hour they were three down; half an hour later the floodlights were on; by mid\u2011afternoon several residents of the on-site hotel, an unseasonally bitter wind blowing across the ground and into their faces as they watched the game from their balconies, had taken to wearing their duvets. Pope\u2019s brightness, meanwhile, remained undimmed. He had lost his first international toss, but any concern that he might be an unlucky leader lasted only as long as it took Dhananjaya de Silva to volunteer for the fate England had planned for him anyway by choosing to bat. And so Pope took to the field, and got busy. The common criticism of Pope\u2019s batting is that he is overly frenetic in the early stages of an innings, but in time settles down. It turns out that he captains in precisely the same way, though it took some time for him to be becalmed. Initially he positioned himself at mid-off, as captains often do, allowing him constant communication with the bowlers and by way of bonus to insist that the ball passed through his hands on its way back to them before each delivery. This at least distracted him from the wilder extremes of fielding micromanagement, though he would come on to those and there were periods \u2013 quite long periods \u2013 when not a ball went past without him nudging someone somewhere. With attention inevitably drawn to the batters\u2019 battle for supremacy against the bowlers, it is not often that you tear your eyes away from the obvious action to watch a captain actually captaining. It can be a surprisingly hectic business, a process of constantly seeking and catching the eyes of teammates, reassuring and questioning, shifting and sticking, applauding and gesticulating. More than anything just so much gesticulating, near-constant windmilling arms: on this occasion not even Pope\u2019s least impactful of adjustments could be described as pointless. At first it all seemed so easy. Dimuth Karunaratne top-edged a pull off Gus Atkinson and was caught behind; Nishan Madushka nicked Chris Woakes to slip; Angelo Mathews was trapped lbw after a mystifying leave, and the first three wickets of the match had fallen before Sri Lanka reached double figures. The last and only time a team batting first in England had lost three wickets for fewer runs it was 1896. By lunch Pope seemed not so much lucky as downright blessed. By then it was 80 for five, and Dinesh Chandimal had just been trapped lbw by a ball that barely bounced, at this stage of the game and on an obviously benign pitch an absolute freak of a delivery. Soon afterwards Kamindu Mendis crashed Woakes through point for four, the bowler changed angle and from round the wicket immediately found the edge, though the way he embraced Mark Wood in the ensuing celebration suggested it was his fellow bowler rather than his captain who was responsible for that flash of inspiration. The true tests were still to come. An attempt to bounce out De Silva and Prabath Jayasuriya felt straight from the Stokes playbook and kind of worked, though the wicket came when Jayasuriya was surprised by one that was pitched up. De Silva and, more unexpectedly, the debutant Milan Rathnayake delayed but could not deny England, and in the end it was Pope himself who ended Sri Lanka\u2019s innings with a smart bit of fielding. For the side temporarily known as his, the day\u2019s play and their insistence on sporting those sunglasses demonstrated and reinforced the same belief: even in those moments when the present is gloomy, the future is bright."

            "content": "The largest English vineyards increased their revenues by 15% last year, as wine investors respond to the climate crisis by planting more vines. While the UK still languishes well down the list of the largest wine-producing nations, below countries such as Uzbekistan and Tunisia, the industry\u2019s output has soared in recent years, rising by 77% last year to 161,960 hectolitres, equivalent to 21.6m bottles. Analysis of Companies House filings for the seven largest vineyards shows that their turnover, led by Kent-based Chapel Down, rose from \u00a332m to \u00a337m last year, more than three times higher than the \u00a313m recorded in 2018-19. One of the drivers for growth has been the \u201cimproved growing conditions in the UK as a result of climate change,\u201d according to accountancy UHY Hacker Young, which reviewed the companies\u2019 accounts. But the flip side of rising global temperatures is the risk that grape production in more traditional wine-producing countries is under threat. \u201cSome of the investment in the UK by foreign wine producers is partly driven by their desire to diversify production away from areas where crop yields are being damaged by climate change,\u201d said UHY Hacker Young partner James Simmonds. \u201cNew investors with deeper pockets are providing new capital for vineyards and are allowing UK winemakers to fund new production,\u201d he added, pointing to vineyard tourism and on-site restaurants proving fertile terroirs for growth. The amount of wine grown in the UK \u2013 the vast majority of which is produced in England and referred to as \u201cEnglish wine\u201d \u2013 has increased significantly and has led to producers such as Chapel Down, Gusborne and Roebuck Estate winning acclaim on the world stage. South-eastern England is conducive to the production of sparkling wine in particular, due to the similarity of its topography to the Champagne region of France. But total output remains tiny in comparison with powerhouses such as France, Italy and Spain. France, the world leader, produced 48m hectolitres (mhl) in 2024, about a fifth of the global total and nearly 300 times the UK\u2019s output. However, the second- and third-placed wine-producing nations, Italy and Spain, witnessed a decline in production, with the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) highlighting climate effects such as drought and heavy rain. Of the OIV\u2019s list of 21 \u201cmajor\u201d producers, Switzerland ranks last, with 1 mhl of wine flowing from its vineyards in 2023, about six times UK output."

            "date": "2024-08-29T17:14:13Z",
            "content": "Shares in the chip designer Nvidia have fallen after investors were spooked by signs of slowing growth and production issues, despite the artificial intelligence company posting a 122% rise in second-quarter revenues compared with the same period last year. The Silicon Valley company\u2019s revenues for the period more than doubled to $30bn (\u00a323bn), beating average analyst estimates of $28.7bn. However, investors were concerned about signs of a slowdown in growth, in particular around its next-generation AI chips, codenamed Blackwell. The stock fell as much as 7% in pre-market trading, before paring back losses to a 3.4% fall as of midday trading on New York\u2019s Nasdaq. The chipmaker is the third most valuable company in the world, with a market value of $3.1tn. The sudden drop in its share price wiped more than $100bn (\u00a376bn) from its stock market value. Nvidia\u2019s partial recovery after its early morning decline appeared to buoy other tech stocks and chipmakers during Thursday trading. Google, Apple and Amazon, as well as the chip designer Arm holdings, all saw their stock prices rise as of midday. Nvidia said the delivery of its Blackwell chips \u2013 which comprise 208bn transistors that carry out calculations to train its large language model \u2013 would be delayed by several months from January. Its chief executive, Jensen Huang, has previously said that Blackwell would generate \u201ca lot of revenue\u201d for the business this year. Simon French, the chief economist and head of research at the investment bank Panmure Liberum told the BBC: \u201cThere were just some signs around the edges in numbers that that rate of growth was trying to slow. Their current AI chip \u2018hopper\u2019 is selling well, but the next one, the next generation Blackwell, has faced some production delays, and that perhaps is one of the reasons why Wall Street, after hours, sold off the stock.\u201d Nvidia bosses did not detail the extent of the delay for Blackwell deliveries but said manufacturing issues had been addressed by TSMC, the Taiwanese semiconductor firm that builds the US company\u2019s most advanced chips. They added that early samples were now shipping to a small group of customers. The drop in Nvidia\u2019s share price dragged on US markets, in particular the S&amp;P 500 index. Nvidia makes up about 6% of the total value of the index and has helped drive its gains this year, after rising more than 160% over the past 12 months. Matt Britzman, an analyst at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said Nvidia was facing the challenge of how to match the hype. \u201cIt\u2019s less about just beating estimates now, markets expect them to be shattered and it\u2019s the scale of the beat that looks to have disappointed a touch.\u201d While many investors have bought into the theoretical impact of artificial intelligence and claims that it could transform nearly every global industry, French noted that the practical use cases \u201chaven\u2019t yet been proven\u201d. \u201cSuch are the lofty expectations for this stock, not just as a single company, but its broader economic impact. If you\u2019re going to raise expectations that high, then you\u2019ve got to keep growing at spectacular rates,\u201d he said. However, Britzman cautioned against reading too much into the market reaction, given that investors tended to \u201coverstate\u201d the importance of one set of quarterly results, particularly in the \u201cgrand scheme of AI\u201d prospects. Instead, he said companies such as Microsoft, Tesla and the Facebook and Instagram owner, Meta, were working on a \u201cmulti-year, even multi-decade, time frame and investors would be wise to adopt a similar mentality\u201d. He added: \u201cThe question of return on investment, that many AI bears [sceptics] fall back on, simply isn\u2019t the main consideration for Nvidia\u2019s biggest customers at this stage. Like many before, this cycle won\u2019t be a straight line, but while the \u2018build it and they will come\u2019 approach continues, it plays right into Nvidia\u2019s hands.\u201d"

            "content": "We shouldn\u2019t judge a book by its cover. Nor judge a research paper by its title. \u201cDiscussion paper No.5: Public investment and potential output\u201d, just published by the Office for Budget Responsibility, doesn\u2019t sound like a barrel of laughs. But unenticing is not the same as unimportant. This is the official forecaster telling us what economic impact it expects public investment \u2013 public spending that creates an asset, like a road or hospital \u2013 to have. Policy debates normally focus on public investment\u2019s growth impact through the lens of what it does immediately to the demand side of the economy (for example, creating construction jobs, something particularly valuable in a recession). But that impact is mainly temporary (the OBR estimates it disappears after three years). So this unassuming paper focuses on what public investment does to the economy\u2019s supply side \u2013 not creating work today, but raising the UK\u2019s ability to produce goods and services tomorrow (for example, because we have a properly functioning transport system). It finds \u201ca sustained 1% of GDP increase in public investment could plausibly increase the level of potential output by just under 0.5% after five years and around 2.5% in the long run.\u201d The lessons? Not just the obvious one that investment is a long game, given that building takes time and the flow of new investment is small v the stock of public sector assets. But the impact isn\u2019t just long term. It\u2019s big. That 2.5% compares to the 4% estimated economic hit from Brexit. Of course, it matters what you invest in and whether projects are delivered on time and budget (unlike HS2).

            "date": "2024-08-18T05:00:19Z",
            "content": "Public sector pay has fallen by 2.5% in real terms since 2010, while private sector pay rose by just under 4% in the same period. Nurses\u2019 pay fell by 6.5%; teachers\u2019 by even more at 9%. These are the facts that underpin the chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019s decision that public sector workers will get an above-inflation pay rise this year, in line with the 5.5% recommended by the independent pay review bodies. These increases are needed not just as a matter of fairness for teachers, nurses and doctors but because falling real rates of public sector pay are compounding the recruitment and retention issues facing hospitals, schools and other public services. That has not stopped the Conservative opposition launching the familiar claim that the government is in the pockets of its trade union paymasters. On Friday, Kevin Hollinrake, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cThe unions are now back in charge and the country will pay the price.\u201d That is disingenuous in the extreme. The last Conservative government sought to make fiscal savings by suppressing public sector pay. While it may have reduced the size of the overall pay bill \u2013 and some of the lowest-paid workers, such as teaching assistants, were relatively protected \u2013 the strategy lowered morale and created a staffing crisis across the public sector. In the NHS, there are more than 121,000 vacancies, with the most deprived areas worst affected. The National Foundation for Educational Research has said that \u201cteacher supply is in a critical state that risks the quality of education that children and young people receive\u201d; last year, teacher recruitment targets were missed in 10 subjects. Recruitment issues mean that hospitals and schools have to rely more heavily on extortionately expensive agency workers in the short term. Labour has made recruiting more NHS workers and teachers a centrepiece of its public sector reform plans; it cannot achieve this without pay rises, recommended by independent panels based on the evidence, including on living standards and recruitment and retention. So Reeves was entirely right to indicate that she will accept the recommendations of the public sector pay review bodies. But where is the \u00a39.4bn a year that will cost to come from? Reeves has adopted the arbitrary and over-conservative fiscal rule of her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, that debt must be forecast to be falling as a share of GDP in five years; she has also limited herself to borrowing only to fund investment, not day-to-day running costs. Schools and hospitals do not have enough room in their already stretched budgets to fund these increases from their existing allocations: it will require extra money that, in light of these rules, will have to come either from cuts elsewhere or from tax increases. This speaks to perhaps the single biggest existential issue facing the government. Its economic inheritance was unenviable: sluggish productivity growth, decades of poor levels of business investment, all made worse by Brexit. Record numbers of working-age people are economically inactive. Meanwhile, everywhere you look there are demands on public spending: from a chronically underfunded NHS, to the services for vulnerable adults and children that suffered 14 years of spending cuts, to rising child poverty driven by reductions in financial support for low-income parents; the poorest 10% of families with children lost a staggering \u00a36,000 a year on average between 2010 and 2024 as a result of changes to the tax and benefit system. To make things worse, Labour has accepted the Conservative baseline for public spending, which bakes in another round of unfeasible spending cuts. This is by far the chancellor\u2019s biggest headache. Her answer is that Labour will grow the country out of these problems, driving increases in living standards but also raising tax revenues that can be used to repair the public infrastructure and services that have been so badly damaged by successive Conservative chancellors. The problem is that Labour\u2019s plan for growth is missing substance. It is heavily reliant on ambitious targets for housebuilding that Reeves hopes will be delivered primarily through planning reforms, and on the belief that modest public investment in an area such as the green transition can leverage in enough private investment to provide the boost the economy needs. Labour could get lucky, but the risk is that this is nowhere near enough to deliver growth on the scale needed. Labour significantly scaled back its public investment plans before the last election; reports suggest that Reeves may further cut back on planned investment projects for which the last government did not set aside funding. And growth will be hard to deliver without investing in the health and employment services needed to reduce rates of worklessness. The truth is that fiscal conservatism proved a good electoral strategy for Labour, but it falls badly short as a governing philosophy. There are things the government must do immediately, as a moral imperative, such as improving financial support to children living in poverty. And other areas of spending are necessary to achieve growth. Public sector pay is just the start of it. Reeves can find extra resources from taxation, for example through reforming capital gains and inheritance taxes to ensure that the wealthiest make a fairer contribution. But she also needs to adopt a more flexible approach to borrowing to fund the public infrastructure without which healthy growth is likely to remain a pipe dream."

            "title": "UK economy continues recovery from recession with GDP growth of 0.6%",
            "date": "2024-08-15T12:33:26Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy has extended its recovery from recession after recording growth of 0.6% in the three months to June, handing a boost to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in the run-up to the autumn budget. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show gross domestic product continued to grow in the second quarter, after a rise of 0.7% in the first three months of 2024. The reading matched the forecasts of City economists. However, monthly GDP growth was flat in June as wet weather deterred shoppers from spending in what has been a washout summer for retailers. Ben Jones, the lead economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said the figures showed the economy had \u201cfinally shaken off its slumber of recent years\u201d, but warned there were still challenges to sustainably boosting Britain\u2019s long-term growth rate. \u201cWe think the quarterly data probably overstates the underlying momentum in the economy, with recent CBI surveys of activity remaining fairly subdued,\u201d he said. \u201cBut firms nonetheless appear confident that the recovery will continue.\u201d According to the latest snapshot, service sector output increased by 0.8% in the second quarter, powered by scientific research and development. There was also strength in the IT, transport, law, architecture and engineering sectors. Consumer-facing service output fell by 0.1%, reflecting a weaker period for purchases of physical goods amid the cost of living crisis and poor weather hitting retail sales. Manufacturing and construction output also fell. The UK has grown at a faster pace this year than many forecasters predicted, in a development seized on by the shadow chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, as evidence that the previous government had helped the economy to turn a corner. \u201cToday\u2019s figures are yet further proof that Labour have inherited a growing and resilient economy. The chancellor\u2019s attempt to blame her economic inheritance on her decision to raise taxes \u2013 tax rises she had always planned \u2013 will not wash with the public,\u201d he said. The latest figures show the UK recorded the strongest growth in the G7 group of advanced economies over the past six months. The second-quarter growth rate of 0.6% compares with 0.3% in the eurozone, and 0.7% in the US. However, it comes after a lacklustre performance over the past decade, and high living costs, elevated interest rates and faltering productivity gains are acting as a brake on momentum. The UK economy entered recession \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of falling GDP \u2013 in the second half of last year as households cut back on spending. Reeves has said rebooting the economy is Labour\u2019s number one priority, arguing that stronger growth will help to boost living standards and raise more tax revenue to repair battered public services. The chancellor will deliver an autumn budget on 30 October. \u201cThe new government is under no illusion as to the scale of the challenge we have inherited after more than a decade of low economic growth and a \u00a322bn black hole in the public finances,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why we have made economic growth our national mission and we are taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations, so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of the country better off.\u201d Experts said the recent strength in the economy would be unlikely to last. Earlier this month, the Bank of England raised its growth forecast from 0.5% to 1.25% for 2024, but warned of a weaker medium-term outlook as high interest rates hit activity. Figures released on Wednesday showed inflation rose by less than expected in July to 2.2%. The continued strong GDP growth in the second quarter of the year may mean that the Bank delays interest rate cuts until past September, according to financial market bets. The Bank is expected to leave rates unchanged at 5% when rate-setters meet next month, before making a 0.25%-point rate cut at the following meeting in November. Much of the recent expansion has been driven by a growing population. The latest figures showed GDP per head, an important barometer of living standards, was 0.1% lower than a year earlier in the second quarter, and 0.8% below pre-pandemic levels. Simon Pittaway, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cBritain\u2019s medium-term record is far less impressive, and has been driven by a growing population rather than rising productivity. \u201cWithout a return to productivity growth, living standards will continue to stagnate and Britain will continue to fall behind its peers.\u201d"

Really substantial savings can be found only if there are valuable assets that can be disposed of \u2013 principally land and buildings. There is also a very real risk of a loss of institutional identity and therefore diversity and choice, as previously quite different providers are brigaded together and some socially vital missions disappear. Finally, no one should underestimate the challenges of relocating students and staff. Unfortunately, the only solution to the problem is to fund universities properly to provide the valuable public goods that only they can provide. The long-term strategy of shifting all the costs of teaching on to individual graduates has to be brought to an end.

            "date": "2024-08-04T05:00:22Z",
            "content": "Alastair Miller claims there have been \u201cyears of well-funded research\u201d into ME (\u201cMaeve Boothby-O\u2019Neill\u2019s harrowing case highlights clashing NHS narratives on ME\u201d). We disagree. UK research funding for myalgic encephalomyelitis has been demonstrably insufficient compared with the high symptom burden and with other diseases. From 2015\u20132020, just \u00a36m was committed in funding for ME research through the National Institute for Health and Care Research and UK Research and Innovation, compared with \u00a353m for Parkinson\u2019s disease and \u00a322m for multiple sclerosis. There has been an increase worldwide in research funding for long Covid, including some investments in the UK. As Dr Miller points out, the two conditions overlap considerably. Yet this has been nowhere near sufficient to recover lost ground from decades of underfunding. Since 23 July, 1,400 patients and carers have signed our open letter calling for \u00a3100m annual funding for ME and long Covid biomedical research. #ThereForME, a patient and carer-led campaign backed by 18 organisations, is calling for an NHS that\u2019s there for people with ME and long Covid. Our report, drawing on experiences from over 300 people affected, emphasises the need to leverage the UK\u2019s science and technology expertise to accelerate treatments. Now, more than ever, we should heed Boothby-O\u2019Neill\u2019s words: \u201cMy only hope lies in biomedical research, and adequate funding for this requires the medical establishment to set aside the inaccurate idea that behavioural treatments can cure ME.\u201d Doctors rely on high-quality research studies for the evidence base that good medicine depends on. Karen Hargrave and Emma Gore-Lloyd, Founders of #ThereForME Alastair Miller is correct to say that the NHS needs to provide rapid access to multidisciplinary clinics where diagnosis can be confirmed and guidance on management provided. This was recommended in the new (October 2021) Nice guideline on ME/CFS. However, some of the key recommendations on management, especially the removal of graded execise therapy, were opposed by the Royal College of Physicians. Around 25% of people with ME/CFS are severely affected \u2013 often resulting in constant pain, severely reduced mobility, hypersensitivity to light, sound and touch and problems with eating, swallowing and digestion of food. At the severest end of the spectrum are a group permanently bedbound who may require tube feeding to prevent life-threatening malnutrition \u2013 as was the case with Boothby-O\u2019Neill. The Nice guideline on ME/CFS contains clear recommendations on care and management in the home and in hospital. Sadly, many health professionals remain unaware of them; a significant proportion of specialist referral clinics are still not able to provide a care and management service or plan for those with severe ME/CFS; and there are no longer any hospitals with dedicated medical units for those who require specialist in-patient care. Health service commissioners must urgently review their specialist care of people with severe ME/CFS to make sure this is consistent with the Nice recommendations. Where no care at all is provided, this can no longer be ignored. Otherwise, there will be more unnecessary deaths. Dr Charles Shepherd, hon medical adviser, ME Association; member, Nice guideline committee on ME/CFS Gawcot, Bucks Strictly fun I agree with Sonia Sodha that Strictly needs another format (\u201cThe perfect feelgood TV, did Strictly\u2019s sparkle blind it to flaws in its format?\u201d). The highly strung, well-trained professionals need to be aware this is a \u201cfun\u201d show, not a competition between other professionals but amateurs daring to enter their world of gruelling training and performances. The professionals should make allowances for lack of stamina, as well as the ability to learn things. I worked in the NHS as a medical secretary and had a few sharp encounters with highly strung doctors who expected ancillary staff to have the same knowledge as them. It was fortunate that I was experienced and old enough to stand up for myself. Irene McWatt Littlehampton, West Sussex Time\u2019s up for polluters Stewart Lee notes that Nuremberg-style trials will ensue due to the mass killing of all life on Earth (\u201cThe end is nigh. For insects, bats, protest, the planet\u2026\u201d). That will be sooner than he may realise. The UK Youth Climate Coalition has a case at the international criminal court against BP, and Climate Genocide Act Now has a case there against five senior UK politicians. The legal profession is doing what it can to stall the inevitable, but justice is coming. Jon Fuller Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex Abolish all prisons I appreciated Eva Wiseman\u2019s column about the urgent need for prison abolition for the roughly 3,600 women in prison in the UK (\u201cWomen\u2019s prisons have served their time. They should be abolished\u201d). However, I did wonder why she stopped short of calling for the abolition of men\u2019s prisons. Although there are more violent offenders in men\u2019s prisons than in women\u2019s, the majority of men are there for non-violent offences. There were 92 suicides in prisons in the UK in the year to September 2023, of which 91 were men. This makes the suicide rate in men\u2019s prisons nearly four times higher than men in the general population. Men are also cut off from their children, and children from their fathers. Only 38% of men were offered a phone call to their family on their first night in prison, compared with 73% of women. During my medical training, I shadowed the healthcare teams in women\u2019s and men\u2019s prisons. I was shocked by the terrible living conditions, very high rates of mental ill health and pervasive violence and substance misuse. Women and men in prison deserve comfort, safety and the opportunity to build a better life. Let\u2019s end prisons and build better systems for all. Dr Charlie Wilkinson Hotwells, Bristol Discrimination is diverse James Baldwin wrote eloquently and perceptively about white American racism (\u201cJames Baldwin taught us that identities can help us to locate ourselves. But they trap us too\u201d). But he was less attuned to the forms of discrimination of others, including his own. It is often forgotten that Baldwin spoke at times in condescending and ignorant ways of Africans. It was not their colour that offended him; it was what he perceived \u2013 utterly wrongly \u2013 as their lack of culture. Chinua Achebe gently critiqued Baldwin\u2019s ignorance of African culture, ancient and modern, even as he honoured Baldwin\u2019s many critical contributions to American literature and life. We should be mindful of the diverse ways in which racism and discrimination manifest. Anti-African racism is not always based on colour but also on contempt for African culture and civilisation and disregard for their depth and diversity, let alone their existence and rich history. In that regard we must read Achebe alongside Baldwin and incorporate African voices unmediated by the American experience in our studies of racism and discrimination. Dr Noam Schimmel University of California, Berkeley Hungry? I have a solution James Tapper writes about children going hungry (\u201c\u2018Will the kids eat or not?\u2019 In Keir Starmer\u2019s constituency, families struggle with poverty\u201d). Despite your coverage of hunger, I have not seen an article offering a solution. As a Sikh, I am well aware that a gurdwara offers a free, hot and healthy meal throughout the day to visitors \u2013 all delivered by volunteers. Regardless of religious affiliation, visitors are welcome, so long as they are respectful that they are in a holy place. Food banks are not the only place to alleviate hunger in this country.

            "title": "Was Kamala Harris\u2019s big interview a success? Sort of | Moira Donegan",
            "date": "2024-08-30T14:26:15Z",
            "content": "How much of an incentive does Kamala Harris really have to lay out a thorough policy agenda? With fewer than 70 days until the general election, the newly official Democratic presidential nominee has exited her party\u2019s Chicago convention riding a a wave of tight but improving poll numbers and tremendous party goodwill. Her move to the top of the ticket has prompted waves of enthusiasm and barely concealed relief, as young voters and weary Democrats greeted the happy prospect of an election campaign that was, at last, not between Biden and Trump. The shift of candidates initiated a new shift in the campaign\u2019s voice, with a more playful, irreverent and optimistic turn coming to characterize the Democrats\u2019 public messaging. When the vibes are this good, few people ask about specifics. There are pitfalls, too, for a politician who is too precise about what they aim to do in office. After all, much of the Democrats\u2019 2024 campaigning has featured deep dives into Project 2025, the 900-plus-page policy prescription for a second Trump term that was compiled by conservative thinktanks under the auspices of the Heritage Foundation. Democrats, including Harris herself, have used the document as a near-depthless well of possible attacks, making each one of the plan\u2019s copious number of proposals into an attack that they can make Republicans answer for. As Harris heads into the final weeks of the campaign, one can see a certain cynical logic to her imprecise policy positions: why would she bother painting a target on her own back? So maybe it\u2019s not surprising that on Thursday night, in her first major interview since ascending to the presidential nomination, the vice-president did not seem interested in making any news. She was competent, personable and a forceful defender of the Biden administration; she was attentive to issues where her campaign believes her to be vulnerable, such as on immigration and energy policy; and she was deliberate in depicting herself as a hawkish advocate for stricter border controls. She did not talk much about her opponent, Donald Trump, brushing off a question from CNN\u2019s Dana Bash about his recent slanderous claim that Harris had only recently \u201cturned Black\u201d. She did not endorse an arms embargo to Israel, whose genocidal war in Gaza has killed upwards of 40,000 Palestinians with the aid of American weapons. And with the exception of a few economic proposals \u2013 like for an expansion of the child tax credit, a $25,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers and a repeat of her promise to punish price gauging \u2013 she was light on specifics. The interview seemed to be less about presenting a policy vision for the American people than about presenting them with a character. The character that emerged in the form of Vice-President Harris was one who is confident, intelligent and at ease with her authority; one who was unfazed by Bash\u2019s sometimes pointed questioning, in part because she has mastered the art of the dodge. Among the interview\u2019s surprising omissions was abortion, the issue that has redefined the status, health and civil rights of half of Americans as a result of the presidency of her opponent. The word was only mentioned once over the course of the interview, when the vice-presidential nominee, Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, mentioned the issue as something that voters were more interested in than his own previous verbal gaffes. He\u2019s probably right that voters care more about it, but both he and Harris declined to address the issue further. Harris, historically a forceful advocate for abortion rights who was largely tasked with campaigning on the issue while Biden was still in the race, seemed to demur from the historical nature of her candidacy more broadly. When Bash asked her about a viral photo from the Democratic national convention \u2013 which pictured Harris at the podium, being gazed up at by her great-niece, a pigtailed young girl \u2013 she avoided the question\u2019s implicit inquiry into how she feels about the prospect of becoming the nation\u2019s first female president. Harris said only that she was running because she believed herself to be the best person for the job, and that she aimed to be a president for Americans of all races and genders. It was a nice sentiment, and probably even true. But her words avoided the gender issue that has come to shape the campaign, and left aside an opportunity to rally voters in the 10 states that will have abortion rights measures on the ballot in November. If anyone in the Harris campaign feels that electing a woman president now, in this post-Dobbs era, could be a righteous rebuke to the backward and bigoted misogyny that has come to define the Trump-Vance ticket, then that is not an argument they are interested in having their candidate make. Harris will be criticized on the left for her refusal to endorse an arms embargo to Israel, whose war has become a generational moral catastrophe that threatens to destabilize the region. When asked about the conflict, Harris spoke of the atrocities of 7 October in lurid terms; of the unfathomable human cost that has been imposed on Palestinians, she said only that \u201cfar too many innocent Palestinians have been killed\u201d. (An unfortunate phrase that implies that there is an acceptable number of innocents that Israel can murder.) Her unwillingness to speak with more empathy and commitment about this issue threatens to alienate young voters, a disorganized but growing left, and the large cohorts of Muslim and Arab voters she needs to win over in places like Minnesota and Michigan. That unwillingness also threatens to give more credence to other leftwing suspicions of Harris, such as the marginal but noticeable suspicion among activists over whether she will maintain Biden\u2019s enthusiasm for antitrust enforcement. Maybe Harris is calculating that these voters have nowhere else to go; maybe she just doesn\u2019t really share their values on these issues. But the central argument for her candidacy is about values: that she is a more moral, more principled, more trustworthy candidate than Donald Trump; that she will bring less bigotry, less selfishness, less recklessness and less tedious narcissism to the White House. It\u2019s a low bar, but she still has to clear it. If Harris\u2019s campaign is about values, but she is unwilling to more forcefully champion women\u2019s rights and the value of Palestinian lives, she risks making some wonder just what those values are.

            "title": "Team GB was an Olympic triumph of public spending. Now can we please invest in everyone else   | David Goldblatt",
            "date": "2024-08-12T09:00:37Z",
            "content": "In the early 20th century, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) refused to publish medals tables, considering them vulgar and a goad to competitive nationalism rather than the cooperative internationalism that the Games were meant to nurture. It heartily disapproved of the US press which invented them as part of its coverage of the 1908 London Games as a way of selling papers and tracking the US\u2019s sporting ascent and Britain\u2019s decline. The IOC has since made its peace with the medals table, and at each Games it is offered \u2013 especially for those at the top \u2013 as a measure of national prowess and power. How then to read Team GB\u2019s performance at Paris 2024, seventh in the table with 14 golds and 65 medals in total? By the first two criteria, this marks a decline from the highs of London 2012 (29 golds and third in the table) and Rio 2016 (27 golds and second in the table), though that this should appear disappointing is a measure of the transformation of UK elite sport since the Olympic nadir of Atlanta 1996 where the UK won just one gold medal and finished 36th in the rankings. That said, the total number of medals won is about the same as recent Olympics and, given the small margins of elite competition, the UK could easily have finished higher up the table. In this light, Paris 2024 is confirmation that the UK has, given its population size, sporting cultures and wealth \u2013 the main determinants of Olympic success \u2013 performed at least as well as it should; not overperforming like Australia (18 golds with a smaller population) but better than Italy or Germany or Canada. Given where the UK ends up in most tables of international comparison these days, this is no mean feat. The key reason for this is that for more than a quarter of a century the Treasury and the national lottery have, though UK Sport, been directing about \u00a3100m a year to elite sport, with a ruthless allocation process focusing funds on potential medallists. Of course, UK Sport has been well managed, and innovative cultures of coaching and development have been pioneered in key sports such as cycling, but the money is the most important thing. Since the Olympics abandoned amateurism in 1992, success is simply all but impossible without access to high-level facilities, coaching and funding. Given that very few sports have a commercial form that can sustain a serious pool of elite athletes in full-time training (and the US model of college sport is not replicable here), state sinecures \u2013 like in many other nations \u2013 are the bedrock of British success. Has it been a good investment? Certainly, there has been a lot of excitement, entertainment, joy and pride; all of which is good. While the anti-migrant riots that raged alongside the Games have been fuelled by an ugly racist component, Team GB has been a celebration of our diversity. However, other longer-term public benefits are harder to discern. Certainly levels of participation in sport and everyday physical activity \u2013 a central rationale for investing in elite sport \u2013 have not significantly risen alongside our Olympic success. This was always a quixotic hope. Olympians are exceptional rather than the norm, their motivations and practices quite different from much of the population. No amount of sport on television, and no amount of gold medal ceremonies, have been able to arrest the long-term decline in young people\u2019s activity rates, the obesity crisis, or the sedentary nature of most of our lives. Given that, if we want to take a positive message away from Paris 2024, it is that targeted public investment works. Yes, it matters how and where it is spent, but whatever the patterns of causation, there is absolutely no chance of transforming the activity rate, and the mental and physical health of the nation, without spending a lot more money, especially in poorer areas. Sport England, and its equivalents in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which are responsible for developing grassroots sport, are working with a budget of about \u00a3250m for the whole country; a figure so small, in terms of public expenditure, that it would otherwise only buy a handful of fighter jets or a single large hospital. Local authorities responsible for leisure centres and community sport have been devastated by 14 years of austerity and are closing swimming pools, selling off green spaces and spending less than half of what they did on recreation a decade and a half ago. In any reasonable model of public accounting, a sustained investment in the nation\u2019s playing fields, sporting facilities, school sports, community programmes and, above all, staffing \u2013 in the billions rather than millions \u2013 and a similar level of investment in making walking and cycling the norm for urban transport, would be an immediate priority with huge and obvious health and economic benefits. At a fraction of the cost, it would deliver better and more egalitarian outcomes than the \u00a311bn we spend on the roads every year, and given the scale of sickness at work, deliver a greater boost to the nation\u2019s productivity. The UK\u2019s Olympic athletic model may not get us off the sofa, but if we were to adopt its ambition, focus and scale up the funding, it might: and that would be an Olympic legacy without parallel.

            "title": "Countries fueling Israel\u2019s Gaza war may be complicit in war crimes, experts warn",
            "date": "2024-08-20T12:30:45Z",
            "content": "Israeli tanks, jets and bulldozers bombarding Gaza and razing homes in the occupied West Bank are being fueled by a growing number of countries signed up to the genocide and Geneva conventions, new research suggests, which legal experts warn could make them complicit in serious crimes against the Palestinian people. Four tankers of American jet fuel primarily used for military aircraft have been shipped to Israel since the start of its aerial bombardment of Gaza in October. Three shipments departed from Texas after the landmark international court of justice (ICJ) ruling on 26 January ordered Israel to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza. The ruling reminded states that under the genocide convention they have a \u201ccommon interest to ensure the prevention, suppression and punishment of genocide\u201d. Overall, almost 80% of the jet fuel, diesel and other refined petroleum products supplied to Israel by the US over the past nine months was shipped after the January ruling, according to the new research commissioned by the non-profit Oil Change International and shared exclusively with the Guardian. Researchers analyzed shipping logs, satellite images and other open-source industry data to track 65 oil and fuel shipments to Israel between 21 October last year and 12 July. It suggests a handful of countries \u2013 Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Gabon, Nigeria, Brazil and most recently the Republic of the Congo and Italy \u2013 have supplied 4.1m tons of crude oil to Israel, with almost half shipped since the ICJ ruling. An estimated two-thirds of crude came from investor-owned and private oil companies, according to the research, which is refined by Israel for domestic, industrial and military use. Israel relies heavily on crude oil and refined petroleum imports to run its large fleet of fighter jets, tanks and other military vehicles and operations, as well as the bulldozers implicated in clearing Palestinian homes and olive groves to make way for unlawful Israeli settlements. In response to the new findings, UN and other international law experts called for an energy embargo to prevent further human rights violations against the Palestinian people \u2013 and an investigation into any oil and fuels shipped to Israel that have been used to aid acts of alleged genocide and other serious international crimes. \u201cAfter the 26 January ICJ ruling, states cannot claim they did not know what they were risking to partake in,\u201d said Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory, adding that under international law, states have obligations to prevent genocide and respect and ensure respect for the Geneva conventions. The official death toll in Gaza has almost doubled to at least 40,000 since the ICJ ruling, with thousands more Palestinians maimed, injured and missing under the rubble, presumed dead since Israel launched its retaliation for the deadly attack by Hamas on 7 October. About 96% or 2.15 million Palestinians are facing crisis levels of hunger, with food sources destroyed by military attacks and humanitarian aid severely curtailed. \u201cIn the case of the US jet-fuel shipments, there are serious grounds to believe that there is a breach of the genocide convention for failure to prevent and disavowal of the ICJ January ruling and provisional measures,\u201d said Albanese. \u201cOther countries supplying oil and other fuels absolutely also warrant further investigation.\u201d In early August, a tanker delivered an estimated 300,000 barrels of US jet fuel to Israel after being unable to dock in Spain or Gibraltar amid mounting protests and warnings from international legal experts. Days later, more than 50 groups wrote to the Greek government calling for a war-crimes investigation after satellite images showed the vessel in Greek waters. Last week, the US released $3.5bn to Israel to spend on US-made weapons and military equipment, despite reports from UN human rights experts and other independent investigations that Israeli forces are violating international law in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. A day later, the US approved a further $20bn in weapons sales, including 50 fighter jets, tank ammunition and tactical vehicles. The sale and transfer of jet fuel \u2013 and arms \u2013 \u201cincrease the ability of Israel, the occupying power, to commit serious violations\u201d, according to the UN human rights council resolution in March. The US is the biggest supplier of fuel and weapons to Israel. Its policy was unchanged by the ICJ ruling, according to the White House. \u201cThe case for the US\u2019s complicity in genocide is very strong,\u201d said Dr Shahd Hammouri, lecturer in international law at the University of Kent and the author of Shipments of Death. \u201cIt\u2019s providing material support, without which the genocide and other illegalities are not possible. The question of complicity for the other countries will rely on assessment of how substantial their material support has been.\u201d Brazil, where President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has been one of the sharpest critics of Israel, accounts for 9% of the total crude oil supplied to Israel in the past nine months. One of the crude shipments departed in February after the interim ICJ ruling. An additional tanker of fuel oil, used mostly for heating and powering generators, set sail in April. Lula withdrew Brazil\u2019s ambassador to Israel, but has not issued a ban on oil exports. \u201cThe clock started after the ICJ ruling, but there was already a general obligation for states under the Geneva convention to respect, enforce and ensure enforcement of international humanitarian law, which is clearly not happening,\u201d added Albanese. A spokesperson for the Brazilian president\u2019s office said oil and fuel trades were carried out directly by the private sector according to market rules: \u201cAlthough the government\u2019s stance on Israel\u2019s current military action in Gaza is well known, Brazil\u2019s traditional position on sanctions is to not apply or support them unilaterally.\u201d Azerbaijan, the largest supplier of crude to Israel since October, will host the 29th UN climate summit in November, followed by Brazil in 2025. \u201cThe inconsistency of the states is worrisome, as the future Cop hosts send oil to an unlawful occupation and alleged genocide. It shows how far we are from compliance with climate commitments and international law, and the urgent need to change course,\u201d said Astrid Puentes Ria\u00f1o, UN special rapporteur on the human right to a healthy environment. A spokesperson for the Israeli ministry of foreign affairs said the charges of genocide brought by South Africa are \u201cfalse, outrageous and morally repugnant \u2026 [Hamas] sought to perpetrate genocide on October 7 in the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, [and] is directly responsible for the suffering of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. \u201cIsrael remains steadfast in its commitment to international law, targeting its military actions solely against Hamas and its allied terrorist groups. The Israeli military makes every effort to minimize civilian casualties and ensure that humanitarian aid reaches those in need in the Gaza Strip.\u201d The Biden administration did not respond to requests for comment, nor did Vice-President Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential election campaign team. *** Israel is a small country with a relatively large army and air force. It has no operational cross-border fossil fuel pipelines, and relies heavily on maritime imports. The new research by Data Desk, a UK-based tech consultancy firm investigating the fossil fuel industry, draws on ship positions, commodity trade flows, information from port authorities, shipbrokers and satellite imagery, as well as financial and media reports to track the fuel supply chain between 21 October and 12 July. Israel has two refineries to convert crude oil into fuels for domestic, military and industrial use. According to the EIA, each barrel of crude is converted into gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, as well refined products such as asphalt and petrochemicals \u2013 depending on the grade of the oil, the refinery and demand. The new data suggests: Half the crude oil in this period came from Azerbaijan (28%) and Kazakhstan (22%). Azeri crude is delivered via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, majority-owned and operated by BP. The crude oil is loaded on to tankers at the Turkish port of Ceyhan for delivery to Israel. Turkey recently submitted a formal bid to join South Africa\u2019s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ. African countries supplied 37% of the total crude, with 22% coming from Gabon, 9% from Nigeria and 6% from the Republic of the Congo. In Europe, companies in Italy, Greece and Albania appear to have supplied refined petroleum products to Israel since the ICJ ruling. Last month, Israel also received crude from Italy \u2013 a major oil importer. A spokesperson said the Italian government had \u201cno information\u201d about the recent shipments. Cyprus provided transshipment services to tankers supplying crude oil from Gabon, Nigeria, and Kazakhstan. Some fuel from refineries goes directly to the armed forces, while much of the rest appears to go to ordinary gas stations where military personnel can refuel their vehicles under a government contract. It is not possible to link specific crude shipments to specific military use from the available data. Israeli tanks have diesel engines, as do commercial bulldozers. Israel has received diesel shipments from Greece and the US since 26 January. It also converts crude into diesel fuel at its refineries, suggesting that oil imports are probably contributing to land military operations in the Gaza Strip, where 2 million Palestinians are trapped, as well as the expansion of settlements that even its allies accept are unlawful. The existing obligation for states not to assist or collaborate with illegal occupations was confirmed by the ICJ in a separate landmark advisory opinion in July, that found Israel\u2019s annexation, settlements, racial segregation and apartheid system in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank to be unlawful. The court said that states must cooperate to ensure an end to Israel\u2019s illegal presence in the occupied Palestinian territory and must not render aid or assistance in maintaining the unlawful situation created by Israel. The Israeli foreign ministry rejected the ruling as \u201cfundamentally wrong\u201d and one-sided. \u201cPalestinians appreciate the diplomatic and rhetorical support of states such as Brazil, Russia, Nigeria, Kazakhstan, among others. However, this cannot exonerate their direct complicity in literally fueling Israel\u2019s genocide and underlying system of settler-colonial apartheid,\u201d said Omar Barghouti, co-founder of the boycott, divestment, sanctions (BDS) movement, which is calling for an energy embargo on Israel. The governments of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Nigeria, Gabon and the Republic of the Congo did not respond to requests for comment, and neither did Greece or Albania. *** Corporate interests Corporations can and have been held liable for providing material support in war crimes during previous conflicts. In the Nuremberg trials, corporate officials were held directly responsible for their material assistance to crimes committed by the Nazi regime. In a recent landmark civil ruling, Chiquita was ordered to pay $38m to the families of Colombian men murdered by a paramilitary group financed by the US fruit company between 1997 and 2004. The UN has guiding principles for businesses and other non-state actors on their obligations to respect human rights and abide by international humanitarian law and international criminal law, over and above compliance with national laws. \u201cCorporations supplying jet fuel and oil to Israel may be providing material support to the military, aware of its foreseeable harmful effects, and therefore risk complicity in war crimes, genocide and other crimes under international law,\u201d said Dr Irene Pietropaoli, senior fellow in business and human rights at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. Just six major international fossil-fuel companies \u2013 BP, Chevron, Eni, ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalEnergies \u2013 could be linked to 35% of the crude oil supplied to Israel since October, the OCI analysis suggests. This is based on direct stakes in oilfields supplying Israeli and/or the companies\u2019 shares in production nationally. \u201cGiven the well-documented ongoing war crimes and warnings of a genocide, these oil corporations have the responsibility to identify and prevent any contribution to violations by the Israeli army,\u201d said Lydia de Leeuw, researcher and co-author of Fuelling the Flames in Gaza at the Dutch non-profit Somo. Shell and Total declined to comment. BP and Exxon did not respond. A spokesperson for Chevron, which owns stakes in oil production in Kazakhstan, Nigeria and the Congo, said the company was focused on reliably providing energy the world needs: \u201cChevron operates in compliance with all applicable laws.\u201d Eni, which owns a 61% stake in the Italian oilfield which supplied a 30KT shipment delivered to Israel last month, said: \u201cRegardless of the accuracy of the data reported, which we do not intend to comment on, Eni firmly rejects the very serious accusations \u2026 [associating] Eni\u2019s activities with the ongoing war events in Gaza, especially through predominantly indirect connections such as participation in upstream or midstream projects.\u201d Eni added: \u201cIn general, oil supplies primarily support the functioning of social, economic, and industrial systems in countries.\u201d In February, dozens of UN experts called on states to consider \u201csanctions on trade, finance, travel, technology and cooperation\u201d as part of measures to prevent and stop violations of international humanitarian law by Israel, after it failed to comply with the ICJ ruling. Last week, Colombia suspended coal exports to Israel \u201cto prevent and stop acts of genocide against the Palestinian people\u201d, according to the decree signed by President Gustavo Petro. Petro wrote on X: \u201cWith Colombian coal they make bombs to kill the children of Palestine.\u201d Historically, energy embargoes have been used as collective counter-measures to pressure states committing grave violations of international law, including against the apartheid regime in South Africa. David Tong, industry campaign manager at Oil Change International, said: \u201cEvery day that oil companies provide fuel to Israel these companies expose themselves to potential legal action for their complicity in genocidal acts against civilians in Gaza.\u201d Albanese said: \u201cI have recommended that weapons and oil to Israel be suspended until the current assault in Gaza stops. Like all sanctions, this may come at a cost, but that is the deterrent function that sanctions should also serve.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-02T00:18:54Z",
            "content": "The Ukrainian first lady, Olena Zelenska, has attended in Turkey the launch of the Hetman Ivan Vyhovskyi, an anti-submarine warship newly built for Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s defence minister, Rustem Umerov, said: \u201cCorvettes Hetman Ivan Vyhovskyi and [previously launched] Hetman Ivan Mazepa, which were built in Turkey due to Russian aggression, are equipped with cutting-edge weapons and will become a significant addition to our fleet \u2026 Ukraine has already broken the dominance of the Russian fleet at sea, destroying dozens of ships. We are actively expanding the capabilities of the Ukrainian navy in the Black and Azov seas.\u201d It is unclear when either warship will be able to reach Ukraine, because the Montreux convention generally prohibits warring parties\u2019 battleships from entering or exiting the Black Sea via the Bosphorus, which Turkey controls. Russian-occupied Crimea came under attack from missiles and drones on Friday morning, according to reports. The Russian-installed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said debris fell on the city. Explosions were heard in Saki where there is an airbase and in Yevpatoria, according to news sources including Crimean Wind, a Telegram channel that reliably reports on military activities on the peninsula. Kursk oblast inside Russia also came under air attack, said the governor, Alexey Smirnov. A mother and her daughter were killed by Russian shelling of Nikopol in the Dnipropetrovsk region of Ukraine\u2019s east, its governor said on Thursday. \u201cThey hit the city with a dozen shells,\u201d said Serhiy Lysak, adding that private houses, a fire station, a college, a school and buses were damaged. The F-16 fighter jets that have started arriving in Ukraine will likely have three core missions, according to analyst Federico Borsari of the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington. They will seek to intercept Russian missiles and drones; suppress Russian air defences; and bomb Russian troops and ammunition depots. \u201cThey will be able to affect some of the dynamics [of the war],\u201d Borsari says. In the air, the Ukrainian F-16s will be up against Russia\u2019s formidable S-300 and S-400 mobile surface-to-air missile systems that can target multiple aircraft at a time. Russia\u2019s military also has what are estimated to be several hundred operational fighter jets, as well as sophisticated air surveillance radars. A Shahed drone attack near Kyiv injured exiled Russian lawmaker Ilya Ponomaryov, he said on Thursday. Ponomaryov, 48, fled to Ukraine and gained citizenship after opposing Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea. \u201cThis thing blew in very forcefully, right in front of the threshold of the house, and loads of shrapnel flew into me,\u201d Ponomaryov said. Until this week Ponomaryov headed the political wing of the Freedom of Russia Legion \u2013 ethnic Russians fighting on Ukraine\u2019s side. It announced on Wednesday that it had unilaterally cut ties with Ponomaryov and no longer had a political wing. The Estonian government said on Thursday it would introduce full customs controls on its border with Russia to combat circumvention of sanctions. \u201cThe goods that allow [Russia] to wage war against Ukraine, undermine Europe\u2019s and Estonia\u2019s security shouldn\u2019t be imported there,\u201d said the Estonian prime minister, Kristen Michal. The finance minister, Jurgen Ligi, said: \u201cThird countries are declared as [a] destination point, but we don\u2019t believe it. And life has shown that these goods don\u2019t reach the destination. This cargo includes really ugly things, both military and dual-use goods, large amounts of cash. It\u2019s obvious that these are being smuggled through us.\u201d The Ukrainian economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, arrived in Turkey on Thursday for talks on ratifying their free trade agreement and other economic cooperation. Turkey is among Ukraine\u2019s top five trading partners and the agreement will cancel duties on a significant number of Ukrainian goods. The date of the ratification has not yet been determined by the Ukrainian parliament."

            "date": "2024-08-08T07:33:09Z",
            "content": "The bargain bins of the upmarket grocery in the Achrafieh area of eastern Beirut are filled with offers that are unusual for its high-end clientele. On sale: 40 rolls of toilet paper, 6-litre jugs of water, 10kg bags of powdered detergent, 5kg of sugar. Shoppers are ignoring the French cheese and heading straight to the canned goods. Their carts are stuffed with nappies, cartons of UHT milk and dried beans. \u201cWe\u2019re getting the food that will last the longest. We have no idea what the coming days will bring,\u201d Charbel Kiwan, a fruit and vegetable supplier, said while shopping with his wife and their two children. The family had been resolved in the morning to go shopping, but rushed to the store after Israeli jets broke the sound barrier three times in a row on Tuesday afternoon, rattling windowpanes across the Lebanese capital. As warplanes boomed across the city, the head of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, was giving a speech, vowing revenge against Israel. Both the Lebanese militant group and Iran have said a \u201cstrong\u201d retaliation against Israel is imminent, blaming Israel for last month\u2019s killing in Beirut of Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah\u2019s most senior military commander, and the assassination in Tehran of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas. How and when that retaliation will come remains unclear, with US officials twice revising their predictions of an Iranian response. As diplomats scrambled to defuse the conflict, Nasrallah said on Tuesday: \u201cIsrael\u2019s week-long wait is part of the punishment and retaliation.\u201d The anticipation is also weighing on the Lebanese people, who, despite 10 months of brinkmanship after Hezbollah\u2019s opening of the northern front with Israel, feel that this time a full-scale conflict is possible. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that a war will happen, but this is the first time it seems so dangerous,\u201d Kiwan said, his cart full of canned vegetables and bags of rice. \u201cInside we feel \u2026 Well, it\u2019s been hard,\u201d his wife added, letting out a long sigh. Mental health experts have said the looming prospect of war has contributed to a \u201ccontinuous anxiety\u201d in Lebanon that is having long-term effects on people and their ability to plan for the future. \u201cWe\u2019re receiving frequent calls from individuals who are worried about the potential of a full-scale war in Lebanon,\u201d said Mia Atwi, a clinical psychologist and president of the Lebanese mental health hotline Embrace. Atwi added that people often ignore their long-term mental health in times of crisis, instead focusing on securing their basic needs such as shelter, food and safety. Lebanese officials have said there is no need to panic or to hoard goods. Informed by the experience of the 2006 war with Israel, fuel and medicine importers have been making contingency plans in the case of another conflict. \u201cAs far as the food supply is concerned, there is absolutely no problem. We have a two-to-three-month supply of goods, which is a reasonable benchmark,\u201d said Hani Bohsali, the head of Lebanon\u2019s Syndicate of Food Importers. Similarly, the head of the syndicate for petrol station operators confirmed to the Guardian that there was at least a month\u2019s worth of fuel stock in the country. While food and fuel storage depots may be at full capacity, distribution could be a challenge if a war breaks out. In 2006, Israel bombed highways, bridges and other civilian infrastructure, making transport of supplies from storage facilities to market impossible. \u201cIn 2006, Israelis were hitting transportation trucks because they could be potentially carrying arms. I had a warehouse with thousands of tons of food, but I wasn\u2019t able to distribute it,\u201d Bohsali said. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no shortage right now, but whether or not we can distribute it or not, that\u2019s impossible to predict.\u201d Official calls for calm holds little sway because of widespread distrust of the government, which is generally viewed as corrupt and incompetent. Messages are forwarded across WhatsApp groups urging people to start fuelling their cars, sparked by an alarming piece of news or the flurry of rumours swirling around social media. Not everyone in Lebanon can afford to plan for a disaster. The country is still deep in a five-year-long economic crisis during which the national currency has lost 95% of its value. \u201cPrepare? There\u2019s no money,\u201d a immigrant worker said while shopping, asking to remain anonymous. \u201cI wanted to buy a big bag of rice, but it\u2019s too expensive,\u201d they added, gesturing to their shopping basket that held a single bundle of bread and a small bag of basmati rice."

            "content": "Russia\u2019s defence ministry said about 300 soldiers from Ukraine backed by tanks and armoured vehicles launched a cross-border attack into the Kursk region on Tuesday, while fighting was reported as deep as six miles (10km) inside Russia, Dan Sabbagh writes. Fighting took place between the border villages of Nikolayevo-Daryino and Oleshnya, and as far inside Russia as the fringes of Sudzha. Two strikes on Russian trailers loaded with tanks were photographed from overhead, according to reports on social media which the Guardian could not verify. Ukraine\u2019s political leaders and defence ministry did not immediately comment on the situation, but one junior official acknowledged the attack was taking place and indicated it had not been defeated. Andrii Kovalenko from Ukraine\u2019s national security and defence council said: \u201cRussian soldiers are lying about the controllability of the situation in the Kursk region. Russia does not control the border.\u201d There have been previous raids into Russia by pro-Ukrainian groups of Russians such as the Russian Volunteer Corps and Freedom of Russia Legion. Ukraine is putting more funding towards its domestic missile programme, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president, said on Tuesday. Ukraine needs to compensate for western allies not letting it use the missiles they supply for long-range strikes on bases inside Russian territory. Ukraine is trying to build up its domestic output of, for example, the Neptune, a Ukrainian anti-ship missile that can also attack land targets. At least one person was killed and 12 others including an eight-month-old baby were injured when a Russian Iskander ballistic missile struck a residential area of Kharkiv in north-east Ukraine, Ukrainian officials said. A medical clinic was among many buildings damaged, said the regional governor, Oleh Syniehubov. Maria Andreyeva, a leading Russian anti-mobilisation activist, has said she quit her campaigning after coming under pressure from the Kremlin. Putin\u2019s regime has clamped down on a group of wives and mothers known as \u201cPut Domoy\u201d (Way Home) publicly calling on the Russian president to bring forcibly mobilised men back from the frontlines in Ukraine.

In Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region, Russian forces have advanced near Toretsk: in Pivnichne to its east, and to its south in Niu York where they raised a flag on a building, said the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). In an unconfirmed development, Russia\u2019s defence ministry said its units had \u201cliberated the settlement of Timofeevka\u201d, whose Ukrainian name is Timofiyivka, as the head of Russia\u2019s general staff, Valery Gerasimov, reportedly visited troop positions in occupied parts of Donetsk. The ISW said Sergei Shoigu, Russia\u2019s security council secretary and former defence minister, had \u201cheavily overexaggerated\u201d Russian advances in Ukraine since mid-June 2024, claiming 420 sq km. \u201cISW has observed evidence confirming that Russian forces have seized approximately 290 square kilometres since June 14.\u201d said the US-based thinktank.

            "title": "New round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations begins without Hamas",
            "date": "2024-08-15T17:59:58Z",
            "content": "A new round of negotiations aimed at brokering a ceasefire in the war in Gaza and preventing the fighting from escalating into a region-wide conflict got under way in Doha, as the death toll in the Palestinian territory reached a grim milestone of 40,000 people, according to local health authorities. Mediators from the US, Qatar and Egypt met an Israeli delegation in the Qatari capital on Thursday afternoon, with talks expected to continue into the next day. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, is not directly participating in the talks, meaning expectations of a breakthrough are low. While Hamas and Israel agreed in principle last month to implement a three-phase plan publicly proposed by Joe Biden in May, both sides have since requested \u201camendments\u201d and \u201cclarifications\u201d, leaving talks at an impasse. Gaps include the continuing presence of Israeli troops on the Gaza-Egypt border, the sequencing of a hostage release, and the return of civilians from southern to northern Gaza. The renewed push for talks is seen as more vital than ever after the 31 July back-to-back assassinations of a top Hezbollah commander and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas\u2019s political chief. The killings in Beirut and Tehran, which the Lebanese group and Iran have blamed on Israel, threaten to transform the war in Gaza into a region-wide conflict. It is hoped that a ceasefire in Gaza would lower the temperature in the Middle East and dissuade Iran and Hezbollah from retaliatory action. In an interview with CNN on Thursday, the White House\u2019s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said talks had begun with a \u201cpromising start\u201d, but an immediate agreement is unlikely given the large gaps that remain between the two sides. He added that the US assessed that Tehran is still determined to respond to Haniyeh\u2019s killing with an attack on Israel. Over the past two weeks, the US has deployed warships, submarines and warplanes to the region to defend Israel from potential attacks from Iran and its network of allied militias in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, all of whom have already been drawn into the Gaza war. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been accused of sabotaging the talks for political gain, but reportedly expanded the negotiating team\u2019s mandate before it flew to Doha on Thursday morning. In a statement on the eve of the talks, Hamas reaffirmed its demands, including that negotiations should focus on implementing the Biden plan rather than allowing Israel to \u201cstall for time\u201d. Late on Thursday, a US official said the first day of talk had been \u201cconstructive\u201d, while a spokesperson for Qatar\u2019s foreign ministry confirmed that discusstions would continued into Friday. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, who is reportedly planning an imminent trip to Israel, said in a statement: \u201cWe are at a crucial moment for global stability. The coming hours and days could define the future of the Middle East \u2026 A ceasefire would not only protect civilians in Gaza, but also pave the way for wider de-escalation and bring much-needed stability. \u201cIt is in the interests of both Israelis and Palestinians for a deal to be agreed, urgently. I urge all parties to engage in the negotiations in good faith and show the flexibility needed to reach an agreement.\u201d As talks were under way in Doha, the Israeli army continued its latest ground operation in Gaza\u2019s southern city of Khan Younis, with local people reporting artillery and aerial attacks, as well as bombings in Rafah. Israeli airstrikes killed 40 people in the strip in the last 24 hours, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said, pushing the death toll to 40,005 in 10 months of fighting. The local authorities do not differentiate between civilian and militant casualties, but 70% are believed to be women and children. The figure represents almost 2% of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million population, making the Gaza war one of the deadliest of the 21st century to date and by far the bloodiest in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. About 10,000 more people are believed to still be under the rubble, and those who have died from illness, starvation and other hardships caused by the war are not counted in official tolls. Israel disputes the Gaza toll, but in multiple wars in the blockaded territory over the 17 years since Hamas took over, the UN has found that the local health authority figures are accurate. Tarneem Hammad, the central Gaza-based advocacy officer for the UK charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, said: \u201cForty thousand lives lost in Gaza \u2013 a devastating reminder that behind each number is a story, a family, a future stolen. Let the magnitude not numb us, but rather ignite our resolve to seek justice and peace, and to demand a ceasefire. No more lives should be lost.\u201d Abu Nidal Eweini, a resident of the central town of Deir al-Balah, told the AP: \u201cOh Lord, we hope they reach an agreement and the war ends, because the population has been annihilated completely. People have no breath left in them any more. People are tired.\u201d Also on Thursday, during an address to the Turkish parliament in Ankara, the head of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, vowed to visit the Gaza Strip. Abbas\u2019s secular Fatah party was exiled from Gaza after a brief civil war with Hamas in 2007, after which the Islamist group took control of the coastal territory. Elected to a five-year term in 2005, the deeply unpopular leader has repeatedly refused to hold elections since. It was not immediately clear how Abbas, 88, would fulfil his pledge, as Israel controls all of Gaza\u2019s border crossings. Hamas triggered the war in Gaza with its 7 October attack on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 taken hostage. On Thursday, family and friends of the remaining estimated 115 Israelis still in captivity in Gaza protested in favour of a deal outside the Tel Aviv headquarters of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party."

            "date": "2024-08-19T18:32:14Z",
            "content": "The US secretary of state has said during a visit to Israel that the current round of ceasefire talks is \u201cmaybe the last opportunity\u201d to broker a truce and a hostage and prisoner swap in the 10-month-old war in Gaza. Antony Blinken met Israeli officials, including in a three-hour one-on-one with the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Monday during a 24-hour trip to Tel Aviv before he travels on to Egypt. The US diplomat\u2019s trip \u2013 his ninth since the war broke out \u2013 is part of renewed international efforts to broker a ceasefire after the recent assassinations of a top Hezbollah commander and Hamas\u2019s political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, in Lebanon and Iran. After the meeting, Blinken told reporters that Netanyahu \u201csupports\u201d the ceasefire proposal, according to the Associated Press. \u201cIn a very constructive meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu today, he confirmed to me that Israel supports the bridging [ceasefire] proposal,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cThe next important step is for Hamas to say yes.\u201d US officials have been accused of being too optimistic in their regular claims that negotiators were on the verge of striking a deal. But on Monday Netanyahu\u2019s office also put out a rare public statement backing the US bridging proposal. \u201cThe prime minister reiterated Israel\u2019s commitment to the current American proposal on the release of our hostages, which takes into account Israel\u2019s security needs, which he strongly insists on,\u201d the statement read. A spokesperson for Netanyahu confirmed that the prime minister had told Blinken that Israel had agreed to the bridging proposal, the New York Times reported. The killings of Haniyeh and the Hezbollah commander had set the Middle East on edge, and a cessation of hostilities in Gaza has been seen as the best way to cool the regional tensions. Tehran and the powerful Lebanese militia have threatened retaliatory action. \u201cThis is a decisive moment, probably the best, maybe the last, opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security,\u201d Blinken said before a meeting with Israel\u2019s president, Isaac Herzog. \u201cIt\u2019s also time to make sure that no one takes any steps that could derail this process,\u201d he said in a veiled reference to Iran. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re working to make sure that there is no escalation, that there are no provocations, that there are no actions that in any way move us away from getting this deal over the line, or for that matter, escalate the conflict to other places and to greater intensity.\u201d The latest negotiations began in Doha last week and are expected to resume in Cairo on Wednesday or Thursday, but optimism from international mediators at the close of two days of Qatar negotiations has not been matched by Israel or Hamas. In its first official comments since the new round of talks began, Hamas said on Sunday night that the latest proposal on the table was a capitulation to Israel that \u201cresponds to Netanyahu\u2019s conditions\u201d, negating the possibility of future talks. Hamas is not directly participating in the latest round and is instead being briefed on developments by the mediators Qatar and Egypt. Israel, too, has expressed an unwillingness to compromise on points such as the withdrawal of troops from the Gaza-Egypt border. Netanyahu said at the start of his weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday: \u201cThere are things we can be flexible on and there are things that we cannot be flexible on, which we will insist on.\u201d The plan would involve an initial six-week ceasefire during which a limited number of Israeli hostages would be freed in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails, and the amount of humanitarian aid entering the strip would increase. Unlike the week-long truce that collapsed at the end of November, this ceasefire would be indefinitely extendable while negotiators work on the next stage, which would involve another round of hostage and prisoner swaps and a drawdown of Israeli troops. There have been reports of friction between Netanyahu and his negotiating team over the future of the Gaza-Egypt border zone, known in Israel as the Philadelphi corridor. The Israeli news website Ynet reported on Monday that the prime minister had refused to countenance giving up control of the area, although members of the security establishment, including his defence minister, Yoav Gallant, believed a compromise could be reached with the use of surveillance technology. Netanyahu\u2019s critics have repeatedly accused him of stalling on implementing a deal in order to appease his rightwing allies, who have threatened to collapse his government. The longtime Israeli leader sees staying in office as the best way of avoiding a conviction for corruption charges, which he denies. An Israeli delegation travelled to Egypt on Sunday to discuss the possibility of a withdrawal mechanism from Rafah, but no progress was made on the issue and the delegation did not offer anything new, an Egyptian official told Agence France-Presse. Hours after Blinken landed in Tel Aviv there was a small explosion in the city in which one person was killed and another injured. It was later claimed as a suicide bombing by the armed wings of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Hamas had stopped using the tactic in 2005. The groups threatened to carry out more such attacks in Israel \u201cas long as the occupation\u2019s massacres, the displacement of civilians and the policy of assassinations continue\u201d. Despite Blinken\u2019s plea that \u201cno one takes any steps that could derail\u201d the ceasefire talks, violence continued to rage in Gaza and on the Israel-Lebanon border on Monday. An Israeli soldier and two Hezbollah fighters were killed in cross-border clashes, the Israeli military and the Lebanese militant group confirmed. On Monday night the Israeli army said it had hit \u201ca number of Hezbollah weapons storage facilities\u201d in Lebanon\u2019s eastern Bekaa Valley. At least three Israeli airstrikes hit towns in the Baalbek district, Lebanese state media reported. Videos from the scene showed a large fire and multiple explosions after the initial strike, the Associated Press reported. The Israeli army said that \u201cfollowing the strikes, secondary explosions were identified, indicating the presence of large amounts of weapons in the facilities struck\u201d. In Gaza, three people were reported killed in an Israeli airstrike in the southern village of Abassan, and airstrikes in Khan Younis killed a baby and injured several women, medics in the Hamas-dominated territory said. The Israeli military said it had struck \u201c45 terrorist targets\u201d in the past 24 hours and ground forces were operating in the Khan Younis area. About 170,000 people have been displaced in the past week after the Israeli army issued new evacuation orders across southern Gaza, including for some areas previously designated as humanitarian safe zones. According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the UN\u2019s humanitarian agency, just 11% of Gaza\u2019s total area is now deemed \u201csafe\u201d, although Israel has also bombed the humanitarian zones on several occasions. Almost all of the strip\u2019s 2.3 million population have been displaced from their homes and 40,000 people have been killed amid a devastating humanitarian crisis, according to the local health authority. About 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage in Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack on southern Israel that triggered the war."

            "date": "2024-08-22T17:11:44Z",
            "content": "US officials have expressed optimism that a ceasefire deal in the war in Gaza \u201cis in sight\u201d, despite growing indications from Israel and Hamas that a breakthrough is not imminent and as renewed fighting rages in parts of the Palestinian territory. Washington has put pressure on both parties to accept a bridging proposal suggested during internationally mediated talks in Qatar last week, dispatching the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on his ninth visit to the region since the conflict broke out 10 months ago. The latest round of negotiations, in which Hamas is not directly participating, were scheduled to restart in Cairo by Thursday but appear to have been postponed. Hamas has said the latest proposal veers too closely to Israel\u2019s demands, but characterised comments by the US president, Joe Biden, on Tuesday that it was backing away from an agreement as \u201cmisleading\u201d. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has reportedly refused to countenance an Israeli withdrawal from the Netzarim corridor that now bisects the Gaza Strip, or the Egypt-Gaza border \u2013 a red line for Hamas and for Cairo. Israel\u2019s Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper quoted \u201cofficials knowledgable about the negotiations\u201d as saying \u201cthe chances for a deal are slim\u201d but attempts were being made to hold talks in Cairo on Friday and Saturday. It said, quoting the same source, that Netanyahu insisted on an Israeli army \u201cpresence along the Philadelphi corridor\u201d on the Gaza Strip\u2019s border with Egypt and that the US \u201cdemanded a significant withdrawal of troops\u201d in two stages. The paper said \u201cthe Americans understood the mistake\u201d made by Blinken when he announced during his visit to Israel that Netanyahu had accepted a US proposal to bring the two sides closer together and that \u201cthe ball was now in Hamas\u2019s court\u201d. Yet Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, told the security council on Thursday that an agreement was \u201cnow is in sight\u201d, after a phone call late on Wednesday in which Biden pressed Netanyahu on agreeing to a deal. In the call between the leaders, in which the vice-president and presumptive Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, also took part, the US leader stressed to his Israeli counterpart \u201cthe urgency of bringing the ceasefire and hostage release deal to closure and discussed upcoming talks in Cairo to remove any remaining obstacles\u201d, a White House statement said. The renewed push for talks is seen as more vital than ever after the 31 July back-to-back assassinations of a top Hezbollah commander and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas\u2019s political chief. The killings in Beirut and Tehran, which the Lebanese group and Iran have blamed on Israel, threaten to transform the war in Gaza into a region-wide conflict. It is hoped a ceasefire in Gaza would lower the temperature in the Middle East and dissuade Iran and Hezbollah from retaliatory action. Israel and the powerful Lebanese militia have traded intense rocket fire over the past two days and tensions on the \u201cblue line\u201d that separates Israel and Lebanon have steadily escalated since Hezbollah began firing on Israel in solidarity with Hamas a day after the 7 October attack that triggered the war. On the ground, Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said at least three people were killed and 10 children wounded in an Israeli strike on Wednesday on a school turned shelter in Gaza City, and 22 people were killed in the past 24 hours. The Israeli military said the school contained a weapons storage facility. Israeli troops and tanks are also pressing deeper into areas of the central and southern Gaza Strip as they battle Hamas fighters who have regrouped. Approximately 170,000 displaced people have been forced to flee once again due to the new Israeli operations, including from areas previously designated as humanitarian \u201csafe zones\u201d. Aid agencies say the remaining humanitarian zones, which comprise just 11% of the strip\u2019s total area, are already too full to accommodate new arrivals. Violence has escalated in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where the health ministry said three people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house in the Tulkarm refugee camp in the early hours of Thursday. The Israeli army said the strike was a counter-terrorism operation."

            "date": "2024-08-18T22:36:04Z",
            "content": "The US secretary of state has arrived in Israel for 11th-hour talks aimed at shoring up a deal for a lasting ceasefire in the war in Gaza, amid signals from Israeli and Hamas officials that a breakthrough may not be as close as international mediators had suggested. Antony Blinken flew into Tel Aviv on Sunday as part of Washington\u2019s renewed efforts to broker a ceasefire in the 10-month-old conflict, negotiations seen as even more urgent after last month\u2019s back-to-back assassinations of a top Hezbollah commander and the Hamas political chief, Ismail Haniyeh. It is hoped a ceasefire would lower the temperature in the Middle East and dissuade Iran and Hezbollah from retaliatory action that could cause the war in Gaza to slide quickly into a region-wide conflict. The US\u2019s top diplomat will seek to \u201cconclude the agreement for a ceasefire and release of hostages and detainees\u201d during his ninth visit to the region since the war broke out following Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack, the state department said. Blinken is expected to meet senior leaders including Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Monday before travelling on to Egypt. International mediators the US, Qatar and Egypt struck an optimistic tone after two days of talks in the Qatari capital, Doha, last week, announcing that a \u201cbridging proposal\u201d had been agreed. Negotiations to close remaining gaps are expected to resume in Cairo on Wednesday or Thursday. The US is keen to be able to announce that a deal has been agreed during the Cairo summit, as focus in Washington begins to turn to November\u2019s US elections. However, Hamas, which is not directly participating in this round of negotiations, has said the idea that a deal is getting closer is \u201can illusion\u201d. On Sunday evening Hamas said the new proposal was too aligned with the Israeli prime minister\u2019s position. \u201cWe hold Netanyahu fully responsible for thwarting the mediators\u2019 efforts, delaying the agreement, and for the lives of his prisoners who are exposed to the same danger as our people due to his ongoing aggression and systematic targeting of all aspects of life in the Gaza Strip,\u201d it said. But Netanyahu said it was Hamas that must be pressured. \u201cHamas, up to this moment, remains obstinate. It did not even send a representative to the talks in Doha. Therefore, the pressure should be directed at Hamas and [Yahya] Sinwar, not at the Israeli government,\u201d Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting on Sunday, referring to the Hamas chief. Israeli officials have also expressed caution. \u201cAfter the United States accepted most of [Israel\u2019s] demands, we have to be flexible on the clarifications that were added,\u201d an unnamed source with knowledge of the talks told Israel\u2019s Channel 12. \u201cOtherwise, there isn\u2019t any chance of bringing Hamas to the table \u2026 from its perspective, this is an American-Israeli proposal.\u201d Netanyahu said at the start of his weekly cabinet meeting: \u201cI would like to emphasise we are conducting negotiations and not a scenario in which we just give and give. There are things we can be flexible on and there are things that we cannot be flexible on, which we will insist on. \u201cTherefore, alongside the major efforts we are making to return our hostages, we stand on the principles that we have determined, which are vital for the security of Israel.\u201d Hamas and Israel agreed in principle last month to implement a three-phase framework publicly proposed by Biden in May and endorsed by the UN security council. The plan would involve an initial six-week ceasefire, during which a limited number of Israeli hostages would be freed in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails, and the amount of humanitarian aid entering the strip would increase. Unlike the week-long truce that collapsed at the end of November, this ceasefire would be indefinitely extendable while negotiators thrash out details of the next stage, so an impasse would not necessarily trigger a return to hostilities. Hamas has said the latest version of the proposal under discussion diverges significantly from the May iteration after new Israeli demands were added, including a permanent Israeli military presence along the Gaza-Egypt border and the Netzarim corridor, the new Israeli-controlled barrier bisecting the strip. Israel says those measures are necessary to stop Hamas and other militias rearming and regrouping, while Hamas has reiterated its core demand that all Israeli troops must completely withdraw from Gaza as a prelude to ending the war. To date, Israel has not been willing to agree to go beyond a temporary pause in the fighting. Critics at home and abroad have accused Netanyahu of stalling on a deal for political gain, but Israeli media reported that the prime minister was scheduled to meet his negotiating team on Sunday to review whether an Israeli presence in the two areas was non-negotiable. According to Egyptian officials who spoke to the Associated Press, Egyptian and Israeli military officials are expected to meet next week to discuss the possibility of a withdrawal mechanism from Rafah, on the Gaza-Egypt border. The Rafah crossing is the strip\u2019s main lifeline to the rest of the world; humanitarian groups have complained of backlogs and distribution issues since Israel seized control of the area in May. Last week the Palestinian health authority confirmed the first case of polio in the strip for 25 years. Even amid speculation over a ceasefire, the bloodshed in Gaza continues: Israeli strikes across the besieged territory killed 28 people overnight and into Sunday, according to first responders, including a woman and her six children in the central town of Deir al-Balah. Mohammed Awad Khatab, the children\u2019s grandfather, said his daughter was a teacher and her youngest child was 18 months old. The others were 10-year-old quintuplets, al-Aqsa hospital said. \u201cThe six children have become body parts. They were placed in a single bag,\u201d he told reporters at the hospital. \u201cWhat did they do? Did they kill any of the Jews? \u2026 Will this provide security to Israel?\u201d On Sunday evening, one person was killed after a bomb exploded in Tel Aviv, according to Israeli police. \u201cIt has been confirmed as a bomb explosion,\u201d a police spokesperson said. \u201cAs a result of the explosion, one person \u2013 whose identity is still unknown \u2013 was killed, and another person was moderately injured. All investigative avenues are being explored.\u201d Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have also flared after an Israeli strike on southern Lebanon on Saturday that killed 10 people, one of the deadliest single attacks on Lebanon since Hezbollah and Israel started trading crossborder fire on 8 October. Hezbollah and Iran\u2019s other allies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have said they will stop attacking Israel when the war in Gaza is brought to an end. The long-running shadow war between Israel and Iran burst into the open for the first time in April when Tehran launched more than 300 ballistic missiles and drones at Israel in revenge for the killing of several Iranian Revolutionary Guards commanders in Damascus. That attack was heavily telegraphed in advance, allowing Israel\u2019s air defence systems and the air forces of several of its allies to intercept most of the projectiles. About 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas invasion on 7 October, and another 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s retaliatory war in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run strip, and almost all of the 2.3 million population have been displaced from their homes amid a dire humanitarian crisis."

            "date": "2024-08-16T21:24:25Z",
            "content": "The latest round of Gaza ceasefire talks have ended in Doha without a breakthrough, but a new date next week has been set for further negotiations to attempt to end the 10-month-old war. A White House statement signed by the co-mediators Qatar and Egypt described a fresh proposal that built \u201con areas of agreement\u201d and bridged remaining gaps in a manner that allowed for \u201ca swift implementation of the deal\u201d. In another statement late on Friday, Joe Biden said the \u201cbridging proposal\u201d offered the basis for a final agreement on a ceasefire and hostage release deal, adding: \u201cWith the comprehensive ceasefire and hostage release deal now in sight, no one in the region should take actions to undermine this process.\u201d Though the two statements struck an optimistic tone, dozens of rounds of indirect talks between Hamas and Israel have failed to achieve a deal since a short-lived truce collapsed in December. The hopeful language may also be aimed at further stalling Iranian retaliation against Israel after the assassination of the Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran last month. There are widespread concerns that an attack on Israel by Iran could spark an intense regional conflict. The US president, Joe Biden, said: \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet,\u201d but added that a Gaza ceasefire deal was \u201ccloser than three days ago\u201d. However, a Hamas spokesperson accused Washington of trying to create a \u201cfalse atmosphere\u201d without any genuine intention of stopping the war. The new push for an end to conflict came as the Palestinian death toll in Gaza climbed past 40,000, according to local health authorities. Diplomatic pressure has mounted on Israel to make concessions when talks resume in Cairo next week. Speaking in Tel Aviv on Friday after a meeting with his Israeli counterpart, Israel Katz, David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, said Israeli officials told him they were hoping they were on the verge of reaching a deal. \u201cThe time for a deal for those hostages to be returned, for aid to get in in the quantities that are necessary in Gaza and for the fighting to stop is now,\u201d Lammy said. Speaking alongside him, the French foreign minister, St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, said this was a key moment \u201cbecause it could lead to peace or war\u201d. Katz said in a statement that Israel expected its allies not just to help it defend itself against an Iranian attack, but to join in attacking Iran afterwards. The death of Haniyeh came hours after an Israeli strike killed Fuad Shukr, a top military commander in Lebanon\u2019s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, which has exchanged near-daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces. Hezbollah has promised to avenge the killing of Shukr and, in a clear message to Israel, on Friday released a video, with Hebrew and English subtitles, that appeared to show underground tunnels where trucks were transporting long-range missiles. Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza continued on Friday. Israeli forces issued evacuation orders to people in southern and central areas previously designated as \u201chumanitarian safe zones\u201d, saying Hamas had used the areas to fire mortars and rockets at Israel. Israel said warning flyers and text messages had been sent out in the eastern part of Deir al-Balah and another area north of the city of Khan Younis, where tens of thousands of people have sought shelter from fighting in other parts of Gaza. \u201cThe advance warning to civilians is being issued in order to mitigate harm to the civilian population and to enable civilians to move away from the combat zone,\u201d the military said in a statement. Aya, 28, said she had \u201cfelt fear, shock and confusion\u201d after learning of the evacuation orders, but decided to flee Deir al-Balah when she heard the sounds of bombing close by. \u201cThings deteriorated quickly after rumours began to spread about the approach of tanks. Everyone started screaming from panic and we ended up escaping with our children, leaving our tent and most of our belongings behind,\u201d she said. Any sustained assault on Deir al-Balah could force tens of thousands of people to flee again to other parts of the devastated territory. Commenting on the new evacuation order, Unrwa, the main UN agency in Gaza, said that people remained \u201ctrapped in an endless nightmare of death and destruction on a staggering scale\u201d. Expectations were low for this round of ceasefire talks, which began on Thursday. Hamas, which did not participate directly in the talks, has accused Israel of adding new demands to a previous proposal that had US and international support and to which the militant Islamist organisation had agreed in principle. Both sides have agreed in principle to the plan Biden announced on 31 May, but Hamas has proposed amendments and Israel has suggested clarifications, leading each side to accuse the other of trying to undermine chances of a deal. Hamas has rejected many of Israel\u2019s demands, which include a lasting military presence along the border with Egypt and a line bisecting Gaza, where Israeli forces would search Palestinians returning to their homes to root out militants. Hamas has nonetheless said it is committed to the talks. There are also disagreements over the sequencing of any ceasefire, whether it would mark a definitive end of hostilities and how many Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails in return for about 110 remaining hostages seized by Hamas in its shock raid into Israel in October last year. Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in that attack. Additional reporting by Malak A Tantesh in Gaza"

            "content": "The head of Israel\u2019s security agency, Shin Bet, has warned the country\u2019s leaders that Jewish terrorism in the West Bank is out of control and has become a serious threat to national security. Ronen Bar issued the warning in a letter to the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the attorney general and members of the Israeli cabinet, some of whom are outspoken backers of the extremist settlers responsible for the escalating violence. Bar\u2019s letter, sent last week but published by Israel\u2019s Channel 12 News on Thursday night, has highlighted the wide, acrimonious gap between the far-right wing of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition and Israel\u2019s security apparatus. The national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, one of those criticised by Bar for inflammatory behaviour, called for the Shin Bet head to be fired, triggering a rebuke on Friday from the defence minister, Yoav Gallant. Bar\u2019s letter focused on Jewish extremists known as the \u201chilltop youth\u201d, violent militants who have been conducting a campaign of murder, arson and intimidation against Palestinians on the West Bank, aimed at driving them from their land, furthering the far right\u2019s pursuit of complete annexation. Bar said their actions should not be described as criminality but as terrorism. \u201cIt isn\u2019t crime because it\u2019s the use of violence to create intimidation, to spread fear. That is terror,\u201d he wrote, describing how the campaign had \u201csignificantly expanded\u201d in the absence of an adequate police response and with the connivance of some national leaders. The militants had gone from using \u201ccigarette lighters to the weapons of war\u201d, the security chief said, adding that some of those weapons had been provided by the state. The terror campaign, the letter said, was \u201ca large stain on Judaism and on all of us\u201d. Bar warned the hilltop youth had gone \u201cfrom evading the security forces to attacking the security forces, from cutting themselves off from the establishment to receiving legitimacy from certain officials in the establishment\u201d. The Shin Bet director also referred to the \u201cspectacle\u201d of Ben-Gvir\u2019s visit last month to the compound of al-Aqsa mosque and Dome of the Rock, Islam\u2019s holiest site in Jerusalem. The esplanade is also holy to Jews who know it as the Temple Mount, but the status quo for decades has been that while Jews could visit, only Muslims could pray there. During his 18 July visit, Ben-Gvir led prayers in front of the cameras and vowed to change the status quo permanently. Such actions, Bar warned, could lead \u201cto profuse bloodshed and change the face of the state out of all recognition\u201d. The security chief, who has been in the post since 2021, said he had reluctantly decided to send the letter \u201cwith pain and great fear, as a Jew, as an Israeli and as a security official, about the escalating phenomenon of Jewish terrorism from the \u2018hilltop youth\u2019\u201d, which he felt was approaching a tipping point. \u201cWe\u2019re on the threshold of a significant, reality-changing process,\u201d Bar wrote. \u201cThe damage to Israel, especially at this time, and to the majority of the settlers is indescribable: a loss of global legitimacy even among our best friends, deploying IDF forces at a time the army, which isn\u2019t meant to deal with these missions, is finding it difficult to carry out all its tasks.\u201d The nationalist leadership, Bar concluded, was \u201cwilling to jeopardise the state\u2019s security and its very existence\u201d in the name of their ideology. N12 reported that Ben-Gvir had walked out of a meeting of Israel\u2019s security cabinet after Bar\u2019s letter arrived, and called for his dismissal. Netanyahu has not so far tried to oust Bar but has been critical of the Shin Bet chief and David Barnea, the director of the external spy agency, the Mossad, for their role as negotiators in Gaza peace talks, implying they were willing to sacrifice Israel\u2019s security to reach a deal to release hostages being held by Hamas. \u201cI am facing the security establishment and the negotiating leaders alone,\u201d Netanyahu said, in remarks quoted by N12. \u201cThey display weakness and are only trying to find ways to concede, whereas I insist on the state of Israel\u2019s interests and am not willing to capitulate to demands that will undermine security.\u201d In the spat between Bar and Ben-Gvir however, Netanyahu\u2019s defence minister sided with the security chief. \u201cIn the face of Minister Ben-Gvir\u2019s irresponsible actions that endanger the national security of the state of Israel and create an internal division in the nation, [the Shin Bet chief] and his people are doing their duty and warning against the serious consequences of these actions,\u201d Gallant said on the X social media platform. Ben-Gvir hit back on X, telling Gallant to stop attacking him and \u201cto start attacking Hezbollah\u201d, egging on the defence chief to start a preemptive war in Lebanon, a longstanding demand of the Israeli right."

Rex William Henry Clark, 18, and Sofija Vinogradova, 19, were both charged with preparation of terrorist acts. Vinogradova, who was arrested on suspicion of possessing a firearm, was also charged with two counts of collection of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. Both were due to appear at Westminster magistrates court on Friday. Police said the investigation into the two teenagers \u2013 who were arrested in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire \u2013 was not prompted by far-right riots that broke out across the country after three girls were stabbed to death in Southport. Commander Dominic Murphy, the head of the Met\u2019s counter-terrorism command, said: \u201cThese are extremely serious charges, but I would urge the public not to speculate any further about this case at this time and allow the criminal justice process to run its course unimpeded. \u201cWhile we are not able to comment in any detail about the investigation now that these charges have been brought, I want to reassure the public that at this time we do not believe that there is any wider threat related to this investigation, although our investigation very much continues.\u201d On 4 August, officers from the counter-terrorism command arrested Vinogradova on suspicion of being in possession of a firearm and collection of information likely to be of use to a terrorist. Detectives carried out a search at the address and she was taken to a London police station before being released on bail pending further inquiries. On 10 August, the woman was arrested again at an address in Cheshunt. Clark was arrested at the same address. Further searches were carried out at the address in Cheshunt, as well as another address in Ilford. Detectives subsequently obtained a warrant of further detention, lasting until Saturday, for both the man and the woman."

            "date": "2024-08-02T17:30:37Z",
            "content": "There is no neat exit point from grief. Each anniversary, each life event, each addition to or loss from the family, can bring renewed pain to the bereaved. For relatives of the almost 3,000 killed in the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, that suffering has been compounded by the lack of accountability for their deaths. This week, the US announced that it had reached a plea deal with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, described as the attack\u2019s architect, and two accomplices, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak Bin \u2018Attash, and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al-Hawsawi. They will avoid the death penalty, instead receiving life sentences in exchange for pleading guilty to all the offences with which they were charged. Negotiations continue with two more men. All have been in US custody since 2002, and are held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, in Cuba. For many relatives, there is anger that there will be no trial, and in some cases that the men will not be executed. But for others there is some relief that after 23 years there is a kind of conclusion to the case, however partial and unsatisfactory. Last year, Fionnuala N\u00ed Aol\u00e1in, the first UN rights investigator to be allowed to visit since the camp\u2019s establishment, described its use of torture as \u201ca betrayal of the rights of victims\u201d of terrorism, as well as breaching the rights of those who had spent more than two decades in indefinite detention. Torture was not merely the standard operating procedure at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. It was its raison d\u2019etre. Men were taken there because it lay outside the rule of law. The abuse, however, made it essentially impossible to proceed with material derived from their interrogations, even under the conditions of a military tribunal rather than a criminal trial. Victims of torture lie so that it will stop. This week\u2019s plea deals are not a vindication of the site\u2019s existence: quite the opposite. Over a decade of pretrial hearings have been absorbed by litigating torture, rather than establishing responsibility for terrorism. While conditions have improved, Prof N\u00ed Aol\u00e1in, then the special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, wrote that detainees were still subject to \u201ccruel, inhuman and degrading treatment\u201d, in addition to living with the \u201cunrelenting harms\u201d from previous abuses. Several have killed themselves; others have been left with severe mental illness. Guant\u00e1namo Bay should never have been opened. This was the conclusion not only of human rights groups and lawyers, but of the US general tasked with setting up the detention camp, Michael Lehnert. Even without considering the moral and legal case, he \u2013 like others \u2013 quickly concluded that many detainees had little intelligence value, and insufficient evidence linking them to war crimes. Of the hundreds kept there, only 18 have been charged with a crime. In 2009, Barack Obama, then US president, vowed to shut the facility within a year. But despite releases and transfers, around 30 men are still held, at a cost of around $14m each annually. The conclusion of a legal process \u2013 however inadequate \u2013 means that for some, the detention camp will become more akin to a prison. But as Maj Gen Lehnert wrote almost a decade ago, it is hard to overstate the damage caused by its continuing existence. Repressive governments use it to deflect attacks on their own policies; violent extremists employ it as a recruiting tool.

            "title": "Worst far-right violence should be treated as terrorism, says ex-police chief",
            "date": "2024-08-05T19:28:06Z",
            "content": "The worst of the far-right violence seen in England this weekend should be treated as terrorism, a prominent former police chief has said, amid warnings over a new wave of unrest targeting migration lawyers. Police have made 378 arrests since the violence broke out last week, with rioters setting fire to a library, looting shops and storming hotels housing asylum seekers. A far-right-led mob tried to set fire to the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham on Sunday while people were inside. Some masked rioters hurled pieces of wood, bottles and chairs, and sprayed fire extinguishers at police officers, 12 of whom were injured. Neil Basu, Britain\u2019s former head of counter-terrorism, said he believed the attack should be treated as an act of terrorism as he condemned the rioters as \u201cbullies and cowards\u201d. \u201cTrying to set ablaze a building with people inside, whom you have made clear you detest, is an act of violence against people and property with a racial cause designed to intimidate a section of the public \u2013 be it Muslims or asylum seekers,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only does it fit the definition of terrorism, it is terrorism. It\u2019s nothing short of an attempt at a modern-day lynching and the people who did it should be facing life imprisonment, not a five-year sentence for violent disorder.\u201d Basu\u2019s comments came as: Australia, Nigeria, Malaysia and Indonesia issued travel alerts to their nationals living in or visiting the UK, warning them to stay away from demonstrations. Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of NHS England, warned the riots have made many of the health service\u2019s multicultural workforce feel \u201cafraid and unwelcome\u201d and the Royal College of Nursing called on ministers to ensure that anyone who targets nurses \u201cpays a very heavy price\u201d. Ministers announced plans to introduce more than 500 new prison places over the next month to help cope with an influx of accused rioters expected to be held on remand. The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson criticised comments by Elon Musk after the X owner posted that \u201ccivil war is inevitable\u201d in response to a video showing riots in Liverpool. MPs and 60 anti-racist and migrants\u2019 rights organisations called for parliament to be recalled to address the violence and \u201cto ensure that all people and communities of colour are protected\u201d. Keir Starmer has rejected the calls, while the Northern Ireland assembly will be recalled later this week to discuss violent scenes after several businesses were attacked at an anti-immigration protest in Belfast on Saturday. The prime minister announced on Monday that a \u201cstanding army\u201d of specialist police officers was being assembled to crack down on rioting as he called for the perpetrators to be named and shamed. He vowed to \u201cramp up criminal justice\u201d after an emergency Cobra meeting was called in the wake of the disorder that erupted after the killing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club in Southport last Monday. Families gathered at a vigil in Southport a week on from the murders of Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice Dasilva Aguiar as children placed flowers and heart-shaped balloons in front of the Atkinson arts centre. One child who was stabbed in the attack remained in hospital and all other patients had been discharged, a spokesperson for Merseyside police said. Several suspects involved in the riots that followed the killings faced charges in court on Monday as the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council warned that the number of arrests was expected to rise each day. There are fears that unrest could continue to spread after a list of solicitors\u2019 firms and advice agencies were shared as targets for gatherings in the coming days. A message believed to have been widely shared on chat groups lists addresses for immigration law specialists and advice organisations across England and invites people to \u201cmask up\u201d if they go. Tell Mama, a group monitoring Islamophobia in the UK, said it had alerted counter-terrorism police to the \u201cfar-right threats on Telegram that seek to target immigration solicitors and refugee services\u201d in more than 30 locations across the country on Wednesday. The Labour MP Stella Creasy said she was looking into a potential target in her east London constituency. There was more unrest on Monday night, this time in Plymouth. Six people were arrested following disorder in the city centre, and several officers suffered minor injuries in the violence, Devon and Cornwall police said. The windows of a police van were also smashed. Supt Russ Dawe said \u201cseveral officers\u201d had been injured in Plymouth and arrests had been made \u201cfor a range of public order offences and assaults\u201d. He said: \u201cSpecialist officers were deployed to the Guildhall in the city centre at around 3.30pm today. During the evening, we\u2019ve seen levels of violence across the city, and several officers have sustained injuries. \u201cI would like to reassure the community that we are fully resourced at this time with a strong police presence. Violence will not be tolerated, hate will not be tolerated, and we continue to work with our partners to keep the people of Plymouth safe.\u201d The Law Society of England and Wales president, Nick Emmerson, condemned the violence that has already taken place, and said the organisation has \u201cserious concerns about the safety and wellbeing of our members\u201d after the list was shared giving \u201ctargets for further protest and violence this week\u201d. Basu, who was the head of counter-terrorism from 2018 to 2021, said the organisers of the protests should also face punishment. \u201cWe overestimate the intelligence of thugs. They don\u2019t think about the consequences of their actions until it\u2019s too late, but jail a few and the others will run back under cover. They are bullies and cowards,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir criminal puppet masters, the organisers, those who encourage, have to be dealt with too. They are also bullies and cowards.\u201d Police believe that violence has been the primary aim of those organising the series of far-right led gatherings in the last week. The chief constable of Essex police, BJ Harrington, who is the national lead for public order, said: \u201cThey are saying they are English patriots and protesting against immigration, but they are intent on thuggery and violence and they do not care about the communities they claim to care about.\u201d He said the groups \u201cmasquerade as protesters\u201d, before adding: \u201cWhat they say and do is quite to the contrary. They are attacking police and the fabric of communities. It\u2019s not protest, it is thuggery.\u201d Harrington was a public order commander in the Metropolitan police when the 2011 riots erupted in London before spreading across England. Asked if the violence this week was as serious as in 2011, Harrington said: \u201cThe implications of it, yes; we have communities across the country in fear and have seen property damage. The scale is not the same. Our response is faster and swifter.\u201d South Yorkshire police, who are leading the investigation into the Rotherham hotel attack, said the case was being dealt with as \u201cmass violent disorder\u201d. A spokesperson for counter-terrorism policing said acts of violence, even if fuelled by hatred, do not necessarily meet the definition of terrorism. They added: \u201cThe racist and anti-immigration attitudes that we have seen both on our streets and online in recent days have no place in recognising the loss felt by families in Southport. \u201cWe continue to bring our specialist capabilities to both the investigation of the incident in Southport and to supporting policing colleagues across the country as they respond to the violent disorder we have seen.\u201d Additional reporting by Rajeev Syal and Denis Campbell"

            "title": "Can the UK fight \u2018extreme misogyny\u2019 as if it were terrorism? I have my doubts | Samira Shackle",
            "date": "2024-08-29T10:00:29Z",
            "content": "When riots broke out in the UK in late July, one of the most prominent voices spreading misinformation was the self-proclaimed misogynist influencer Andrew Tate. The riots came after a horrific knife attack in Southport \u2013 and Tate was among those tweeting, falsely, that the attacker was \u201can illegal immigrant arrived on a boat one month ago\u201d. This is one example of how misogyny intersects with hard-right ideology, and of how the transmission of extremist ideas has changed, with connections forged between different online audiences. People like Tate may build big followings peddling one sort of outrage, misogyny, and then dabble in others to attract new audiences and cross-pollinate ideas \u2013 particularly around big events that offer lots of engagement. The riots demonstrated that the way the hard right organises online is very different now to even seven years ago, when the government last looked at UK counter-extremism strategy. So, it is timely that the new government has commissioned a rapid policy review. Announcing the measure last week the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said it would not only assess the rise of Islamist and hard-right ideologies \u2013 the routine focus of counter-extremism strategy \u2013 but also other trends, including extreme misogyny. While this grabbed headlines, it\u2019s not actually clear what defining misogyny as extremism will mean in practice. Would expressing misogynist views in and of itself be grounds for a referral to Channel, the government\u2019s secretive deradicalisation programme? Would it get these people on the radar of police? Or would the tipping point be the suggestion of some violent intent? (\u201cIncel\u201d ideology has been linked to violent attacks around the world, including in Plymouth in 2021, when 22-year-old Jake Davison killed five people and himself). Misogyny itself is depressingly widespread, so how will the authorities define the point at which it is \u201cextreme\u201d? Would a police officer who shares photos of a dead woman\u2019s body or uses disparaging language about female colleagues be classed an extremist? What about a judge who decides not to convict a man for sexual assault because of the effect it might have on the man\u2019s life? On LBC, home office minister Jess Phillips was asked about the potential risk to free speech and responded: \u201cYou just use the exact same test you would with far-right extremism and Islamism, wouldn\u2019t you? The same test would have to apply.\u201d But looking at the recent history of counter-extremism policy in the UK tells us there is no clear test: in fact, the question of what constitutes an extreme idea, and when it is appropriate for the state to intervene, is hotly contested. When the Preventing Violent Extremism scheme was launched in 2007 in the aftermath of the 2005 London bombings, the emphasis was, as the name suggests, on preventing acts of violence, by fighting \u201cpernicious ideology\u201d. Over the next couple of years, as the strategy was reviewed, the emphasis shifted away from violent extremism to all extremism. While some states view disengagement \u2013 whereby a person rejects violent action \u2013 as a sufficient goal for deradicalisation work, Britain wants the rejection of extremist ideas themselves. When the Prevent strategy was relaunched again in 2015, the focus on extreme ideas \u2013 rather than the risk of violence \u2013 was cemented. \u201cFor too long, we have been a passively tolerant society, saying to our citizens: as long as you obey the law, we will leave you alone,\u201d David Cameron said in May 2015. This raises an obvious question: should the government be targeting people who obey the law? The consensus then, and in the intervening nine years, has been that it should. In effect, the state has moved beyond prohibiting hate speech and incitement to violence, to trying to distinguish between ideas that can be freely expressed and ideas that cannot. Most people probably agree we don\u2019t want to live in a society where a large number of people hold anti-egalitarian or bigoted views. The problem comes in defining which views are unacceptable and to what degree. In one respect, extremism is defined by its distance from mainstream opinion, making it difficult to pin down. Even if you accept the premise that government should be fighting \u2013 or even criminalising \u2013 dangerous or extreme ideas, the central problem remains of how you define those ideas, and how exactly you fight views that are diffuse and widely held. One key criticism of Prevent is that the bar for referral is too low. The 2015 strategy (which is still in place) made it a statutory requirement for teachers, doctors and other public sector employees to report extremism. Numerous human rights organisations have argued that this has led to a chilling effect whereby Muslim students in particular feel less able to express certain views, including criticism of British foreign policy. A 2023 Amnesty report on Prevent, titled This is the Thought Police, said the programme is \u201cstripping people of their basic human rights and hampering their ability to live, work and speak freely\u201d, with referrals often based on little more than a \u201cgut feeling\u201d. It\u2019s far easier for politicians to talk about \u201ccountering hateful beliefs\u201d than to stem the underlying causes of these beliefs. In the years since Prevent was introduced, the economy has stagnated, living standards have dramatically dropped, public services have been hollowed out, meaning that many of the community support services that proved helpful in promoting cohesion have been lost. Announcing a new counter-extremism strategy is a cheaper and more immediate way of being seen to \u201cdo something\u201d, rather than seeking to solve the structural problems that could be driving people towards these beliefs. Yet it is not a risk-free proposal. Responding to the announcement, charity Women\u2019s Aid said: \u201cIf we are to overcome gender-based abuse, past approaches to deradicalisation by previous governments have left us cautious and concerned\u201d, and warned against the issue being \u201cburied within the highly politicised counter-extremism agenda\u201d. If we believe Cooper\u2019s statement that extremism has flourished and grown in recent years, this indicates the current approach is not working. And if that\u2019s the case, then simply adding other forms of ideology won\u2019t do much to solve the problem.

            "date": "2024-08-25T16:00:06Z",
            "content": "Teachers returning to work next month will confront a worrying \u201cbehaviour bubble\u201d as younger children who were most severely affected by the pandemic reach the teenage years renowned for peak classroom disruption. The warning from experts and school leaders in England comes as evidence shows that children of primary school age during the pandemic \u2013 when schools were closed to most pupils \u2013 have been accruing exclusions and suspensions at a record pace since moving to secondary school. The most recent official figures, for 2022-23, show that the fastest increases in exclusions and suspensions were among a \u201cbubble\u201d of younger pupils in years 7 and 8. Those pupils will now be in years 9 and 10, when sanctions for misbehaviour are traditionally the highest. Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said there was \u201cno doubt\u201d that worsening levels of behaviour have escalated into a crisis since the pandemic, and warned that there could be worse to come. \u201cIn the aftermath of the riots in many towns and cities during the summer, we also need to see government and other agencies stepping up to work with our schools and colleges to support vulnerable young people who are at risk of being drawn into violence,\u201d Roach said. He added: \u201cWhile the Covid pandemic highlighted the failures of government policy, it also amplified those failures, as more and more teachers reported being sworn at, threatened, shoved, kicked, bitten or punched and attacked by pupils carrying weapons.\u201d A government source said: \u201cThe merry-go-round of Tory ministers in recent years failed to grip the rising tide of poor behaviour pre-pandemic and then told children and their families they\u2019d \u2018maxed out\u2019 on Covid recovery support. This government will do the hard yards and get to the root of much of the bad behaviour blighting our schools with a support-first approach that gets control of our classrooms once again.\u201d The Department for Education\u2019s (DfE) most recent behaviour data for England\u2019s state schools shows the proportion of year 7 pupils who received at least one suspension rose from 3.5% in the year before the pandemic to 5.5% in 2022-23, while the rate of year 8 pupils suspended rose from 5.5% to more than 8%. Older pupils in year 9 and year 10 had close to 10% of pupils receiving at least one suspension in 2022-23, also well above pre-pandemic levels. More worryingly, the rate of exclusions at secondary schools rose fastest among year 7 and year 8 pupils, particularly among girls. Before and during the pandemic, roughly three boys were excluded for each girl \u2013 but the ratio in 2022-23 moved to nearly two to one, with 1,000 more female exclusions compared with 2018-19. Andrew Old, a secondary school teacher and blogger who identified the trend of rising exclusions among younger pupils and girls, said: \u201cNext year\u2019s year 9s and year 10s could be the most challenging for many years. However, that may depend on whether schools have successfully addressed the behaviour of those pupils in the years they have already been at secondary school.\u201d A DfE spokesperson said: \u201cThe rising number of school suspensions and permanent exclusions are shocking, and show the massive scale of disruptive behaviour that has developed in schools across the country in recent years, harming the life chances of children. \u201cWe are determined to get to grips with the causes of poor behaviour: we\u2019ve already committed to providing access to specialist mental health professionals in every school, introducing free breakfast clubs in every primary school and ensuring earlier intervention in mainstream schools for pupils with special needs. \u201cBut we know poor behaviour can also be rooted in wider issues, which is why the government is developing an ambitious strategy to reduce child poverty led by a taskforce co-chaired by the education secretary so that we can break down the barriers to opportunity.\u201d Tom Bennett, a DfE adviser on behaviour management, said: \u201cI think that the idea of a \u2018behaviour bubble\u2019 moving up the pipe is possible but not certain. I would speculate that the experience of home schooling during lockdown may well be responsible for the deterioration of some social skills, which, like truancy, will be disproportionately concentrated in sub-groups who were already most at risk of misbehaving. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t guarantee that they will remain so chaotic forever. They could, for instance, readjust to the socialising effect of being back at school. It may be that these effects don\u2019t persist in an environment of structure and boundaries. \u201cOn the other hand, the effect may well be sustainable, and we may well see a bubble move up and create, with the effects of adolescence, a perfect storm.\u201d While poverty and an increasing proportion of pupils with special needs may be factors behind the recent increases in sanctions, exclusion rates in primary schools and among year 11 pupils remain around or below those seen before the pandemic, suggesting that the disruption experienced by pupils moving up to secondary school has had an outsized impact. Lee Wilson, the chief executive of the Outwood Grange Academies Trust, said: \u201cMany parts of our society are still feeling the effects of Covid. Its legacy in schools \u2013 the result of lockdowns and school closures \u2013 has led to weaker academic outcomes nationally, lower attendance and poorer behaviour, especially among disadvantaged children and in schools which were already struggling or were at the start of their transformation.\u201d Bennett added: \u201cI think the pandemic disruption plus \u2013 I hate to say it \u2013 a burgeoning reliance on social media and smartphones has desocialised the cohort, giving them somewhere to invest their attention spans and cognitive bandwidth on pursuits that are essentially trivial and worthless.\u201d Pepe Di\u2019Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the behaviour issues affecting younger children may continue to be a challenge as they progress through school. \u201cThe sad reality is that schools and children have been let down by more than a decade of underfunding both in education and the broader network of local services. This is the result,\u201d Di\u2019Iasio said."

            "title": "Fifty English secondary schools suspended more than a quarter of pupils after pandemic",
            "date": "2024-08-25T16:00:06Z",
            "content": "Fifty secondary schools in England suspended more than a quarter of their students after the pandemic, with children at schools with the most disadvantaged pupils three times as likely to be suspended as those in wealthier areas, according to analysis by the Guardian. The proportion of schools suspending large numbers of pupils has risen sharply since schools were closed to many children during Covid, and teachers have struggled with deteriorating behaviour since they reopened. The number of secondary schools that sent away a quarter or more of their pupils rose to 50 in 2022-23, double the 24 that did so in 2018-19, according to data published by the Department for Education (DfE). Of the 50 schools, five are run by Dixons Academies Trust and three each by Outwood Grange Academies Trust (OGAT) and Northern Education Trust. Three of the schools suspended more than 37% of their pupils in 2022-23: Dixons Croxteth academy in Liverpool, Outwood academy Kirkby in Nottinghamshire and Outwood academy Bishopsgarth in Stockton-on-Tees. Luke Sparkes, the chief executive of Dixons Academies Trust, said his trust exclusively took on schools in disadvantaged communities with \u201cserious problems\u201d dating back years. \u201cWhen we arrive in these schools, they are very often characterised by bad behaviour \u2013 bullying, behaviour that puts other children and staff in danger, and constant disruption of lessons which means children who want to learn are stopped from doing well,\u201d Sparkes said. \u201cWe never want to suspend or exclude any student. But we also can\u2019t accept situations where children are in danger, are unhappy or can\u2019t learn. Our behaviour policies are clear and we apply sanctions consistently and fairly \u2013 everyone knows where they stand, and everyone receives high-quality support to achieve the expectations we set. \u201d Lee Wilson, the chief executive of OGAT, which operates in the north of England and the Midlands, said the trust included schools in areas of high deprivation that faced multiple challenges. \u201cThese schools have been transformed by OGAT. They now provide students with a great education and the best chance to lead successful lives. Our schools have never been so popular with parents and local authorities have expanded several of them so they can take even more students,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cTrusts like ours \u2013 and there are many \u2013 are working hard to get these schools to the best possible place and to support all students, in particular younger ones who joined secondary school at such a disjointed time, to achieve what we know they can so they can lead successful lives.\u201d The DfE\u2019s national figures for 2022-23 showed a record 257,000 students were sent away for at least part of the school day after receiving one of the 787,000 suspensions issued during the school year. The DfE said there \u201cwill always be a need for suspensions as a last resort, and we back headteachers to make those decisions whilst we work in tandem to tackle the causes of poor behaviour to prevent suspensions\u201d. On average, 7% of pupils at each secondary school received at least one suspension. But the rate was far higher in some parts of the country: Stoke-on-Trent and Middlesbrough recorded double the national rate with 14% of their pupils suspended during the year. Suspensions were also concentrated in schools serving the most deprived communities across England. In 2022-23 the secondary schools in the top fifth in terms of children on free school meals suspended 11.5% of pupils at least once, compared with 3.4% of pupils at schools with the fewest children on free meals. Tom Bennett, an expert on pupil behaviour who advises the DfE, said it was not remarkable that some schools suspended pupils at higher rates than others, as there was no \u201cright\u201d level of suspensions. \u201cObviously averages are just that, and some will be above, some will be below. Schools that serve more disadvantaged communities will almost by definition use disciplinary methods more frequently,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cSuspending might actually be the right thing to do. What are the school outcomes? Are kids doing well? Maybe the suspensions keep them safe. Suspensions are not a good or bad thing intrinsically, they are a strategy.\u201d Rates of suspension for individual schools vary widely from year to year due to differing policies or enforcement of behaviour codes, or whether schools prefer to use internal exclusions. Since the pandemic 45% of schools had higher suspension rates in 2022-23 than 2018-19, while 9% had lower rates. Six OGAT academies were among the schools that reduced suspensions the most."

            "date": "2024-08-04T06:00:25Z",
            "content": "Trainee doctors are at higher risk of burnout now than during the pandemic, with some describing how they have struggled with unsustainable workloads and inadequate support. The most recent figures published by the General Medical Council (GMC) in its national training survey of junior doctors and their trainers reveal the proportion of trainees feeling \u201cat a high or moderate risk\u201d of burnout is 63%. This is higher than in 2020 and 2021 during the pandemic, when the figures were 43% and 56% respectively, although a slight fall on last year. Mike Greenhalgh, deputy co-chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) junior doctors committee, said: \u201cThe burnout statistics from the GMC are shocking but sadly unsurprising \u2013 as too is the increasing trend of doctors taking time out of training, or choosing careers abroad and outside the NHS.\u201d The GMC survey \u2013 the largest annual survey of doctors in the UK \u2013 asked 74,000 physicians about their working environments, quality of training, wellbeing at work and workloads. It found 32% of trainees in emergency medicine were at high risk of burnout, the highest figure of any specialisation. \u201cThe survey results remain very concerning,\u201d the report said. \u201cA third of trainees in emergency medicine posts [are] measured to be at high risk of burnout, suggesting unsustainable workplace pressures have become the norm in this speciality.\u201d The warnings over the pressures faced by trainees come as the health secretary, Wes Streeting, hopes to resolve the dispute with junior doctors. The government and the BMA, the doctors\u2019 union, have struck an improved pay deal for junior doctors in England worth about 22% on average over two years. Members will now vote on whether to accept the deal. Victoria Selwyn, 27, a junior doctor, said that in addition to better pay, there needed to be more recognition that trainees were feeling burned out, as well as improved support. She said she was well trained, but that nothing can prepare a junior doctor caring at night for \u201ctwo or three hundred patients\u201d with one registrar across seven floors of a hospital. She described trying to stabilise deteriorating patients at night until her registrar was available. \u201cEveryone is stretched \u2026 and on these nights, your bleep is just constantly going off,\u201d she said. \u201cYour job ends up being multiple jobs and you\u2019re trying to split yourself a million different ways. You\u2019re wondering how you are meant to get through and prioritise the patients. You feel like you\u2019re spread too thin.\u201d She said there were challenges of a lack of staff during her training, with several colleagues needing time off from burnout. Selwyn added it could be demoralising that after such an intensive training environment it was often difficult to find a job in a chosen specialism. She hopes to train in psychiatry and believes more training posts would help create a better job structure for junior doctors. Michael West, professor of work and organisational psychology at Lancaster University, said: \u201cIf you wanted to design about the worst possible job at the start of somebody\u2019s career, the job of a junior doctor is it.\u201d West, co-author of the 2019 GMC report Caring for Doctors, Caring for Patients, said a lack of autonomy, poor working conditions and a culture of blame had contributed to a \u201ctoxic cocktail\u201d for junior doctors. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be effective and treat every patient as a human being.\u201d More than 9,000 junior doctors start work in hospitals each year across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Many take time off during or after their initial two years of work, with significant numbers complaining of stress and overwork. Nathan Robinson, 28, said he took time off from stress within six months of starting as a junior doctor in the summer of 2021. He said there was a \u201cmismatch\u201d between how medical students envisaged their profession and the reality of frontline roles. Robinson said while the workloads were gruelling, he found it particularly difficult that there was a lack of support and a blame culture when things went wrong. \u201cI never knew what I was going into,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it going to be understaffed? Is someone going to deteriorate?\u201d On one occasion in his second year of hospital training, he was the only doctor in his emergency unit dealing with \u201cmajors\u201d \u2013 patients attending with moderate to serious health complaints. He said he was assessing \u201cpatient after patient\u201d with no time to stop and think. \u201cWe forget sometimes there are lives on the line,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are working 150% pretty much all the time, but no one seems to appreciate it.\u201d Robinson said there was no support or learning after particularly difficult shifts. \u201cI would come home, sit down and think: \u2018Wow, what even just happened?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe next day, it\u2019s like everything that happened the day before is a clean slate. No debrief. Nothing.\u201d A survey of 10,000 medical students by the British Medical Journal last year found that one in three UK medical students planned to leave the NHS within two years of graduating \u2013 either to practise abroad or to abandon medicine altogether. Some trainees say the frustrations and discontent have been compounded this year by a new system of allocation for their hospital training programme. While most get their top preference location, others are asked to move hundreds of miles from their home. Prof Colin Melville, medical director and director of education and standards at the GMC, said: \u201cOur analysis shows high risk of burnout is strongly associated with high workloads, a lack of or disruption of time to train, and feeling unsupported.\u201d An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cThe findings from this report demonstrate the continued need to support the training and working lives of doctors and the importance of recognising the risk of burnout for doctors in training and the doctors who train them. We know there is more to do and so we are strengthening occupational health services and reviewing our mental health and treatment offer for staff to ensure everyone working in the NHS has the right support they need.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThe deal being put to doctors will increase pay for junior doctors and see the BMA, NHS England and government work together to improve conditions, including by reviewing the current rotation system.\u201d"

            "title": "Teen mental health in US has improved post-pandemic, new CDC data says",
            "date": "2024-08-11T11:00:12Z",
            "content": "A recently released study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows levels of sadness and hopelessness are improving in some US teenagers, and notably among girls. However,, the survey and experts said, challenges remain, as some metrics worsened in the most recent report. Of particular concern is a growing group of students who missed school because they did not feel safe. \u201cI was pleased to see a little bit of improvement\u201d in teenagers\u2019 mental health, Hedy Chang, executive director of Attendance Works, a nonprofit that works to reduce chronic absenteeism, told the Guardian. \u201cI think schools heard the message that they needed to invest more in social-emotional support and in a sense of belonging.\u201d It was a message echoed by top officials at the CDC, that came with a caveat: \u201cThe data released today show improvements to a number of metrics that measure young people\u2019s mental wellbeing \u2013 progress we can build on,\u201d said Dr Debra Houry, CDC\u2019s chief medical officer and deputy director for program and science, said in a release accompanying the data. \u201cHowever, this work is far from complete,\u201d said Houry. \u201cEvery child should feel safe and supported, and CDC will continue its work to turn this data into action until we reach that goal.\u201d The new data is drawn from the CDC\u2019s Youth Risk Behavior survey, an every-other-year report on sexual behavior, substance use, violent experiences and mental health among ninth-12th grade students. The survey measures these experiences across six demographics, including gender, sexual identity, race, ethnicity and grade, and began in 1990. This report reflects data from 2023, and provides the survey\u2019s first update since 2021. Then, in the teeth of the Covid-19 pandemic, experts saw a worrying deterioration in youth mental health that led the American Academy of Pediatrics to call for a national emergency declaration to address the crisis. Shoots of hope emerged between 2021 and 2023, according to the data. The overall number of students who report persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness has decreased from 42% to 40%. The number of female students who felt the same also decreased, from 57% to 53%. Hispanic students also reported a drop in feelings of persistent sadness (down from 46% to 42%), lower rates of poor mental health (from 30% to 26%), and decreases in who seriously considered a suicide attempt (22% to 18%) and who made a suicide plan (19% to 16%). Black students were also significantly less likely to report a suicide attempt in this survey (from 14% to 10%), and fewer were injured in suicide attempts (from 4% to 2%). Other challenges persist. The report continues to show disparities in youth mental health experienced by girls and LGBTQ+ students. Girls fare worse than male counterparts on nearly every measure of substance use, experiences of violence, mental health and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. LGBTQ+ youth face similar disparities, with three in five experiencing persistent feelings of sadness of hopelessness. Worrying, the survey also found worsening concerning trends in school safety. More students were bullied at school (15% to 19%) between 2021-2023, and more students missed school because of safety concerns (increasing from 9% to 13%). The percentage of students who were threatened or injured at school also increased (7% to 9%). The percentage of girls and Asian American students who said they missed school because of safety was even more dramatic, respectively growing from 10% to 16% and doubling for Asian Americans, from 5% to 10%. \u201cI\u2019m Chinese American, and personally I feel less safe in the United States than I did 10 years ago,\u201d said Chang. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that one of the groups that feels most nervous is Asian American kids.\u201d Chang continued: \u201cWhen we\u2019re in a world outside that blames people \u2013 blames people for the pandemic, says they\u2019re a threat to the wellbeing of society \u2013 you worry both about how that plays out in schools. Schools are always, in part, a reflection of the world outside.\u201d"

            "title": "\u2018It\u2019s happening on the scale of a pandemic\u2019: the drug-resistant infections killing African babies",
            "date": "2024-08-08T11:00:06Z",
            "content": "Her tiny body hooked up to machines twice her size, her mother standing vigil at the side of her cot, Yusra was in a struggle for life. The baby had severe sepsis, which meant her body had turned on itself \u2013 her immune system attacking her organs. Doctors tried different antibiotics but none of the drugs were working. Yusra and her twin had been born two months premature, by caesarean section, in Woldia, a hill town in the Amhara region of northern Ethiopia where rebel and government forces are in violent conflict. Two years earlier, the hospital had been raided by a militia which stripped it of vital supplies. At six days old, Yusra\u2019s sister died for want of a blood transfusion. Fearing she would lose her second daughter too, Yusra\u2019s mother took her on a five-hour journey, past numerous military checkpoints, to a specialist hospital in Dessie. Sepsis accounts for one in three newborn deaths in Ethiopia. The condition, whereby the body overreacts to an infection, can be stopped by tackling infections with antibiotics. In Yusra\u2019s case, doctors had treated her with \u201cfirst-line\u201d antibiotics \u2013 drugs that are used on infections in the first instance \u2013 which proved ineffective. As they cycled through other types of antibiotics, the baby\u2019s condition deteriorated. Even if the doctors did find one that could save Yusra\u2019s life, her mother might not be able to afford it. Yusra has become a statistic in a growing global emergency. Increasingly, infections that would once have been easily managed with antibiotics are no longer responding to the drugs. In 2019, drug-resistant infections were linked to nearly five million deaths globally \u2013 more than HIV and malaria combined. More than 20% occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, where the drugs that do exist can be in short supply, incorrectly prescribed and prohibitively priced. \u201cIt\u2019s happening on the scale of a pandemic,\u201d Prof Nicholas Feasey, of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine tells the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. \u201cAfrican babies are dying in huge numbers because of this very widespread and severe illness.\u201d Antibiotics are the cornerstone of modern medicine. Without them, the risk of a deadly infection is present every time anyone undergoes routine surgery, gives birth or cuts themselves falling over. Since the Scottish microbiologist Sir Alexander Fleming discovered the first antibiotic in 1928, it has been estimated that almost 500 million lives have been saved by penicillin alone. But antibiotics are fighting a moving target. The bacteria that cause infections react to their surroundings and, if given the opportunity, \u201clearn\u201d ways to fend off the drugs designed to kill them. In the last 25 years there has been an almost 50% increase in the amount of antibiotics used globally. They are increasingly prescribed by doctors as a first recourse for conditions that may not require them, while wealthy patients can demand what they think is a cure-all. Where resources are scarce, lack of access to diagnostic testing and vaccines can leave doctors with little choice. Overuse of these drugs \u2013 combined with a lack of clean water, sanitation and hygiene \u2013 has driven an alarming increase in antibiotic resistance, with medical progress against infections from typhoid to pneumonia in effect being reversed. Dessie\u2019s neonatal intensive-care ward has 50 beds. With referrals coming from across the region, the unit is constantly at full capacity. In a separate room to Yusra, a mother was breastfeeding her newborn, called Adonias, who was also battling an infection. Following complications during his birth, Adonias was showing signs of neonatal sepsis \u2013 trouble breathing, fever, poor feeding and tiredness. The family\u2019s local hospital did not have the tests to identify the bacteria causing the infection and therefore which antibiotics would have the best chance of treating it. They took a shot in the dark and prescribed Adonias the antibiotics most commonly used for sepsis. When days passed without improvement, Adonias and his mother travelled eight hours to Dessie. But again, the hospital did not have the tests and the doctors had to gamble. \u201cWe usually have to treat them blindly,\u201d says Tarekegn Bitew, a neonatal doctor in the Dessie unit. \u201cIf they don\u2019t improve with the first-line antibiotics, we suspect clinical drug resistance and blindly prescribe second-line antibiotics.\u201d The high concentration of sick people and widespread presence of antibiotics in hospitals can lead to bacteria surviving, getting stronger and spreading between patients. The wrong antibiotics prescribed by guesswork mean bacteria will continue to multiply and a patient\u2019s condition will worsen. In another neonatal ward, this time in Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s largest city, Eniyoha, just a few weeks old, had been abandoned by her parents. Eniyoha\u2019s file was thick with notes detailing her condition, complications and treatments. She had been born eight weeks early with birth defects that would mean lifelong physical impairments. Her parents left without explanation; hospital staff thought it likely that they could not afford the hospital bill. Like almost all of the babies admitted here, Eniyoha had drug-resistant neonatal sepsis. With resources limited, staff swabbed the ward daily for bacteria, sending samples for tests in government laboratories; results were compiled and used to decide which drugs to use. So even without the means to test every baby, the staff now had a cheat sheet: a list of antibiotics with a higher chance of success. In Nigeria, one in 25 babies dies before they are a month old. Sepsis is one of the main causes. For premature babies such as Eniyoha, the odds of surviving a drug-resistant infection are low. Eniyoha had not responded to first or second-line antibiotics, so doctors were trying a third. In Nigeria, hospitals do not cover the costs of drugs, and for now, donations were being used to foot the bill. \u201cWe come across parents that can\u2019t afford treatment every day,\u201d says Folakemi Irewole-Ojo, medical director of the hospital, referring to the costs faced by patients needing antibiotics. \u201cIt\u2019s the long duration of treatment \u2013 by the time the preterm babies have spent two weeks here, [the parents\u2019] pocket is dry.\u201d It is the same in Ethiopia, where hospitals cover some drugs but not all, so trying the cheaper drugs first is standard. But if these fail, and a baby needs so-called \u201clast-resort\u201d antibiotics such as meropenem, then the hospital cannot cover the costs. A full course \u2013 about 20 vials \u2013 can cost five times average monthly earnings. \u201cIf we had testing in this hospital, we would be able to improve patient management,\u201d says Bitew. \u201cIt would also decrease the costs for the families.\u201d One vial of meropenem might sometimes be shared between three babies, to make the most of scant resources, but at the risk of encouraging infections across wards. Unsanitised equipment in hospitals with little clean water risks further contamination. \u201cHaving to share hospital equipment is a major source of drug-resistant infections among neonates,\u201d says Jonathan Strysko, an epidemiologist in Botswana. \u201cIt\u2019s the fact hospitals have major reservoirs [of bacteria], like equipment that can never be fully cleaned. \u201cWe need different ways of looking at infection prevention and controls in the hospital setting.\u201d In Lagos, the doctors\u2019 comprehensive notes and observations had done their job: Eniyoha\u2019s infection cleared. Social services are now trying to trace her parents. Back in Dessie, Adonias also continued to improve and was discharged from hospital. But Yusra did not respond to second-line antibiotics. Her mother tried to get hold of meropenem. It was on sale at pharmacies just outside the hospital gates, but she did not have the money to pay for it. Yusra died five days later. \u201cMost of the patients die,\u201d said Bitew. \u201cSome of them do improve.\u201d Patient access to testing equipment, vaccinations, clean water, sanitation and hygiene need to be addressed, says Feasey, warning that otherwise: \u201cThe frailest members of African society will continue to die.\u201d This story was produced in collaboration with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism"
