            "content": "The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has admitted it would take time for a Labour government to turn Britain around, as she accused the Conservatives of vandalising the economy over the past 14 years. Speaking before next week\u2019s budget, Reeves said the party that wins the next election would have the worst inheritance of any incoming government since the war and that a national mission was needed to kickstart the economy. \u201cI recognise the dire inheritance we would have if we win the election. I am not going to be able to turn everything round overnight. We are going to have to grow the economy. There will be a relentless focus on what we need to grow the economy,\u201d the shadow chancellor said. Referring to a soundbite used by George Osborne before the Conservatives came to power in 2010, Reeves said: \u201cGeorge Osborne promised to fix the nation\u2019s roof. But the Conservatives have broken the windows, kicked the door in and now they\u2019re burning the house down.\u201d Jeremy Hunt is putting the finishing touches to next Wednesday\u2019s budget, with the Treasury massaging down expectations of the size of an anticipated tax giveaway in light of deteriorating forecasts for the public finances from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which will give its final, confidential pre-budget assessment to the Treasury on Friday. \u201cI am not going pre-empt what the chancellor does or the forecasts published by the OBR,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cHowever, we do know that the budget will paint a picture of 14 years of economic failure. The next government \u2013 Conservative or Labour \u2013 will inherit the worst set of economic circumstances since the second world war.\u201d Sketching out Labour\u2019s critique of the government\u2019s economic record since 2010, Reeves said public debt as a share of national output was at the highest level since the 1960s; debt interest payments were at the highest level since the second world war; taxes as a share of national output were the highest since 1949; the economy was smaller than when Rishi Sunak became prime minister in October 2022; and the current parliament was on track to be the first in which living standards \u2013 as measured by real household disposable incomes \u2013 fell. \u201cThere needs to be a national mission to kickstart our economy\u201d, she said. \u201cInstead, we\u2019re having a debate in the Conservative party about headroom and what\u2019s best for Rishi Sunak\u2019s leadership.\u201d Hunt will use next week\u2019s speech to say the worst is over for the economy and that it is already recovering from the mild recession that it slipped into in the second half of 2023. But the chancellor\u2019s room for manoeuvre is limited by official forecasts showing he will meet one of his fiscal rules \u2013 to have national debt falling in five years\u2019 time \u2013 by the narrowest of margins. Reeves has been reluctant to say whether Labour would support any tax cuts Hunt might announce next week, preferring to wait until the OBR publishes its judgment on the the impact of Hunt\u2019s measures after the budget. She rejected accusations that Labour\u2019s plan for the economy differed little from that of the Conservatives. \u201cPeople will see a real change in our economy under Labour. People will see something they haven\u2019t seen for a long time: an economy that\u2019s growing and creating prosperity,\u201d she said. Reeves said Labour\u2019s growth plan was built on three pillars: stability, investment and reform."

            "title": "Record long-term sickness bodes ill for UK economic growth",
            "date": "2024-02-17T17:00:20Z",
            "content": "Britain has a sick economy and it is getting sicker. The clear message from last week\u2019s raft of economic data is that the UK is being held back by the growing number of people not able to work because of long-term illness. There are many theories about why the trend is worsening. Possible factors include long Covid, delays in NHS treatment as waiting lists grow longer, poor workplace practices, stress and the impact of austerity. But one thing is certain. The economic impact of ill health is a headache for Jeremy Hunt. It will be a headache for Rachel Reeves if she becomes the first female chancellor. It is a headache for every business that is struggling to fill vacancies. Figures released last week by the Office for National Statistics illustrated the extent of the problem. The number of people saying they are inactive due to long-term sickness is now 2.8 million \u2013 an increase of more than 200,000 in the past year and of 700,000 since the pandemic started in 2020. This matters, and not just for those who would be working if their circumstances were different. This high level of long-term illness helps explain why the UK\u2019s workforce is 700,000 smaller than its pre-Covid level, why the labour market is so tight and why the economy is flatlining. Jane Gratton, deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cBusinesses are growing increasingly concerned about higher levels of inactivity and its economic impact. It is impacting on growth and inflation. Wages are rising because of skills shortages. This has an effect on both employers and individuals.\u201d This is not a new issue. Large numbers of employees were invalided out of the workforce when factories and coalmines were closed in the de-industrialisation of the 1980s and 1990s. This century, Britain has had a higher percentage of people inactive due to ill health than Germany, France or Italy. But two new factors \u2013 Covid and longer NHS waiting lists \u2013 have made matters significantly worse in recent years. Yet what\u2019s especially worrying for economic policymakers is that Britain has gone from being the G7 country with the lowest levels of inactivity to the one where, uniquely, the workforce has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. The Office for Budget Responsibility has pointed out: \u201cThe available international evidence suggests that while the UK has consistently been a strong performer internationally in terms of working-age participation, its post-pandemic rise in inactivity stands out. And ill health has consistently been a bigger factor behind inactivity in the UK than in most other advanced economies, with post-pandemic trends likely to have amplified these differences.\u201d While it would be tempting to dub Britain the sick man of Europe, it would not be strictly accurate. Feminist thinktank the Women\u2019s Budget Group (WBG) has pointed out that there are 200,000 more women than men inactive due to ill health (1.5 million against 1.3 million). The WBG says this is not just down to Covid, but continues a trend that was evident before the pandemic. Zubaida Haque, the WBG\u2019s deputy director, said women were more likely to be in low-paid jobs and suffering the impact of austerity. \u201cThis has not been happening in a vacuum. Women were hit disproportionately by the pandemic but they were also more severely impacted by the benefit cuts made between 2010 and 2020. It is no good the government trying to deal with the symptoms of the problem.\u201d Hannah Slaughter, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the 2.8 million people inactive due to long-term sickness were a real concern: \u201cThis is holding back the economy, putting pressure on the public finances and the NHS, and limiting opportunities for too many people. Reversing this trend will be a priority for the current and next government.\u201d According to the Department for Work and Pensions, the government is already on the case. A spokesperson said: \u201cWith an extra 4 million people in work since 2010, we are now going even further, with welfare reforms forecast to reduce the number of people who would otherwise have been placed in the highest tier of incapacity benefits by over 370,000. \u201cOur back to work plan will help over a million people, including those with disabilities and long-term health conditions, to start and stay in work, as we continue to bring down inflation, cut taxes and grow the economy.\u201d One option for the government would be to try to fill the hundreds of thousands of job vacancies by tightening welfare conditions. But experts such as Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation thinktank, have warned that forcing people into work through punitive benefit sanctions would be counterproductive and might lead to more ill health. Whichever approach it decides to take, the government is under pressure to do more, both in terms of preventing illness, and in tailoring back-to-work programmes for those who take time off sick, ensuring that they don\u2019t exit the labour market altogether. While it is inactivity due to ill health that has grabbed the headlines recently, plenty of people with health problems are working, and are more likely to carry on if they get appropriate support. A study by the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank found people were more likely to leave work because of a heart condition than for any other health problem. The IPPR said someone suffering the onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 2021-22 had a 22% likelihood of leaving their job, compared with 14% for those with a mental health problem and 16% for those diagnosed with cancer. Chris Thomas, head of the IPPR\u2019s commission on health and prosperity, said: \u201cAfter great strides in tackling cardiovascular disease in the 20th century, the UK is now stalling, if not reversing. This is costing not just lives, but also livelihoods. The good news is that heart disease is one of the most preventable health conditions, but the government has to get on to the front foot and deliver proactive policies. Both human lives and economic prosperity depend on it.\u201d Gratton at the BCC said firms could help by allowing flexible working, investing more in occupational health and offering staff medical insurance. Jon Boys, senior research economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said the reduction in workers was compounding labour supply difficulties and limiting growth. There was ample evidence of both in last week\u2019s economic data, with the ONS reporting more than 900,000 job vacancies and unemployment below 4%, at a time when the UK economy was in recession. Boys said breaking down barriers to working for people with health problems should be a priority for policymakers and employers. Like Gratton, he said it was vital to focus on occupational health, to prevent individuals from exiting the workforce prematurely: \u201cIt is all very well getting people back into work but the bigger issue is not allowing them to fall out of it in the first place.\u201d Boys said both government and employers needed to address inactivity: employers through an awareness of the impact of stress in the workplace and addressing heavy and unsustainable workloads, and ministers by tackling NHS waiting lists. \u201cThe government has to recognise that health policy is economic policy,\u201d Boys said. \u201cThey can\u2019t be treated in silos.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-15T13:48:52Z",
            "content": "As she stood beside two union flags in a wood-panelled room, it looked as if Rachel Reeves had stepped into Rishi Sunak\u2019s own press conference room in Downing Street \u2013 a deliberate move. The shadow chancellor had been preparing for this moment for months, warning of the heightened risk of recession ever since the last quarter\u2019s GDP figures showed negative growth. Accusing Sunak of putting the economy \u201cinto reverse\u201d and leaving his promise of economic growth \u201cin tatters\u201d, Reeves was keen to imprint one phrase on voters\u2019 minds: \u201cRishi\u2019s recession.\u201d One Labour source said it was \u201can economic and political moment \u2013 for a government to have fallen into recession in an election year, when Rishi Sunak has made his whole argument about growing the economy\u201d. Labour sources say Reeves had wanted to speak directly to the country at such a crucial time, rather than popping up briefly on television screens for a short clip. \u201cThe picture we want the country to see is a competent alternative to what you\u2019ve gone through, doubling down on Rachel\u2019s core strength of people looking at her and trusting her,\u201d one source said. They say Reeves is now gearing up to make the election all about economic competence, having put to bed the argument over Labour\u2019s \u00a328bn green investment promise once and for all. Prior to the decision to ditch the pledge, Labour figures had been getting tangled up in questions about how it would be paid for and were fearing Conservative attacks on their spending plans. But having abandoned the \u00a328bn figure after weeks of uncertainty, Reeves and her team now feel they \u201ccan prosecute the economic case much more effectively\u201d, one source said. Reeves\u2019s speech showed Labour trying to get back on the front foot after a difficult few days for the party in which its poll lead has slipped slightly, and Keir Starmer has been mired in accusations that he did not act quickly enough to suspend a Labour candidate accused of spreading a conspiracy theory about Israel. The shadow chancellor appeared sure-footed in the face of questions about the Rochdale candidate furore, saying the comments had been made in a private meeting and that Labour could not know everything about what was said behind closed doors. She also batted away queries about what she would do if standing in Jeremy Hunt\u2019s shoes for the budget next month, apart from saying Labour would go for growth with planning reforms and a modern industrial strategy. The question remains about how Labour\u2019s economic offering differs from the Tories\u2019 now that the party has got rid of the \u00a328bn green investment pledge, which, while the subject of political attacks, had polled well with the public. Reeves made noises about matching Tory tax cuts, saying she had \u201cmade no secret of the fact that [she] wants taxes on working people to be lower\u201d as long as the money was there to make that possible. But with Sunak and Hunt believed to be pencilling in public spending cuts to fund tax cuts, that could put Labour in a difficult position over whether to follow suit. The shadow chancellor referred to \u201chard choices ahead\u201d, but went no further in indicating how Labour would deal with a scenario where the Tories go to the polls promising tax cuts on the back of fresh austerity."

            "date": "2024-02-16T12:00:45Z",
            "content": "Bordered by the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, Egypt is a country blessed with many miles of coastline, and its resorts have long been tourist favourites. But in a country in which the divide between rich and poor has always been stark, Egypt\u2019s recent economic woes have had a seismic effect on society \u2013 and nowhere illustrates that better than the fortunes of those making their way to the country\u2019s two coasts. Along the Red Sea\u2019s Gulf of Aqaba, the once-quiet fishing outpost of Dahab has become a haven for well-off young digital nomads. Its warm turquoise waters and hipster vibes have transformed the small town into a popular diving resort, making it the perfect location for those looking for a more flexible work-life balance. \u201cI fell in love with Dahab,\u201d says Natalia*, a Moldovan spurred into a lifestyle change by the Covid-19 pandemic and who now calls Dahab home while working on her PhD. \u201cWhen you\u2019re here, you experience a sense of harmony with nature.\u201d Tamer*, a 25-year-old from Cairo, works from Dahab as a freelance translator. \u201cLife becomes more affordable\u201d outside the capital, says Tamer, who asked for his real name not to be used as he relies on the illegal currency exchange market. \u201cSome months, I can even put money aside,\u201d he adds. The number of digital nomads rose sharply during the pandemic, when workplaces made the necessary switch to remote working and white-collar workers were suddenly released from geographical confines. In the intervening years, rising rents and the cost of living crisis in many countries have also driven out young professionals, and changing cities or even countries becomes a more affordable option. In Egypt, the exchange rate makes the country especially attractive to anyone paid in dollars or euros, which often applies to foreigners who can apply for a work permit or those natives who work with international companies. But millions of Egyptians are struggling in a stricken economy. Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, three consecutive devaluations in 2022 have halved the Egyptian pound\u2019s value. Officially, the dollar is worth about EGP30, but a severe shortage of foreign currency has revived a thriving parallel market, where the rate is up to EGP60 to the dollar. Hit by record high inflation rates of close to 30%, the living standards of most of Egypt\u2019s 105 million people dropped sharply, pushing thousands to make the dangerous journey to Europe by sea. From 2020, the Arab world\u2019s most populous country had become the ninth-highest source of asylum applications to the European Union. Meanwhile, digital nomads who are paid in dollars have found these economic circumstances ideal for enjoying year-round sunshine on its pristine beaches. \u201cThe past year has been a gamechanger,\u201d says Natalia. \u201cInternet cutoffs are now a thing of the past; several new co-working spaces opened up. \u201cEven if you encounter issues with wifi, 4G is very affordable, especially if you\u2019re paid in US dollars,\u201d she says. Ali al-Edreesy, professor of economics at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport, says: \u201cThere is no crisis without winners and losers; it\u2019s inaccurate to claim that everyone loses in a crisis.\u201d What needs to be assessed, he says, is \u201cwhether the negative impacts on a group outweigh the positive impacts on another\u201d. According to the World Bank, nearly a third of Egypt\u2019s population fell below the national poverty line in 2019, most of whom live along the overcrowded, impoverished Nile delta, with overstretched services. Edreesy says poor economic prospects have pushed more people to leave Egypt, many choosing to overlook the hurdles of illegal immigration. In November 2022, life changed for Samir*, who is not using his real name while Italian authorities process his asylum request. He had journeyed from his home in Belbes in the Nile delta province of Sharqiya, to New Alamein on Egypt\u2019s north coast to start work as a mechanic. When he got there, the 24-year-old was told there was no longera job for him. \u201cI had nowhere to go,\u201d Samir says. A friend in Italy told him that a bus of would-be migrants was leaving Alexandria for Salloum, near the Libyan border. Having seen many youths from his home town make a successful start in Italy, Samir had been contemplating the journey for a while and the phone call felt like a \u201clifeline\u201d. The bus travelled along mountain trails to avoid checkpoints on its way to Salloum. There, he paid smugglers an initial fee of EGP40,000 (about \u00a31,000) before joining a group of people, mainly women and children. \u201cWe walked to Libya. I had no other choice: I had paid a large sum of money so I was committed,\u201d says Samir. Finally, the group reached the border area between Egypt and Libya. With someone else\u2019s child in his arms, and following the smugglers\u2019 instructions, Samir sprinted several hundred metres through a minefield until he reached the barbed wire marking Libyan territory. \u201cThat\u2019s when bullets from Libya\u2019s border patrol rained on us,\u201d he says. Exhausted and terrified, Samir immediately surrendered. He and the others were arrested and taken to a nearby checkpoint, but they bribed the border guard to let them go for 1,000 Libyan dinars (about \u00a3160). After a few days in Libya, Samir met another smuggler who took him to a nearby warehouse, where illegal migrants were kept. \u201cI spent the worst 20 days of my life in that small warehouse,\u201d he says. \u201cThousands of people squashed together with little food and water. Any sort of objection to the conditions was met with violence. A man who asked for more water was thrown into a well to die.\u201d Samir was then packed into a crowded truck and dropped at the coast near the port of Tobruk, where the self-styled Libyan National Army of the warlord Khalifa Haftar, who nominally controls eastern Libya, has cracked down on people-smuggling. From there, Samir and about 700 other would-be migrants scaled a mountain to reach a point on the coast where a boat was waiting. \u201cWhen people fell off the mountain to their death, the smugglers did nothing to help,\u201d he says. \u201cHundreds of us boarded a boat barely fit for 50 people.\u201d After two sleepless days at sea, they reached the shores of Italy. Samir surrendered to the police and was housed in a specialist refugee camp. He has been there for almost a year, awaiting a decision on his refugee status. Samir is one of 21,753 Egyptians who reached Europe in 2022 \u2013 when the numbers of Egyptians arriving in Europe surpassed even those from countries devastated by war such as Syria and Afghanistan. \u201cIt\u2019s not solely economic drivers; there are also cultural aspects at play,\u201d says Ibrahim Adam, a civil society worker in Tattoun, near Faiyum, south of Cairo, where many young people are tempted to try illegal migration. \u201cThe youth here see young people who migrated illegally, living well, dressed nicely, and integrated into Italian society, and they think they could do it as well,\u201d Adam says. \u201cIt has become a sort of get-rich-quick scheme that they\u2019re falling for.\u201d Adam is affiliated to the Tattoun Community Development Association, which introduces vulnerable young people to the government-run Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency (Smeda) to look at alternative ways to make a living, and where they receive support for their project ideas and marketing, management training, as well as financial support and funding at lower interest rates. \u201cSome people respond to our work while the majority don\u2019t,\u201d says Adam. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s crucial to continue awareness efforts since it remains the only solution. For Edreesy, however, economic factors are crucial. He believes the solution lies primarily in \u201caddressing inflation and stabilising the exchange rate\u201d. He says that \u201conly then will the market begin to experience a certain level of revitalisation that would solve many of Egypt\u2019s problems\u201d. But Adam points out: \u201cEven when the dollar equated to less than 15 Egyptian pounds, young people still resorted to migration. The issue lies in the culture.\u201d * Full names have not been used to protect their identity This article is published in collaboration with Egab."

            "date": "2024-02-08T19:40:11Z",
            "content": "When Rachel Reeves announced Labour\u2019s \u00a328bn climate plan in 2021, she was so confident it was the right thing to do that she issued a dire warning about what would happen if the scheme was held up or scaled back. \u201cThe greatest cost to our public finances, as well as to our planet, will be if we delay and let the costs mount up for future generations to pay,\u201d she told a packed hall at the party conference in Brighton. On Thursday, Reeves stood alongside the party leader, Keir Starmer, in front of about 30 journalists in a draughty room in parliament and reversed all of that. The \u00a328bn was gone, as was the reasoning behind it. \u201cWe want to bring jobs to Britain, to bring energy bills down, to boost our energy security, and also to decarbonise the economy,\u201d Reeves told reporters. \u201cIf you don\u2019t need to spend \u00a328bn in doing that, that\u2019s great.\u201d The reversal of Labour\u2019s central economic and environmental policy has come after weeks of agonised decision-making by Starmer and Reeves, in conjunction with Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary. Thursday\u2019s confirmation that the policy would be cut back to half its original scale is a key moment in Starmer\u2019s leadership and could redefine the election campaign. It also marks a shift in Reeves\u2019s entire economic philosophy. No longer is the shadow chancellor arguing for public investment for its own sake as a way to stimulate the economy and galvanise private capital. Instead, she says she wants to achieve Labour\u2019s green targets using as little public money as possible. The story of how that change came about in the course of just over two years is indicative of the broader shift in approach from Starmer and Reeves in that time, as they have enacted a series of U-turns in an attempt to shed the baggage they fear could weigh them down in an election contest. From determination to doubt Reeves\u2019s initial announcement in 2021 was regarded in senior Labour circles as a triumph. The Brighton conference had been fractious until then. The party had been plagued by splits between Starmer and Miliband on the question of whether energy companies should be nationalised. Senior figures had been followed wherever they went by protesters calling for a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d. The party\u2019s members had defied the leadership by voting for a motion calling for a \u201csocialist green new deal\u201d. Reeves\u2019s announcement brought an end to all that, answering the criticisms that Labour did not have a green policy and that it did not have an economic strategy. \u201cI am committing the next Labour government to an additional \u00a328bn of capital investment in our country\u2019s green transition for each and every year of this decade,\u201d she told delegates. \u201cI will be a responsible chancellor. I will be Britain\u2019s first green chancellor.\u201d Labour stuck to the plan for many months. At the party conference a year later, Starmer announced that a significant chunk of the money would be spent on a new national energy company, to be known as Great British Energy. Other schemes included a new sovereign wealth fund to invest in green schemes and a \u00a36bn-a-year home insulation scheme to improve the energy efficiency of 19m properties. Gradually however, senior Labour figures became nervous. After Liz Truss\u2019s turbulent 45 days in power, Labour\u2019s pitch to the electors was no longer to be the party of radical change, but instead to offer reassurance where the Conservatives offered turmoil. Truss\u2019s economic plans, coupled with the war in Ukraine and rising inflation, sent interest rates on UK government debt spiking from just over 1% at the beginning of 2022 to 4.5% by the middle of 2023. Reeves was growing concerned about the economic consequences of the \u00a328bn policy, especially after a crucial meeting she had in Washington DC in June 2023 with Janet Yellen, the US treasury secretary. People briefed on that meeting have told the Guardian that Yellen warned Reeves against making the mistake the Biden administration had of announcing major new climate investments without first reforming planning laws so they could get built. Reeves came back from that trip determined to make a change. She wrote an article for the Times announcing the \u00a328bn figure would not be hit until the second half of the parliament, and that it would only be hit if Labour could meet its promise to have debt falling as a percentage of economic output at the end of a five-year period. Given the forecasts at the time predicted the government could borrow only an additional \u00a36bn a year and still have debt falling in that time period, Reeves\u2019s announcement all but killed her original policy. Decision time And yet Labour politicians continued to use the \u00a328bn figure, putting the party in the awkward position of defending a figure they had no intention of hitting and could not say how it would be spent. Shadow ministers and advisers began pitching their ideas for how to change the policy. Some wanted to junk it altogether. Others wanted to use the money to fund other investment schemes, such as new schools and roads. Some suggested putting all the existing spending commitments in a single bill and abandoning the rest. As those around Starmer argued over what should happen, the leader continued to defend it publicly. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s absolutely clear to me that the Tories are trying to weaponise this issue, the \u00a328bn,\u201d he said in January. \u201cThis is a fight I want to have \u2026 If they want that fight on borrow-to-invest, I\u2019m absolutely up for that fight.\u201d Privately however, Starmer was becoming convinced of the need to make a change. He, Reeves and Miliband began working intensively on a compromise which would protect existing schemes such as GB Energy and the sovereign wealth fund, but scale back the home insulation scheme and clarify that no further spending would be announced. Labour officials insisted on Thursday the three had developed the plan together, downplaying talk of a split at the top of the party. The final decision was reached jointly just days ago, they added. Some of Starmer\u2019s advisers urged him to wait until after Jeremy Hunt\u2019s budget to make the final decision, not least because the chancellor was promising more tax cuts which would further reduce the room to borrow. The Labour leader, however, had told shadow ministers to have their manifesto policies ready by Thursday in case of a May election, so he knew a decision would have to be taken by then. Besides, reports in the Guardian and elsewhere about the fate of the \u00a328bn were making it increasingly hard to hold the line. \u201cToday is the deadline for shadow cabinet teams to get their proposals in and fully funded so we can begin the next stage of the process of the manifesto,\u201d he told reporters on Thursday. \u201cWe knew we would have to get to a decision on this around about now.\u201d Political ramifications The eventual U-turn was met with anger among green campaigners and some MPs, including the former shadow energy secretary Barry Gardiner, who called it \u201ceconomically illiterate, environmentally irresponsible and politically jejune\u201d. And while the party has recommitted to parts of its investment schemes, important question remain. Can Labour really decarbonise Britain\u2019s energy sector by 2030 with this level of spending? What does the reduction in the home insulation programme mean for the legal requirement to eradicate fuel poverty by 2030? Many in Labour expressed relief at the change, however. \u201cAt least we know what the policy is now,\u201d said one shadow minister. \u201cAt least we have something to defend.\u201d But if Labour believes it now has something to defend, the Tories insist they still have something to attack. Senior advisers to Rishi Sunak insisted on Thursday they intended to keep using the \u00a328bn figure, arguing Labour would have to end up spending that much when they realised they might miss their green targets. \u201cNothing has changed,\u201d said one. But in a sign of how Thursday\u2019s announcement by Starmer has made life more difficult for his opponents, the Conservatives were simultaneously accusing him of enacting another \u201cflip-flop\u201d. \u201cThe problem is the Tories now have to decide,\u201d said one Labour figure. \u201cIs it that nothing has changed, or have we flip-flopped? They can\u2019t get their attack right.\u201d"

            "content": "Get ready to see more flotations later this year, said David Schwimmer, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange Group on Thursday. Good: it would mark a change from the droughts of 2022 and 2023 that have caused much agonising over the health of the London stock market. But, actually, the deep problem here may not be a shortage of newcomers. Rather, it could be indifference, or so it seems, towards sub-\u00a31bn UK companies that have been around for years. The current extraordinary bid battle for Chippenham-based Wincanton, the last UK-listed logistics firm, shows how the London market \u2013 or part of it \u2013 sometimes doesn\u2019t know how to value what it\u2019s got. A bid at a 52% premium to the previous share price would normally be regarded as juicy if it came at the end of a contested tussle, but Wincanton got that on one day when a French shipping firm, CMA CGM, offered 450p-a-share, or \u00a3567m, last month. Some Wincanton shareholders felt the offer was still too mean (well done, Aberforth), so the French went to 480p to try to clinch things. But now comes a fresh suitor from the US, GXO Logistics, offering 605p. That is 104% more than the old share price of 297p, which shouldn\u2019t happen if a market is liquid and full of active buyers and sellers. We\u2019re not talking about a hard-to-value biotech outfit. Wincanton, with 20,000 employees, is in the business of warehouses and lorries. Yes, there have been a couple of complications in recent years \u2013 the loss of a contract with HMRC to check cross-border goods and a deficit in the pension fund (now resolved) \u2013 but neither should have scrambled the market\u2019s collective brain. Wincanton\u2019s chairman, Sir Martin Read, understandably backed the original French offer on the grounds that the company\u2019s strong financial performance had \u201cnot been reflected in the performance of its shares in recent years\u201d. If Wincanton was an isolated case, one could shrug and say pockets of undervaluation can occur in any market. But, over at Currys, the electrical retailer, a similar tale is unfolding. From a previous 47p, the bids from US hedge fund Elliott have reached 67p per share, an improvement of 42%, and the defending board is still resisting \u2013 quite rightly, many of us would argue (Peel Hunt\u2019s analyst reckons 80p is the point at which Currys would be obliged to engage). Currys\u2019 largest shareholder, Redwheel, which has backed the board, made an excellent point when it said there was a wider problem with a UK equity market \u201cwhich no longer seems to fulfil its primary purpose of price discovery and efficient capital allocation\u201d. Fund manager Ian Lance pointed to the silliness of some big UK investment houses allocating cash away from UK equities, which are close to all-time low valuations, and towards US equities at close to all-time highs. \u201cUnless this changes, it seems likely that we will continue to see overseas corporate buyers step in to take advantage of the depressed valuations of UK equities with ownership falling into foreign hands and the number of quoted UK businesses will continue to decline,\u201d he argued. It\u2019s hard to disagree. A pitch for London is not compelling if it involves paying your advisers a small fortune to get listed and then being ignored for years until a foreign predator turns up. In a rational world, perceived undervaluations would bring forth buyers and the problem would solve itself. Maybe the sight of a 100% takeover premium will help at the margin. But investor indifference towards pockets of small- and medium-sized companies is not new and none of the proposed remedies sounds transformational. Obliging UK pension funds to show more home bias in their equity portfolios would help, but compulsion has its limits. The proposal for a \u201cBritish ISA\u201d, with allocations only to UK-listed stocks, probably wouldn\u2019t shift serious sums. Consolidation among defined-benefit schemes, to produce bigger funds with an appetite to own more UK equities, will not happen overnight. If Schwimmer has more radical ideas, we\u2019d love to hear them. Sadly, he seems more interested in arguing that people such as himself \u2013 those running large FTSE 100 companies \u2013 should be paid more to compete with US rivals. That won\u2019t cure the problems at the other end of the market."

            "date": "2024-02-22T23:10:33Z",
            "content": "Reddit set the stage for its highly anticipated stock market debut, preparing investors for the largest initial public offering by a major social network in four years. A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday disclosed the financial performance of the social media group, and revealed that Sam Altman, the OpenAI founder and CEO, is its third-largest shareholder, with an 8.7% stake. The company plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \u201cRDDT.\u201d Its much-awaited listing \u2013 expected in March \u2013 would be the biggest social media IPO since Pinterest went public in 2019. The number of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined, Reddit said in a statement. The IPO filing revealed that Reddit sustained $90.8m in losses in 2023, down from $158.6m in 2022, as its revenue grew by roughly 21%. The platform has 267.5 million active weekly users, more than 100,000 active communities, and 1bn total posts, it said. The business estimated that its US average revenue per user, or ARPU, was $3.42 for the last quarter of 2023 \u2013 a decrease of 2% year over year. Advance Magazine Publishers is the company\u2019s largest shareholder, with a 30.1% stake, while the Chinese multinational Tencent has 11%. Reddit\u2019s planned IPO comes almost two decades after Reddit\u2019s launch and will be a major test for the platform that still lags the commercial success of social media contemporaries such as Facebook and Twitter, now known as X. The filing also revealed an unusual plan from Reddit to allow its most active users to buy shares in the IPO. Reddit will allocate shares using a tiered system rewarding users who have \u201cmeaningfully contributed to Reddit community programs\u201d, users who have completed a certain number of moderator actions and people with a minimum \u201ckarma\u201d score \u2013 the points given to users by others on the platform for posting content. Reddit was valued at $10bn in a funding round in 2021 and it is unclear what valuation the company will aim for during its share sale in the coming weeks. It is expected to seek a sale of nearly 10% of its shares in the IPO, Reuters reported earlier. In the filing, Reddit cited data licensing arrangements as a revenue stream \u2013 saying that in January 2024 it entered data licensing arrangements with an aggregate contract value of $203m. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Reddit struck a deal with Alphabet\u2019s Google to make its content available to train the search engine giant\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) models. The contract is worth about $60m each year, according to one of the sources. \u201cReddit data constantly grows and regenerates as users come and interact with their communities and each other,\u201d Reddit said in its filing. \u201cWe believe our growing platform data will be a key element in the training of leading large language models (\u201cLLMs\u201d) and serve as an additional monetization channel for Reddit.\u201d Reddit had confidentially filed for the IPO in late 2021, but tough economic conditions and the poor performance of listed technology stocks had compelled it to delay the offering. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have been tapped as the lead underwriters for Reddit\u2019s IPO, which includes more than a dozen other banks."

            "title": "Why has Nvidia driven stock markets to record highs?",
            "date": "2024-02-23T16:39:35Z",
            "content": "Investor excitement over artificial intelligence reached a new peak this week when better-than-expected results from chipmaker Nvidia drove stock markets in three continents to record highs. The rally began on Thursday and continued into Friday, as Nvidia overtook Google\u2019s parent group, Alphabet, to become the third most valuable company in the US. Its market capitalisation hit $2tn (\u00a31.58tn), surpassed only by Microsoft and Apple. The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has raised many questions, not least over safety and the impact on jobs, but there are also concerns that it might be driving unsustainable market exuberance. Here we look at the latest share price rise and whether it can be maintained. What does Nvidia do and why is it important to AI? Nvidia makes the chips that are crucial to training and operating AI systems \u2013 they can carry out the immense data crunching required for tools like chatbots very quickly \u2013 and the demand for this crucial infrastructure is soaring as big tech firms join the AI race and make products such as ChatGPT that people want to use. If Nvidia is reporting strong demand for its products, then it is a clear sign that demand for the technology is thriving \u2013 and investors will inevitably follow. On Wednesday, the US-based firm surprised markets with the strength of its fourth-quarter earnings. It posted revenues of $22.1bn \u2013 against expectations of $20.6bn \u2013 and then forecast revenue growth of 233% in the current quarter, ahead of Wall Street forecasts of 208%. Nvidia\u2019s chief executive Jensen Huang said demand for generative AI \u2013 technology that immediately produces convincing text, images and audio from simple typed prompts \u2013 had reached a \u201ctipping point\u201d. How did markets react? Several leading indices have started the year strongly and reached fresh highs after the Nvidia results. On Thursday, Japan\u2019s main stock market index, the Nikkei, increased 2.19% to close at 39,098.68 in Tokyo \u2013 the highest it has been in 34 years. Over the longer term, other factors have boosted the Nikkei, including capital fleeing troubled waters in China and a fall in the value of the yen, but Nvidia\u2019s results had a knock-on effect around the world. Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 and Wall Street\u2019s blue chip Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 indices all reached new highs. Nvidia was a big beneficiary too, of course, posting the biggest ever single-day increase in the value of a listed company as its worth rose by $277bn. One investment argument is that strong demand for Nvidia GPUs \u2013 or graphics processing units, the company\u2019s key AI-friendly product \u2013 will ripple out across economies as demand for AI-related infrastructure and services increases. \u201cNvidia and the golden GPUs are the start of the spending wave, not the end and now Wall Street awaits as a myriad of use cases get built out across the enterprise and consumer ecosystem,\u201d said Dan Ives, analyst at US financial firm Wedbush Securities. For instance, tech research firm Gartner forecasts that global spending on AI software will grow from $124bn in 2022 to $297bn in 2027. There is also a belief that AI will increase productivity, or produce higher economic growth at a lower cost, with the accompanying fear that those lower costs are due to fewer jobs as AI systems render human roles obsolete. According to Goldman Sachs, generative AI could boost US GDP by 0.4 percentage points and by 0.3 points in other developed markets over the next 10 years. How much is AI behind the stock market increases? It has played a significant role in continuing to boost the big tech stocks, which play such an outsize role in US markets alone. This week Deutsche Bank pointed out that tech stocks were playing an ever-bigger role in the S&amp;P 500, the biggest US index. The bank pointed out that Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Amazon and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, account for almost a quarter of the value of the S&amp;P 500. \u201cThe US equity market is rivalling 2000 and 1929 in terms of being its most concentrated in history,\u201d wrote Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank\u2019s head of global economics and thematic research. Once you add in the other two big US tech stocks \u2013 Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta and Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla \u2013 you get the so-called \u201cMag 7\u201d \u2013 a reference to the Magnificent Seven movie \u2013 who together have a combined market cap of over $13tn, a bigger valuation than all the stocks listed in any other single country, other than the US. All of Mag 7 have interests in AI to varying degrees. For instance, Amazon and Microsoft own cloud computing businesses that are crucial to developing and operating AI models (Microsoft is also a big investor in ChatGPT developer OpenAI), while Apple\u2019s shares were boosted recently by a bank report predicting new AI features embedded in its phones will increase demand. Is the AI stock market boom sustainable? The excitement around AI breakthroughs continues, with OpenAI revealing the remarkable-looking Sora video generation tool last week and Google releasing an upgrade to its Gemini model. Nvidia\u2019s optimistic sales forecasts also indicate an ongoing increase in demand for AI-related infrastructure. Deutsche Bank\u2019s Reid states that there are arguments \u201cfor and against\u201d the continued dominance of the Mag 7. In their favour, he argues that AI is \u201cjust in its infancy\u201d and the companies have room to grow due to their global reach. Factors against them include regulators launching antitrust actions and no one really knowing how AI will pan out and who will win. Neil Wilson, chief analyst at brokerage firm Finalto, says this is a bubble \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s the nature of markets, it\u2019s built into them to produce these manias\u201d \u2013 and the question is when and how it levels off. \u201cDoes the levelling off see a bust phase or can it glide gently down, which stocks are overvalued now and which are not, and I guess crucially from the wider perspective, does it herald a new era of productivity boom which sees multiples expand for almost all equities?\u201d Are there broader economic factors at play in the stock market rise? Stock markets have rallied in recent weeks, reflecting an easing of tensions that not so long ago appeared ready to wreck a global economic recovery. The Gaza conflict is a humanitarian disaster, but for the time being, ships laden with oil and gas are reaching their destinations, allowing the oil price to stabilise and the gas price to tumble back towards pre-pandemic levels. Low and stable energy prices are the bedrock of any recovery along with low interest rates, and central banks have signalled they will begin to make cuts in the second half of this year after a steep fall in inflation. Even Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock market \u2013 held back for decades by low growth while the country coped with an ageing population \u2013 joined New York\u2019s S&amp;P 500 and German DAX indexes in reaching a record high. What could bring the rally to a halt? The conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East could escalate further, sparking a resurgence of shortages of energy, food and raw materials. The result will be a return to high inflation, which again could dent spending and confidence. Even without a global downturn, stock market investors may panic if they believe financial assets have become overpriced. It has been 16 years since the great financial crash of 2008, and many economists believe that the best efforts of regulators to prevent excessive speculation across the board during that time will not be enough to prevent another 2008-style wipeout."

            "date": "2024-02-09T07:44:58Z",
            "content": "The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has hinted at plans to launch a tax-free \u201cBritish Isa\u201d investing in UK company shares at the spring budget, as part of efforts to revive the country\u2019s stock market. A British stock Isa would allow investors to buy a certain amount of UK company shares, without paying tax. Currently, the government charges a 0.5% tax, known as the share purchase stamp duty, for any shares bought in the UK. It comes as Hunt tries to find cost-free announcements that could help win over voters and businesses as the Tories lag well behind Labour in the polls before a much-anticipated general election. The incentive, which some expected Hunt to announce as part of the autumn statement last November, could also complement government plans to sell shares in NatWest \u2013 which is still 38.6% government owned since its 2008 taxpayer bailout \u2013 to retail investors later this year. Hunt made the comments in front of hundreds of City bosses, who were gathered in the Raffles hotel in Westminster for an annual dinner hosted by the financial services lobby group TheCityUK. When asked whether he would consider a British Isa, he said: \u201cSo there\u2019s a certain category of questions that I\u2019m not really able to answer \u2026 Those are things that might appear in the budget. And that is one of them.\u201d \u201cDo I want to do things that mean that more UK capital is invested in our most promising companies? Absolutely. I think that something like a British Isa could be very good at that.\u201d It comes as the City faces growing threats from rival financial hubs including New York, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam, particularly post-Brexit. London\u2019s stock market has experienced an exodus of companies chasing capital outside the UK, with Flutter Entertainment, the owner of Paddy Power, Betfair and FanDuel, saying last week that it was considering moving its primary listing to New York \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d. However, Hunt stopped short of suggesting he was ready to slash the 0.5% stamp duty levied on direct share purchases, which some City campaigners have claimed is a larger roadblock for local investors. Both proposals \u2013 the British stock Isa and the scrapping of stock stamp duty \u2013 have been lobbied for by City groups, including the industry body UK Finance. UK Finance\u2019s spring budget submission paper, released earlier this week, said: \u201cWhile the reforms in autumn statement 2023 to evolve the Isa regime were welcome, officials need to work with providers to ensure these changes can be properly implemented. The government should explore introducing a \u2018British Isa\u2019 focused on UK domestic equities to offer an easily accessible, trusted vehicle to incentivise investment in UK equities for individuals.\u201d Hunt also reiterated ambitions to make the UK the next Silicon Valley, unleashing growth akin to the big bang changes to City regulations that some credit with unleashing a boom in British financial services. That would extend to a boost in tech-focused stock market listings. \u201cWe want the London Stock Exchange to become Europe\u2019s Nasdaq,\u201d he said."

            "content": "Japan\u2019s main stock index, European shares and Wall Street\u2019s blue-chip listings hit all-time highs on Thursday as strong results from the chipmaker Nvidia stoked investor exuberance over a worldwide artificial intelligence investment boom. The S&amp;P 500 enjoyed its best day in more than a year in New York, rising 2.1% amid a global equities rally. The technology-heavy Nasdaq gained 3%. Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average, which climbed 1.2%, scaled fresh all-time highs. The Nasdaq finished just shy of its own record. Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 index also reached a record close of 495.10. Earlier in the day, the Nikkei increased 2.19% to close at 39,098.68 in Tokyo. On the final trading day of 1989, it had closed at 38,915.87. The 34 years it has taken to regain its footing is a decade longer than it took Wall Street to recoup losses from the 1929 crash and Great Depression. Shares in Nvidia leapt 16.4% as trading started a day after the company reported bullish results. Booming demand for its AI chips \u2013 a key piece of infrastructure for companies building and operating AI tools \u2013 helped Nvidia post quarterly revenue and future sales guidance much above Wall Street\u2019s already high expectations on Wednesday, lifting tech stocks globally. The gains meant Nvidia broke the record for the biggest single-day increase in a company\u2019s stock market value, as it added $277bn to be worth more than $1.9tn \u2013 just nine months after reaching $1tn. Although the strong Nvidia results and accompanying optimism about tech stocks helped drive the Nikkei to a record high, the Tokyo index has been bolstered over the past few years by other factors, including hope that Japan is finally overcoming its historical problems with flat or falling prices, and investor concerns about the Chinese economy. A fall in the value of the yen has also helped to tempt foreign investors to the Nikkei. One analyst described Nvidia\u2019s results on Wednesday as \u201cthe biggest moment for the market and tech sector in many years\u201d. \u201cThis was a \u2018game-changing moment\u2019 for the tech bulls and puts jet fuel in the tech bull market thesis,\u201d said Dan Ives, an analyst at the US financial firm Wedbush Securities. Jensen Huang, the Nvidia chief executive, said on Wednesday the AI market had hit \u201cthe tipping point\u201d. He added: \u201cDemand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\u201d Gains in Nvidia lifted its AI competitor Advanced Micro Devices by 10.7%, while Super Micro Computer climbed 33% and the UK-based Arm Holdings rose 4%. Soaring demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips used by companies rushing to upgrade their AI offerings helped the Silicon Valley company forecast first-quarter revenue growth of 233%, ahead of Wall Street expectations of 208%. The midpoint of the forecast was $24bn, which was above market expectations of about $22.2bn. Fourth quarter revenues were $22.1bn against an expected $20.6bn \u2013 up 265% from a year ago. Josh Gilbert, a market analyst at eToro, said: \u201cNvidia continues to deliver in every way, and its results show there is still plenty of growth ahead. This isn\u2019t just a flash in the pan, nor a bubble, but a business that continues to make serious cash.\u201d Expectations heading into the results were very high, with shares in Nvidia surging nearly 36% this year to become the best-performing S&amp;P 500 stock and notching a record high just last week. The share rise that fuelled the S&amp;P 500\u2019s climb to record highs this year had prompted fears that growth at Nvidia, seen as the bellwether for AI demand, could disappoint and potentially disrupt the market rally."

            "title": "Why insurance premiums are squeezing Australians and fuelling inflation",
            "date": "2024-02-27T04:44:04Z",
            "content": "Insurance premiums are rising faster than inflation, squeezing homeowners, drivers and private health customers, even as some of Australia\u2019s biggest insurers expand their profits. The sector, largely overlooked as a driver of inflation and cause of cost-of-living pressures, was the standout contributor to the most recent inflation data, representing annual price increases not seen in more than two decades. Insurers have been advising customers of double-digit premium price increases for most products, including home cover and car insurance, representing a new super cycle of hikes. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The industry has defended the decisions, arguing that extreme weather and high costs of labour, building replacement, car parts and repairs mean above-inflation increases are necessary. Climate crisis effects are weighing heavily on prices charged by reinsurers, which take on some of the risk of natural disasters, ultimately passed to policyholders. Prof Paula Jarzabkowski from the University of Queensland said the increased frequency of extreme weather events was driving prices higher. \u201cYou usually get a spike in premiums for a year or two after a disaster and then it all settles back down again,\u201d said Jarzabkowski, who specialises in addressing insurance protection gaps. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is a fundamental change in the way the insurance market works. \u201cYou\u2019re going to find that some people simply can\u2019t afford insurance and so they will drop out of the market. We\u2019ve built in places we probably shouldn\u2019t have built in and, after climate change, they\u2019re definitely not robust.\u201d While weather disasters are fuelling insurance premium hikes, brokers also note that the steep increases have put insurers in a strong position to profit in the years ahead, a scenario that resembles what occurred in the aftermath of the 2010-11 Queensland floods. Two of the country\u2019s biggest general insurers, Suncorp and QBE, unveiled greatly expanded insurance profit margins at their recent financial results, with the former attributing the spike to strong premium growth, an increase in customer numbers and targeted price increases. \u201cWe remain acutely alert to the affordability challenges facing customers and continue to focus on driving greater efficiencies in our own business,\u201d Suncorp said. QBE noted that higher costs for building products and the greater frequency and severity of weather events were reflected in policy pricing. The sharemarket performance of insurance stocks is mixed, as old claims weigh on the performance of some of the country\u2019s biggest insurers, such as IAG, while Suncorp and QBE are trading near decade highs. Insurers have not faced the same sort of political scrutiny as supermarkets and banks, which have also profited during the inflationary period while their customers grapple with increased prices and repayments. The Australian Council of Trade Unions said the major insurers had shown \u201cno mercy\u201d in a cost-of-living crisis. \u201cWhen you see the growth in these profits, workers should rightly ask why they are getting priced out of essential cover,\u201d ACTU assistant secretary Joseph Mitchell said. The insurance sector\u2019s future profitability will depend on whether they face ongoing elevated claims or if they enjoy a period of relative peace. There\u2019s also a question over whether customers will continue to accept double-digit price increases on their policies. Insurance prices are up 16.2% over 12 months, according to the inflation reading, representing the highest annual rate since 2001. This compares with a 4.1% annual inflation rate, which policymakers are trying to push back down to the 2% to 3% band. A spokesperson from the Insurance Council of Australia said that since the devastating bushfires of 2019-20, insurers have paid out $16bn in claims from 13 declared insurance catastrophes or significant events, which are still affecting premiums. \u201cWherever you live in Australia, whether you\u2019re directly exposed to extreme weather impacts or not, premium prices are rising because of the escalating costs of natural disasters, the growing value of our assets making them more costly to replace, inflation driving up building and vehicle repair costs, and the increasing cost of capital for insurers,\u201d the spokesperson said. Insurance costs contribute more than 5% to inflation calculations, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, behind housing and food but ahead of education and clothing expenses. Kate Booth from the University of Tasmania said there needed to be more awareness of how rising premiums were adding to cost-of-living pressures. \u201cCompanies that produce food, their insurance risk profiles are changing, so they\u2019re potentially paying extra for their insurance and then that has a flow-on effect to consumers,\u201d Booth said, referring to the impact of climate change on premiums. \u201cIt\u2019s not just housing contents insurance. That\u2019s the most obvious thing that we can really see and get a tangible grasp of, but potentially all kinds of insurance are increasing in price \u2013 health insurance, pet insurance, funeral insurance, life insurance.\u201d Health costs are also tracking above inflation, according to ABS data, at the same time as the value many consumers receive from the private health insurance diminishes, according to a report by the Australian Medical Association. The industry group Private Healthcare Australia has rejected claims of declining value and said health funds had been paying more on average for hospital treatment per policyholder compared with past years. Australia\u2019s largest private health insurer, Medibank, increased its profit margins throughout the pandemic, rising from 7.2% in 2019-20 to 9.1% last financial year, and its shares are trading near record highs. Medibank credited productivity improvements and cost savings for its expanded margins. \u201cThis cost discipline is a good thing for customers and their premiums,\u201d said Medibank\u2019s chief customer officer, Milosh Milisavljevic. \u201cWe are really focused on making sure our customers can get great value with us \u2013 and we know value starts with their premiums, which is why we\u2019ve been working hard keep to them as low as possible, despite costs rising significantly in the health sector.\u201d"

            "content": "Inflation was hotter than expected across the US last month as it continues to fall back from its highest levels in a generation. Price growth dropped to an annual rate of 3.1% in January, according to official data; above economists\u2019 expectations of 2.9%. In December, the consumer price index stood at 3.4%. The latest official data sparked a sell-off on Wall Street, with the S&amp;P 500 falling 1.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 1.1%. Stock markets have scaled record highs in recent weeks as investors grew more confident about the easing of inflation and some of the US\u2019s largest companies released robust results. While inflation has fallen sharply since peaking above 9% in June 2022, many Americans are still feeling the pinch. Joe Biden, who is standing for re-election in November, must persuade them that the economy is working for them. On a monthly basis, the consumer price index rose by 0.3% in January, up from 0.2% the previous month and also higher than the 0.2% expected. The so-called \u201ccore\u201d index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is closely watched as it tends to provide a better indication of inflation\u2019s trajectory. It also increased on the month, from 0.3% to 0.4%. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics, which releases the data each month, said the index was driven higher in January by the rising cost of shelter, including rent; motor vehicle insurance; and medical care. The US economy has remained robust in recent years, adding millions of jobs and defying predictions of recession even as the Federal Reserve has embarked upon an aggressive campaign to take on inflation. Employers added 353,000 jobs last month alone. Many Americans have not been feeling positive about the economy, as they grapple with their own financial realities. A closely watched survey by the University of Michigan indicated a rallying in consumer confidence last month, however, with sentiment jumping to its highest level since July 2021. Now that annual inflation is easing back towards 2%, Fed policymakers are preparing to cut interest rates for the first time in four years. Wall Street had been betting that the central bank would start doing so as soon as May, after the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, signaled that a cut was unlikely next month. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said January\u2019s unexpectedly strong reading will reinforce the view in some quarters that the \u201clast mile is the hardest\u201d as inflation comes back down to earth. Prices in key categories like clothing and medical care commodities did fall last month, however. \u201cThere is still plenty of disinflation in the economy,\u201d Ashworth noted."

            "date": "2024-02-05T10:03:15Z",
            "content": "Central banks should be certain they have beaten inflation before cutting interest rates this year, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said despite revisions to its outlook that showed inflation was falling at a faster rate than previously expected. The Paris-based organisation, which represents 38 countries, said it was \u201ctoo soon to be sure that underlying price pressures are fully contained\u201d. It warned that inflation in the UK would persist at the highest level in the G7 this year, forecasting a rate of 2.8%, despite sharp declines in the headline rate in recent months amid cooling global energy prices. The US inflation rate in 2024 would be 2.2%, down from a previous forecast of 2.8%. \u201cMonetary policy needs to remain prudent, that is restrictive, for some time to come to ensure inflationary pressures are contained,\u201d said Mathias Cormann, the secretary general of the OECD. However, in a shot across the bows of central banks considering early cuts in the cost of borrowing, it said that while wage demands had \u201cbecome better balanced\u201d, pay rises \u201cgenerally remain above rates compatible with medium-term inflation objectives\u201d. The attacks in the Red Sea, which have disrupted shipping through the Suez Canal, could also trigger a second round of inflationary pressure, it said. Cormann said continued disruption could add 0.4 percentage points to inflation across the OECD area this year if a doubling in shipping costs was sustained, while there were also risks to inflation from robust growth in workers\u2019 pay, corporate profits or weaker productivity growth. \u201cA widening or escalating of the conflict in the Middle East could lead to renewed price pressures and shortages, and a decline in global growth,\u201d he added. The head of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, said over the weekend that the central bank was alert to the risk of cutting interest rates too soon. \u201cThe danger of moving too soon is that the job\u2019s not quite done, and that the really good readings we\u2019ve had for the last six months somehow turn out not to be a true indicator of where inflation\u2019s heading,\u201d he told the 60 Minutes programme on CBS. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. But the prudent thing to do is to just give it some time and see that the data continue to confirm that inflation is moving down to 2% in a sustainable way.\u201d Last week, the Bank of England also played down the likelihood of an early cut to interest rates. Financial markets still expect Threadneedle Street to push down the interest rate of 5.25% in the UK towards 4% by the end of the year, but Andrew Bailey, the governor, threw cold water on a more aggressive stance, saying: \u201cWe need to see more evidence that inflation is set to fall all the way to the 2% target, and stay there, before we can lower interest rates.\u201d The OECD said growth in the global economy was likely to ease to 2.9% in 2024, from 3.1% in 2023, before recovering to 3% in 2025. Strong US growth will be higher than forecast at 2.1% in 2024. The eurozone will act as a counterweight to the US after its growth rate was downgraded from 0.9% in 2024, at the time of November\u2019s forecast, to 0.6%. The UK\u2019s growth rate for this year was left unchanged at 0.7% and is still expected to recover to 1.2% in 2025. China is expected to be a significant barrier to global growth as it struggles to cope with high levels of corporate debt and a weak property market, the OECD said. It said the estimate for China\u2019s GDP growth, which was 5.2% in 2023, was 4.7% this year before dropping to 4.2% in 2025."

            "date": "2024-02-27T00:01:07Z",
            "content": "Tumbling energy costs and a price war between Britain\u2019s supermarkets have slowed food inflation to its lowest rate for nearly two years in a boost for households trying to cope on stretched budgets. The cost of meat, fish and fruit dipped in February, meaning food prices rose 5% on last year, down from 6.1% in January and the lowest since May 2022, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC) shop price index. Although the figures show prices are still rising, the rate is far lower than the double-digit increases consumers have consistently faced since rising energy prices triggered rampant inflation over the past two years. The index showed food prices fell 0.1% in February on the previous month, its first monthly fall since last September. \u201cThis was driven by easing input costs for energy and fertiliser while retailers competed fiercely to keep prices down,\u201d said Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC. A sharp fall in the wholesale price of gas has fed through into household energy bills, with the industry regulator Ofgem announcing last week that its price cap will fall 12%, or \u00a3238 to \u00a31,690, from April. Meanwhile, there are increasing signs the major supermarkets are ramping up efforts to compete on price. The cost of living crisis has weighed on retailers\u2019 attempts to maintain their profit margins while attracting customers tackling increases in household bills and shopping budgets. Last week, Morrisons launched a campaign to tell customers it offers the same or cheaper prices than discounters Aldi and Lidl, echoing similar marketing drives by Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s. Overall, shop price inflation eased to 2.5% in February, from 2.9% in January. Nonfood prices rose, up 1.3% on a year earlier and 0.7% on January. Richard Walker, the executive chair of frozen food chain Iceland, said a cost squeeze in its supply chain had eased and it had seen \u201cstrong sales\u201d after cutting prices, including on pizzas, beef burgers and ready meals. \u201cCost pressures throughout manufacturing are coming down and this is starting to come through,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe are passing on the biggest falls faster than wholesale prices are coming down for us to get ahead of the game. For our customers, offering great value is more important than ever.\u201d The BRC figures showed the price of furniture, electricals, and health and beauty products rose, but clothing fell as retailers attempted to lure shoppers with promotions. Dickinson said that easing inflation was \u201cgood news\u201d for shoppers, but warned that the increase in shipping costs due to disruption in the Red Sea could push up the cost of non-food items, and reiterated calls for government help on retailers\u2019 business rates bills ahead of next month\u2019s budget. Separate data from the CBI showed retail sales in the year to February fell at a modest pace after a sharp drop last month. Its quarterly survey predicted the rate at which sales would fall will accelerate next month."

            "date": "2024-02-15T14:32:06Z",
            "content": "The UK economy fell into recession at the end of last year as hard-pressed households cut back on spending amid the cost of living crisis, in a heavy blow to Rishi Sunak\u2019s promise to kickstart growth. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product (GDP) fell by a larger than expected 0.3% in the three months to December after a decline in all main sectors of the economy and collapse in retail sales in the run-up to Christmas. It followed a drop of 0.1% in the third quarter, confirming a second consecutive quarter of falling national output \u2013 the technical definition of a recession. Official confirmation of a recession will embarrass the prime minister before a general election expected this year, having made growing the economy one of his five flagship priorities for government. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said Sunak\u2019s promise was \u201cin tatters\u201d after years of economic stagnation under the Conservatives. \u201cThis is Rishi Sunak\u2019s recession, and the news will be deeply worrying for families and business across Britain,\u201d she said. The ONS said growth over the course of 2023 as a whole was estimated at 0.1%, the weakest year since 2009 during the financial crisis, excluding the economic collapse in 2020 during the Covid pandemic. Highlighting a deep economic malaise as households come under pressure from soaraway prices and higher borrowing costs, official figures show economic growth per head of the population shrank for seven consecutive quarters, the worst performance since modern records began in 1955. The director of economic statistics at the ONS, Liz McKeown, said: \u201cOur initial estimate shows the UK economy contracted in the fourth quarter of 2023. While it has now shrunk for two consecutive quarters, across 2023 as a whole the economy has been broadly flat. \u201cAll the main sectors fell on the quarter, with manufacturing, construction and wholesale being the biggest drags on growth, partially offset by increases in hotels and rentals of vehicles and machinery.\u201d Economists had widely expected a shallow recession at the end of last year as households came under pressure from higher borrowing costs and rising prices for everyday essentials, forcing cuts elsewhere. Widespread strikes across the economy and heavy rainfall also dampened activity. More recent snapshots from the economy have, however, shown a rebound in consumer confidence since the start of this year, buoyed up by the prospect of interest rate cuts from the Bank of England as inflationary pressures cool. Andrew Bailey, the Bank\u2019s governor, this week downplayed the significance of the quarterly GDP figures, suggesting there were signs of an upturn in the economy that would become clearer in the months ahead. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cHigh inflation is the single biggest barrier to growth, which is why halving it has been our top priority. While interest rates are high \u2013 so the Bank of England can bring inflation down \u2013 low growth is not a surprise. \u201cBut there are signs the British economy is turning a corner. Forecasters agree that growth will strengthen over the next few years, wages are rising faster than prices, mortgage rates are down and unemployment remains low. Although times are still tough for many families, we must stick to the plan \u2013 cutting taxes on work and business to build a stronger economy.\u201d The Bank is widely expected to begin cutting interest rates from as early as this summer amid growing concern over the strength of the economy after 14 consecutive increases in the cost of borrowing in response to soaring inflation. Official figures this week show inflation unexpectedly remained unchanged at 4% in January, having fallen back from more than 10% a year ago. Economic growth is forecast to outpace France and Germany this year, at 0.7%, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, but significantly trailing the US and several other advanced economies. The ONS said since the UK economy was about 1% larger than its pre-pandemic level, ahead of Germany, but behind every other country in the G7 group of leading developed countries. The latest snapshot from the ONS indicated weakness across much of the economy at the end of last year, with a fall in GDP amid a tough Christmas shopping period for retailers. Reflecting on pressure on household spending amid the cost of living crisis, the ONS said output in the UK\u2019s dominant services sector had fallen for three consecutive quarters, with a drop of 0.2% in the last three months of 2023. Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: \u201cThough the shallowness of this recession provides comfort, these figures also confirm that our economy remained locked in a cycle of persistent stagnation throughout 2023 as a myriad of headwinds, including high inflation, weighed heavily on activity.\u201d"

            "content": "In the end it wasn\u2019t really that close. The UK economy is now technically in recession after contracting by 0.3% in the final three months of 2023. The official data brings to an end a miserable year for the UK. Growth in 2023 as a whole was just 0.1% \u2013 the weakest performance outside the Covid pandemic year of 2020 since 2009. In one sense, there is no comparison between 2009 and 2023. The former was a severe recession, with output declining by about 6% over a protracted period. In 2023 the economy had essentially stagnated: growing by 0.2% in the first quarter, remaining unchanged in the second quarter and then shrinking slightly in the second half of the year. That said, even a technical recession is a headache for Rishi Sunak, who made growing the economy one of his five new-year pledges at the start of 2023. As the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was quick to point out, the prime minister has failed to deliver on that promise. What\u2019s more, the economy showed across-the-board weakness in the fourth quarter, with all three main sectors \u2013 services, manufacturing and construction \u2013 going backwards. There was also evidence that households had been cutting back on their spending as a result of cost of living pressures and the squeeze from higher interest rates. Consumer-facing services fell by 0.7% in the final three months of the year, largely as a result of people spending less in the shops and going out in the run-up to Christmas. Governments facing the prospect of a general election always want to generate a feelgood factor before polling day. Britain, in the last three months of 2023, had the opposite: a feel-bad factor. The picture would have been even worse had it not been for a rising population. Gross domestic product per head of population has not risen for seven straight quarters (six falls, one quarter unchanged) stretching back to early 2022. Jeremy Hunt put a brave face on what was clearly unwelcome news for a government facing two byelections on Thursday. The economy was \u201cturning a corner\u201d, the chancellor said, and forecasters were predicting stronger growth over the coming years. Hunt may well be right. The worst for the economy is now probably over. Business and consumer confidence are picking up a bit. The housing market is showing signs of stabilising. The City is expecting the Bank of England to start cutting interest rates by the middle of the year. Ultimately, it makes little difference whether the economy is moving sideways or contracting marginally, particularly since revisions in the future may well show the UK was not in recession after all. But it would have certainly been politically helpful to Sunak and Hunt had the UK emulated the eurozone and narrowly avoided a recession in late 2023. The fact that it did not puts added pressure on the chancellor to come up with some \u201cfeel better\u201d measures in the budget on 6 March."

According to a new study, France is suffering from \u201can unprecedented decline\u201d in sexual activity. How steep is the decline? A cool 24% of French adults aged 18-69 said they had not had sex in the previous 12 months. In 2006 that figure was just 9%. \u00c7a alors! The decline is steeper still among the young: between the ages of 18 and 24 the proportion of celibates was 28%, up from 5% in 2006. Why have they gone off it? According to the French Institute of Public Opinion (IFOP) \u2013 which conducted the poll from a sample of 1,911 people \u2013 it could just be a form of social correction. \u201cWhat one generation does intensely, the next does less,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Kraus, IFOP\u2019s director. That\u2019s no explanation. There\u2019s also a suggestion that the French have escaped a cultural expectation to be sexually active. Women in particular now feel free to say non. So it\u2019s just a French thing? Also non. The number of cases of decreased sexual desire reported to the Spanish National Health System went up almost tenfold between 2011 and 2018. Other research has shown declines in Germany and the Netherlands in recent years. Thank God for Brexit. The frequency of sex has also been decreasing steadily in the UK for decades. Are there no benefits to leaving the EU? This is an international problem: similar declines have been reported in the US, Japan and Australia. It\u2019s probably due to increased stress, heavier workloads and the competing distractions of technology. \u201cDistractions of technology\u201d: you mean pornography? \u201cThe internet provides new mediums of sexual experience that shift away from physical, partnered experiences,\u201d the study says.

Andrew Bailey rejected accusations that Threadneedle Street\u2019s reluctance to cut borrowing costs despite falling inflation meant it was \u201cbehind the curve\u201d and made it clear rate cuts were coming. \u201cWe don\u2019t need inflation to come back to target before we cut interest rates,\u201d Bailey said as he came under pressure from Conservative members of the Treasury committee to respond to news that the UK fell into recession in the second half of 2023. \u201cThe economy seems to be at full employment and that\u2019s a very good story,\u201d the governor said. In comparison to previous downturns, the UK was suffering from a \u201cvery small recession\u201d and was now showing \u201cdistinct signs of recovery\u201d, he added. The two quarters of negative growth last year only added up to a 0.5% drop in GDP. \u201cIf you look at recessions going back to the 1970s, this is the weakest by a long way,\u201d Bailey said. The range for previous recessions was for the economy to contract by between 2.5% and 22% over two quarters, he added. The annual inflation rate currently stands at 4% but Bailey said he expected it to come back to its 2% target temporarily within the next few months before rising to 2.75% by the end of 2024. The Bank\u2019s latest forecasts for inflation are based on the predicted path of interest rates in the financial markets, and these assume the first cut in borrowing costs in June or August this year. On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs said it expected the first rate cut to be made in June. It had previously forecast this would take place in May. Bailey said: \u201cI am comfortable with an interest rate profile that has cuts in it. What I am not saying is by how much they will be cut and when.\u201d Conservative MP John Baron asked why rates were not already being cut given that the economic warning signs were \u201cflashing red\u201d. The governor said the question for the Bank was how long interest rates needed to remain restrictive to bring inflation sustainably back to target. \u201cWe are not there yet, he said. The governor said there were \u201cencouraging signs\u201d inflation in the services sector and earnings growth \u2013 two of the key factors the MPC takes into account when setting rates \u2013 were moderating. Ben Broadbent, one of the Bank\u2019s deputy governors, supported Bailey\u2019s view that rate cuts were probable over the coming months. In an annual report to the Treasury committee, Broadbent said the Bank\u2019s forecasts don\u2019t rule out an easing of policy in 2024, adding: \u201cIn my view, that is the more likely direction in which Bank rate is likely to move. But even if that proves to be the case, the timing of any adjustment can only depend on the actual evolution of the economic data.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-18T11:56:36Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy is in a deep rut. After news confirming the country fell into recession late last year, most experts agree the downturn is likely to be shortlived and shallow. Few, though, are betting on a strong recovery from the toughest period for living standards in almost 70 years. In most of the economic cycles of the past century, robust growth has typically followed each period of recession, as households and businesses get back on their feet after each setback. But as highlighted by Matt Whittaker of the Pro Bono Economics thinktank, the past two decades have been different. Gross domestic product per capita has either fallen or flatlined for the past seven quarters, and it is now 16 years since the last sustained uptick came to an end. For whoever wins the next general election, making sure Britain can escape this quagmire ought to be the top priority. After more than a decade and a half of flatlining progress, capped by the current cost of living crisis, poverty levels have risen sharply. The proceeds of what little growth has been eked out are unevenly spread and geographically imbalanced, while the UK is slipping behind comparable advanced nations. To revive the sputtering engine of the economy, the next government will, however, need to keep in mind the kind of growth Britain would benefit from most. The plan will need two priorities in particular: tackling the inequalities entrenched over the past decade, and ensuring the biggest challenge of all \u2013 the climate crisis \u2013 is addressed. So far there is reluctance among political leaders to set out a clear roadmap, with Rishi Sunak promising tax cuts that would fail on the first priority while increasingly hacking away at policies that could help address the second. The prime minister had promised in the first weeks of his premiership to turn Britain into a \u201cclean energy superpower\u201d. Since then, however, Sunak has rowed back on net zero policies and leaned into anti-green politics to pacify the right of his party. Keir Starmer has also staged a managed retreat, having scaled back Labour\u2019s \u00a328bn green investment plan out of fear the Tories could weaponise it in the election campaign. At the heart of both is a common theme: affordability. The fallout from the 2008 financial crisis, Covid pandemic, Brexit and the cumulative drag on productivity from more than a decade of Tory underinvestment has indeed taken its toll on the exchequer, as has spiralling demand from an ageing population. The government\u2019s budget deficit is historically high, while the national debt has risen to the highest level since the 1960s. However, it also plays on two falsehoods. First, that inaction is cost-free. This is patently untrue, as the past 15 years of underinvestment have shown, laying the ground for our current weak economic performance. The consequences of the climate crisis are also becoming clearer and costlier for households and businesses. And second, that leaving the private sector alone to kickstart growth and manage the climate transition would be cheaper. The cost of investing in new technologies does not magically vanish in the private sector. Instead of being borne on the government balance sheet \u2013 paid for mostly through taxation \u2013 the household balance sheet picks it up instead, in the prices charged for utilities, goods and services. As a paper from the leftwing Common Wealth thinktank last week showed, state-led investment in clean energy could be substantially cheaper than the private sector equivalent, primarily through the difference in cheaper borrowing costs that nations enjoy over corporate borrowers, helping households to save money on their bills. Investing in the climate transition could also help kickstart economic growth, creating the jobs and industries of the future. The report set out the case for a more ambitious plan for Labour\u2019s Great British Energy, the party\u2019s publicly owned clean energy generation company. According to the report, Labour\u2019s initial \u00a38.3bn capitalisation of GB Energy could save between \u00a3125m and \u00a3208m a year on debt interest costs each year compared with equivalent borrowing in the private sector \u2013 saving up to \u00a31bn in total. While Starmer cut back Labour\u2019s overall \u00a328bn investment plan, the decision to keep and prioritise GB Energy is an important move. Plenty of details over its operation still need clarifying. And it could be more ambitious. But a publicly owned firm investing in renewable energy could help optimise the transition to net zero. One criticism would be that the state lacks the knowhow big energy companies possess, or would be less efficient than the private sector, adding to the cost of energy generation. However, it is increasingly clear the market alone is failing to deliver, as some of the wealthiest energy firms in history funnel profits into investor payouts rather than renewables. Over the last two years energy companies have benefited from a boom in prices since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, providing what ought to be a powerful war chest for the green transition. But analysis by the IPPR thinktank shows that BP and Shell alone handed \u00a332.6bn back to their investors in 2022 through dividends and share buybacks \u2013 11 times more than the \u00a32.9bn they invested in renewables. In a world of rising supply chain costs, geopolitical shocks and higher borrowing costs on financial markets, a state-backed firm could help de-risk the cost of renewables projects for private firms by co-investing alongside them. It makes even more sense when the approach is already the norm in Britain \u2013 only with companies owned by overseas governments rather than our own. Figures from Common Wealth show 42.2% of the installed capacity from operational and under-construction windfarms in the UK is owned by foreign public entities, including state-owned enterprises and public pension funds. Such is the lack of our own involvement that the UK government owns less of that capacity (0.03%) than the city of Munich does (0.85%) through its stake in the Gwynt y M\u00f4r windfarm off the north Wales coast. The next government will have choices to make. Powering up economic growth could be helped by a step-change in green investment. Rather than holding back amid fears over affordability, it\u2019s the cost of inaction that would hurt more."

            "content": "Joe Biden declared the strong jobs figures released on Friday as proof that \u201cAmerica\u2019s economy is the strongest in the world\u201d. The US jobs market defied fears of a downturn again, when figures were released on growth in January, with employers adding 353,000 new jobs over the month, the labor department announced. The jobs market has remained strong despite an aggressive series of interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve, aimed at cooling the economy and bringing down the rate of inflation. In January the unemployment rate was 3.7%, close to a 50-year low. Economists had been predicting that the US would add less than 200,000 jobs over the month. The labor department also revised its job gains for December up from an initial estimate of 216,000 to 333,000. The news was another boost to the US president, whose polling on the economy has remained weak despite the robust jobs market. Hiring was broad-based with gains in healthcare, government, professional and business services and retail. Biden pointed out that the US has added almost 15m jobs since he was sworn in in January 2021. In a statement from the White House, Biden said: \u201cToday, we saw more proof, with another month of strong wage gains and employment gains of over 350,000 in January, continuing the strong growth from last year \u2026 It\u2019s great news for working families that wages, wealth and jobs are higher now than before the pandemic, and I won\u2019t stop fighting to lower costs and build an economy from the middle out and bottom up.\u201d He further said: \u201cI\u2019ll continue to stand in the way of efforts by congressional Republicans to enact massive tax giveaways for the wealthy and big corporations; cut Medicare, Medicaid and social security; and raise costs for American families.\u201d But there have been signs recently that the strong labor market is weakening. On Wednesday, ADP, the US\u2019s largest payroll supplier, said private employers had added 107,000 new jobs in January, less than analysts expected and down from 158,000 in December. Several large employers have also announced layoffs recently, including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, PayPal and UPS. The US added 2.7m jobs last year even as the Fed drove interest rates up to a 22-year high. This week, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the US economy remained resilient and the rate of inflation \u2013 which has fallen from a high of just over 9% in June 2022 to 3.4% in December \u2013 was moving in the right direction. But the Fed is still targeting an annual rate of inflation of 2%. Powell warned: \u201cInflation is still too high, the ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain.\u201d The latest jobs report will add pressure for the Fed to maintain its current interest rates. \u201cThe big picture for now is that markets are no longer convinced that the Fed will cut rates in May, let alone March,\u201d Capital Economics said in a note."

            "date": "2024-02-27T06:00:13Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s net zero economy grew by 9% in 2023, a report has revealed, in stark contrast to the 0.1% growth seen in the economy overall. Nevertheless, the report pointed out that strong future growth from green businesses was being put at risk by government policy reversals, lack of investment and competition from the EU and US. Thousands of new green companies were founded in 2023 and overall the sector was responsible for the production of \u00a374bn in goods and services and 765,000 jobs, according to the report by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). Hotspots of net zero businesses and the well-paid jobs they provide occur across the country, rather than being concentrated in London and the south-east, the report found. It also highlighted strong net zero activity in some of the most deprived areas and in marginal constituencies that will be focal battlegrounds in the coming general election. Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 is vital to limiting the damage from the climate crisis. Doing so would not only bring an economic boost but also cut energy costs for households and businesses and ensure energy security by ending the UK\u2019s reliance on volatile fossil fuel markets, the report authors said. Peter Chalkley, the director of ECIU, said: \u201cAgainst the backdrop of economic stagnation, the net zero economy is bucking the trend, but it\u2019s clear that the policy U-turns of the past year have damaged investor confidence at a time when the US and EU are investing billions to compete for clean industries. The question now is: will political parties provide the leadership, stability and investment needed to generate further growth \u2013 or shy away from the global race for net zero?\u201d Louise Hellem, chief economist at the CBI, said: \u201cThe transition to net zero presents unprecedented opportunities for the UK to become a more resilient and productive economy while also tackling climate change. [Businesses] really don\u2019t want to see net zero issues politicised.\u201d Rishi Sunak, the Conservative prime minister, has weakened net zero policies including the rollout of electric vehicles and heat pumps and backed new oil and gas drilling, against the advice of scientists. The UK has also recently fallen down an index of attractiveness for renewable energy investment. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, recently halved a pledge to invest \u00a328bn a year in the green economy. Adriana Curca, manager of CBI Economics, said: \u201cWe quite often tend to think about the costs involved in the net zero transition, but there are a lot of economic opportunities, having a real potential to drive sustainable long-term growth.\u201d The new report analysed the green economy, including renewable energy, building energy efficiency, electric vehicles, carbon capture technology and green finance. It found net zero jobs were on average \u00a310,000 better paid than the UK average of \u00a335,400, and 50% more productive, generating \u00a3114,300 in economic activity overall. The number of net zero businesses rose by 4,000 to 23,745 in 2023. The report found hotspots of net zero activity in some of the most deprived parts of the country, including Hartlepool, Nottingham, Redcar and Cleveland, all of which are in the 10% most deprived local authorities. It also found that half of the top 50 net zero hotspots in England and Wales were in the top 50 most marginal Conservative seats to be contested at the general election, including High Peak, Cheadle, Derby North, and Lancaster and Wyre. Adriana Curca: \u201cThese [net zero] jobs go a long way towards improving living standards in those areas.\u201d Thomas Farquhar at cleantech business Heatio said: \u201cThe UK net zero economy offers huge opportunities for new, innovative businesses to grow. Frustratingly, we are lagging behind the rest of Europe.\u201d Farquhar said only 1% of UK homes had transitioned to low carbon dioxide heating, compared with 66% in Norway; and only 5% of suitable UK homes had installed solar panels, compared with 16% in the Netherlands. The UK\u2019s National Infrastructure Commission said on Friday that the \u201cgovernment needs to move faster to ensure that the necessary [energy] infrastructure can be delivered over the next decade\u201d. The International Monetary Fund said in December that the \u201ceconomic benefits of accelerating the transition to a low carbon economy vastly outweigh its cost\u201d. A London School of Economics report published in January concluded that \u201ctoo much current investment continues to be in the unsustainable economy\u201d, such as oil and gas and new homes and offices that are not energy-efficient. It said: \u201cThe UK needs to increase annual public investment by around 1% of GDP \u2013 \u00a326bn at current prices \u2013 to make up for decades of underinvestment. There will be upfront investment costs, but targeted and temporary borrowing for good public net investment is fiscally responsible.\u201d A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \u201cWe welcome these findings, which are testament to our world-leading plans to transform the energy industry towards more clean and renewable energy. We have a clear strategy to boost UK industry and reach net zero - with over 80,000 green jobs being supported or in the pipeline since 2020, and over \u00a3200bn in public and private low carbon investment since 2010.\u201d"

On 2 February, the US embassy in China posted an update on its Weibo account about tracking giraffes in Namibia using GPS technology. As of Monday afternoon local time, the post had received approximately 166,000 comments, many of them about China\u2019s economic pains. \u201cWho can help me? I\u2019ve been unemployed for a long time,\u201d wrote one commenter. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a few comments about stocks, will they be deleted?\u201d wrote another. Other comments, reported by Bloomberg, included: \u201cIf criticisms are not allowed, then praises are meaningless\u201d and negative references to China\u2019s stock market. Weibo, which has 593 million monthly active users, moderates comments that are posted on the platform. Threads beneath posts by foreign organisations, such as the US embassy, are a slightly more permissive environment for commenters than those below posts by Chinese state agencies, which often take it upon themselves to ensure that discussions stay within government\u2019s red lines. Many of the comments on the US embassy\u2019s post appeared to have been scrubbed from the platform as of Monday, or drowned out by comments saying variations on \u201cI love China\u201d. Chinese authorities are increasingly concerned about gloomy commentary as the economy struggles to rebuild momentum after the lifting of the country\u2019s harsh \u201czero-Covid\u201d pandemic restrictions. In December, social media influencers were warned against making public comments that would \u201cbad-mouth the economy\u201d. The restrictions on negative comments have failed to mask the fact that China\u2019s stock market is flailing. The CSI 300 index, which tracks the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses, tumbled nearly 5% last week to a a five-year low. On Sunday, the Chinese securities regulatory commission said it would step up market stabilisation measures. The popularity of the US embassy\u2019s post about giraffes prompted giraffe-related comments elsewhere on Weibo. In one since deleted comment, a user wrote: \u201cThe giraffe has reached a new high. Even though many comments have been deleted and many likes have been deleted, it has still reached a new high! Weibo administrators and your editors, thank you for your hard work. The holidays keep you so busy.\u201d"

            "content": "Factories destroyed. Roads blown to pieces. Power plants put out of action. Steel exports decimated. A flood of refugees out of the country. Ukraine \u2013 the poorest country in Europe \u2013 has paid a heavy economic price for a two-year war against Russia waged almost entirely on its own soil. The figures are stark. More than 7 million people \u2013 about a fifth of the population \u2013 have been plunged into poverty. Fifteen years of human development have been lost. In the first year of the war, the economy contracted by 30%. Yet it could have been even worse. Beata Javorcik, chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said 90% of businesses in the areas of Ukraine where there was no fighting are still going concerns. Inflation has come down from a peak of 27% to less than 5%. Even so, Ukraine\u2019s economy remains on a knife edge. It needs more than $40bn (\u00a331bn) of western aid this year to balance the books and keep the military equipped. The costs of piecing the country back together again is put at $486bn over 10 years \u2013 up from $411bn a year ago. \u201cThe last two years have seen unprecedented suffering and loss for Ukraine and its people,\u201d said Antonella Bassani, World Bank vice-president for Europe and central Asia. By contrast, Russia has emerged from two years of war looking relatively unscathed. Soon after the war started, the International Monetary Fund said it expected the Russian economy to suffer a severe two-year recession \u2013 contracting by 8.5% in 2022 and a further 2.3% in 2023. The economy did shrink in 2022, but only by just over 2%, and in 2023 it grew \u2013 according to the latest IMF estimates \u2013 by 3%. There is no hard evidence that the war effort has forced ordinary Russians to tighten their belts. Generous welfare benefits have underpinned incomes while a tight labour market has supported strong wages growth. Illustrating the point, consumer spending rose 6% last year. Moreover, Russia entered the war in a strong position financially. Vladimir Putin planned for an invasion with a high oil price that filled his exchequer with funds, and with a debt-to-GDP ratio down about 20%. Last year, Russia\u2019s budget deficit was limited to just over 1% of GDP. On the downside, labour shortages caused by conscription have pushed up prices. The official inflation rate has almost halved, from 11.5% last autumn to 6.6% in January, but this month the central bank maintained its tough stance to prevent a resurgence, pegging interest rates at 16%. There are a number of reasons for Russia\u2019s resilience. Its economy was 10 times the size of Ukraine\u2019s when the war started. Its physical infrastructure has not been flattened. A huge increase in the defence budget has boosted growth. Finally, Putin has been preparing Russia for the conflict for years \u2013 using oil and gas proceeds to accumulate reserves and taking steps to sanction-proof the economy. Tim Ash, a Russia expert at the Chatham House thinktank, said Russia\u2019s resilience was unsurprising. \u201cOnly Putin knew there was going to be a war and he had prepared for it. But it\u2019s clear that sanctions are removing some of the financial buffers and stockpiles built up ahead of the invasion.\u201d Mark Harrison, an economic historian and emeritus professor at Warwick University, said Putin had ramped up defence spending from 3% of national income to nearer 7%, and it could hit 10% over the next year. \u201cBut Putin doesn\u2019t know any more than we do where the tolerance of the Russian people lies. The process of feeling for those limits is different for an authoritarian leader because he knows the people won\u2019t tell him, or at least not until it is too late for his leadership to survive.\u201d Javorcik said it was unrealistic to expect the first wave of sanctions to bring the economy to its knees. Domestically produced goods were replacing western imports, while Russia was also able to source goods directly through China and Turkey and indirectly from countries acting as intermediaries for western products. \u201cSanctions are working,\u201d Javorcik said. \u201cBut they are working slowly.\u201d Being cut off from western technology, capital, knowledge and management techniques will lead to weaker productivity growth, the impact of which will be amplified by the loss of human capital caused by skilled workers leaving the country. Mark Sobel, of the thinktank OMFIF, said: \u201cA cursory examination of current Russian data \u2013 such as growth and inflation \u2013 might suggest that the economy is \u2018resilient\u2019 in the face of the costs of Russia continuing its ruthless invasion. That view may contain elements of validity in the short term. But it overlooks weaknesses and realities. Significantly greater isolation and economic degradation are baked in the cake for the Russian economy and people.\u201d The scale of the damage to Ukraine coupled with the failure of sanctions to force Putin to back down have forced the west to consider what to do next. One option \u2013 favoured by both Ash and Harrison \u2013 is to tighten sanctions still further. Harrison draws a comparison with the western front in 1918 and the collapse of German morale after the allies tightened their blockade, preventing vital supplies reaching civilians and the army alike. \u201cRussia is not at this stage yet, but if sanctions are tightened, who knows when war-weariness takes hold,\u201d he said. \u201cA war plan involves your enemy running out of options as it runs out of resources. And in the interests of the west, that needs to be Russia.\u201d Ash said there were signs of sanctions becoming tougher. Big lenders in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are reported to have begun closing bank accounts of Russian nationals and limiting settlements with Russia. Some Chinese banks and Turkish lenders are understood to have reacted to US threats in December to cut off access to foreign banks doing business with companies that support Russia\u2019s defence industry. There is also also pressure on the G7 to seize Russia\u2019s frozen reserves and use them as collateral to raise debt for the reconstruction of Ukraine. Almost $300bn of Russian assets have been immobilised since the invasion two years ago. The UK and the US have warmed to this idea but EU members of the G7 warn there is no basis in international law for seizing the assets of a foreign country. Since more than half the Russian reserves are held in the EU \u2013 mainly in Belgium \u2013 there are fears seizure could lead to international investors dumping the euro on currency markets. A compromise could be to seize the interest on these reserves, which amounts to an estimated $15bn. While that debate goes on, Ukraine faces an immediate cash crisis and needs financial help to fill a $39bn black hole in its budget. Spending this year is expected to be just over $81bn while revenues are forecast to be a little more than $43bn. The defence budget alone comes to just under $42bn. The EU and the IMF have continued financial support but US aid is being blocked by Congress. \u201cIt would be extremely unfortunate if a lack of money meant that Ukraine\u2019s macroeconomic stability, which has been achieved during wartime, were thrown out of the window,\u201d Javorcik said. Without further funding, Ukraine would become a failed state, he said. \u201cAnd that would affect European countries through a potential second refugee wave and instability on its eastern border.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-04T11:06:27Z",
            "content": "Tough choices. We must be willing to make tough choices. It is a soundbite heard frequently from politicians, often accompanied by another chestnut: there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. Both statements are true. Free lunches are few and far between. There are tough choices that need to be made. But, like most other developed countries in similar circumstances, Britain is reluctant to make them. Tough choices implies a willingness to make sacrifices and that doesn\u2019t fit well with the west\u2019s \u201cI want it all now\u201d culture. Politicians pander to this. They talk about the need to make tough choices but in fact look for the soft option, because that\u2019s what keeps the punters happy. The debate over immigration is a case in point. Migration is a hot topic here, as it is in Germany, France, the Netherlands and the US. What\u2019s more, it is certain to remain a salient political issue. Last week, the Office for National Statistics published its latest projections for the size of the UK\u2019s population. These showed the number of people living in the UK rising to 70 million by 2026 \u2013 a decade earlier than previously envisaged \u2013 and continuing to increase over the following decade to 73.7 million. Net migration \u2013 the number of people entering the UK minus the number leaving \u2013 is expected to account for more than 90% of the 6.6 million increase in the population between 2021 and 2036. Just to be clear, these are not ONS forecasts but rather projections based on net migration of 315,000 from 2028 onwards. This would be much lower than the record 672,000 in the year to June 2023 but significantly higher than in any previous period. When Tony Blair became prime minister in 1997, for example, net migration was 48,000. When David Cameron entered Downing Street in 2010 the figure stood at 256,000. One response to these projections is to say: what\u2019s the problem? If people from other parts of the world want to come here then they are welcome to come. Migration is globalisation in action: workers from poor countries seeking out job opportunities in countries where they can earn higher wages and enjoy better living standards. Migrants can make the economy grow faster and they do the jobs home-born workers are reluctant to do. Without migrant workers the care system would collapse and NHS waiting lists would be even longer than they are already. Without foreign students, the higher education system would be in deep financial trouble. Given the UK\u2019s ageing population, it makes no economic sense to put an arbitrary limit on net migration. Let\u2019s assume all the above is correct. Put to one side the fact that much higher levels of net migration have coincided with only weak growth in per capita incomes. Whether or not migration is good for growth, if the UK\u2019s population is to increase on the scale envisaged over the next decade or so, then this country will have to be prepared to build (and pay for) the infrastructure to service a much-expanded citizenry. That means more schools, more hospitals, more capacity on the transport network and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 more houses. The current level of homes built in the UK is about half that of its postwar peak of 425,000 recorded in 1968, a time when the population was 12 million smaller than it is today and 19 million smaller than it is expected to be by the mid-2030s. The supply of homes is already insufficient to meet existing demands and those pressures are only going to increase if the ONS projections are right. And that means, you guessed it, tough choices. If housing supply is to keep up with demand it will mean liberalising the planning rules. It might even involve building on the green belt. It will certainly lead to a struggle between whoever is in government and those who think demand can be met simply by developing brownfield sites. The consequences of a 10% increase in the population without a significant increase in the supply of new homes are obvious: rampant house-price inflation; more overcrowding; ever-higher numbers of children living with their parents into their 30s; more people squeezed into private-rented accommodation, and a growing divide between the housing haves and the housing have nots. So how about some serious immigration controls instead? Wouldn\u2019t they be an alternative to concreting over the green belt? In theory, yes. It was not so long ago that annual net migration hovered around zero. In 1990 and 1991, for example, it averaged 40,000 a year; in the following two years it fell by 6,000 a year on average. In practice, of course, returning to those levels of net migration would also have consequences. Care homes would need to charge more to attract UK-born workers. Universities would no longer be able to use the fees from foreign students to subsidise those from the UK. Businesses that have come to rely on migrant workers would become unviable. Again, one response would be: so what? If the business model of care homes relies on cheap foreign labour and that of universities relies on expensive foreign students then there is something wrong with those business models. But while the long-term solution might well be a different economic model \u2013 higher wage, higher productivity, more highly automated \u2013 getting to that better world will not be easy or cost-free. It means either higher taxes to pay for higher levels of public spending or higher prices for consumers, and quite possibly both. So there\u2019s a choice that has to be made: embrace high levels of net migration and fundamentally rethink housing; or reduce net migration to late 20th-century levels and fundamentally rethink the economy. It can\u2019t be ducked."

            "content": "When Pakistan holds an election, there\u2019s an established pattern to how things generally play out. The military selects a preferred candidate (in this case Nawaz Sharif), and then discredits/exiles/imprisons the main challenger (in this case, Imran Khan). The vote is held and the military\u2019s preferred candidate wins. It\u2019s no wonder they are known inside the country as \u201cthe generals\u2019 elections\u201d. This time, things didn\u2019t go quite according to plan. Despite Khan having been safely locked up, his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party came out on top \u2013 though not with an overall majority, sparking allegations of serious vote-rigging from PTI supporters. In this week\u2019s edition, our correspondents in the region, Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shah Meer Baloch, explain how the military had tried and failed to stifle the PTI and its voters into submission before last week\u2019s vote. How will this all play out? On Tuesday (after the Weekly went to press), it was confirmed that Nawaz Sharif\u2019s PML-N party would after all form the government, in a complex coalition with the Pakistan People\u2019s party (PPP). Shehbaz Sharif, Nawaz\u2019s younger brother who is known to be close to the military, is likely to be prime minister, with the PPP co-chair Asif Ali Zardari as president. So did the generals get their way after all? Maybe not. A marriage of convenience between two weak political parties, in defiance of the popular vote, merely illustrates the shaky state of Pakistan\u2019s democracy, and seems unlikely to last for long. On behalf of the GW team, we hope you enjoy this week\u2019s edition \u2013 here are some of the other highlights you can look forward to when the magazine arrives. *** Five essential reads in this week\u2019s edition 1 Spotlight | Is Britain running low on royals? With King Charles undergoing cancer treatment and his heir, William, focusing on his young family after his wife Catherine\u2019s recent illness, the slimmed-down royal family is struggling to plug the gaps in the engagement diary, writes Caroline Davies. 2 Photography | The world views of Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado The celebrated Brazilian photojournalist reflects on a life spent capturing defining images of the natural world. 3 Heath and wellbeing | Sweet nothing Viv Groskop travels to the Netherlands to investigate the concept of niksen, the Dutch antidote to burnout. 4 Feature | Not going out Is a misspent youth a thing of the past? Gaby Hinsliff investigates how teens and twentysomethings became the homebody generation. 5 Culture | The real Yoko Artists and critics explain why, throughout a career spanning six decades, Yoko Ono has always stayed on top. *** What else we\u2019ve been reading I was drawn in by the story told by Kevin Adkisson, part of the Von Erich wrestling family in 1980s Texas. Readers who are planning to see The Iron Claw, named after the family\u2019s signature move and starring a bulked-up Zac Efron, might want to look away now (spoiler alert!) but Adkisson\u2019s resolve after years of the kind of heartbreak that would leave most people on the canvas is something to behold.

            "title": "Repression in Venezuela intensifying ahead of elections, rights groups say",
            "date": "2024-02-22T12:00:52Z",
            "content": "Human rights groups are calling for the Venezuelan government to halt a crackdown on civil society after it jailed a prominent lawyer and then banished a UN human rights office from Caracas for criticising her arrest. The arrest of the 57-year-old lawyer and military expert Roc\u00edo San Miguel has shocked observers, who say Venezuela is entering a darker phase of state oppression intended to crush government opposition in the lead-up to elections expected later this year. When the UN human rights office criticised San Miguel\u2019s detention, the government ordered its staff to leave the country within 72 hours. \u201cThe expulsion of the UN high commissioner and his office is the latest attempt from the government to isolate itself from international scrutiny on its human rights record,\u201d said Valentina Ballesta, Amnesty International\u2019s researcher for South America. \u201cThe international community must not give up on shining a spotlight on this issue.\u201d San Miguel was arrested at an airport outside Caracas on 9 February as she was about to fly to Miami on holiday with her daughter. Her family were given no information of her whereabouts for two days until they were informed that she had been put on trial for allegedly plotting to kill the Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Five members of her family, including two ex-partners, were also detained by police. San Miguel\u2019s family say she has not been allowed to appoint a lawyer to defend her against the allegations. \u201cLimiting the right to legal defence was already common practice in Venezuela,\u201d says Gonzalo Himiob, a lawyer and a founding member of Foro Penal, an NGO that tracks political prisoners. \u201cNow there is this new practice of completely isolating the detainees from their families and lawyers to impede any defence.\u201d The Venezuelan government has often used state institutions \u2013 particularly the courts and intelligence agencies \u2013 to silence critics since the country\u2019s economic collapse accelerated in 2014. Maduro and other senior Venezuelan officials have been accused by the UN human rights council of committing crimes against humanity, including torture, kidnapping and extrajudicial killings. With elections on the horizon the government has begun using a more alarming strategy to throttle civic space, rights groups say. As well as allegedly using trumped-up terrorism charges to jail critics, the state is reportedly also rounding up their friends and family members. In one case a woman was tortured and given a 30-year sentence for simply sharing a taxi with someone accused of plotting against the government. \u201cThe repression may have become more selective, but it is also growing more severe,\u201d Himiob said. Allegations of conspiracy were accompanied by an \u201cintense and systematic\u201d state-media campaign, according to Himiob. The arrest of San Miguel caught experts by surprise. Her high profile along with her Spanish nationality and international connections were once thought sufficient to shield her from Maduro\u2019s autocratic government. San Miguel is also seen as a moderate political voice and is best known for her research exposing corruption in the Venezuelan army. \u201cNo one will believe that Rocio should be involved in this rather crazy-looking coup plot,\u201d said Phil Gunson, an analyst at International Crisis Group. \u201cClearly this is intended to send a message to civil society that no one is safe from these arbitrary arrests.\u201d Analysts say that Maduro is stepping up his assault on civil society to ensure victory in \u201cfree and fair\u201d elections promised to the opposition in exchange for US sanctions relief. Three aides to the opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado were arrested in January on treason charges, while the government-aligned supreme court upheld a ban on Machado\u2019s candidacy. Venezuela\u2019s congress is expected soon to rubber stamp a law regulating civil society groups that UN investigators say would be \u201ca point of no return in the closure of the civic and democratic space in Venezuela\u201d. \u201cThe government is trying to tackle the last standing resistance,\u201d Ballesta said. Rights groups are calling on governments to criticise San Miguel\u2019s arrest and the expulsion of the UN\u2019s human rights office. A White House spokesperson told reporters last week that the US was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the arrest of San Miguel."

            "title": "AI firm considers banning creation of political images for 2024 elections",
            "date": "2024-02-10T17:52:55Z",
            "content": "The groundbreaking artificial intelligence image-generating company Midjourney is considering banning people from using its software to make political images of Joe Biden and Donald Trump as part of an effort to avoid being used to distract from or misinform about the 2024 US presidential election. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much I care about political speech for the next year for our platform,\u201d Midjourney\u2019s CEO, David Holz, said last week, adding that the company is close to \u201chammering\u201d \u2013 or banning \u2013 political images, including those of the leading presidential candidates, \u201cfor the next 12 months\u201d. In a conversation with Midjourney users in a chatroom on Discord, as reported by Bloomberg, Holz went on to say: \u201cI know it\u2019s fun to make Trump pictures \u2013 I make Trump pictures. Trump is aesthetically really interesting. However, probably better to just not, better to pull out a little bit during this election. We\u2019ll see.\u201d AI-generated imagery has recently become a concern. Two weeks ago, pornographic imagery featuring the likeness of Taylor Swift triggered lawmakers and the so-called Swifties who support the singer to demand stronger protections against AI-generated images. The Swift images were traced back to 4chan, a community message board often linked to the sharing of sexual, racist, conspiratorial, violent or otherwise antisocial material with or without the use of AI. Holz\u2019s comments come as safeguards created by image-generator operators are playing a game of cat-and-mouse with users to prevent the creation of questionable content. AI in the political realm is causing increasing concern, though the MIT Technology Review recently noted that discussion about how AI may threaten democracy \u201clacks imagination\u201d. \u201cPeople talk about the danger of campaigns that attack opponents with fake images (or fake audio or video) because we already have decades of experience dealing with doctored images,\u201d the review noted. It added: \u201cWe\u2019re unlikely to be able to attribute a surprising electoral outcome to any particular AI intervention.\u201d Still, the image-generation company Inflection AI said in October that the company\u2019s chatbot, Pi, would not be allowed to advocate for any political candidate. Co-founder Mustafa Suleyman told a Wall Street Journal conference that chatbots \u201cprobably [have] to remain a human part of the process\u201d even if they function perfectly. Meta\u2019s Facebook said last week that it plans to label posts created using AI tools as part of a broader effort to combat election-year misinformation. Microsoft-affiliated OpenAI has said it will add watermarks to images made with its platforms to combat political deepfakes produced by AI. \u201cProtecting the integrity of elections requires collaboration from every corner of the democratic process, and we want to make sure our technology is not used in a way that could undermine this process,\u201d the company said in a blog post last month. OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said at an event recently: \u201cThe thing that I\u2019m most concerned about is that with new capabilities with AI \u2026 there will be better deepfakes than in 2020.\u201d In January, a faked audio call purporting to be Joe Biden telling New Hampshire voters to stay home illustrated the potential of AI political manipulation. The FCC later announced a ban on AI-generated voices in robocalls. \u201cWhat we\u2019re really realizing is that the gulf between innovation, which is rapidly increasing, and our consideration \u2013 our ability as a society to come together to understand best practices, norms of behavior, what we should do, what should be new legislation \u2013 that\u2019s still moving painfully slow,\u201d David Ryan Polgar, the president of the non-profit All Tech Is Human, previously told the Guardian. Midjourney software was responsible for a fake image of Trump being handcuffed by agents. Others that have appeared online include Biden and Trump as elderly men knitting sweaters co-operatively, Biden grinning while firing a machine gun and Trump meeting Pope Francis in the White House. The software already has a number of safeguards in place. Midjourney\u2019s community standards guidelines prohibit images that are \u201cdisrespectful, harmful, misleading public figures/events portrayals or potential to mislead\u201d. Bloomberg noted that what is permitted or not permitted varies according to the software version used. An older version of Midjourney produced an image of Trump covered in spaghetti, but a newer version did not. But if Midjourney bans the generation of AI-generated political images, consumers \u2013 among them voters \u2013 will probably be unaware. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably just hammer it and not say anything,\u201d Holz said."

            "title": "The Guardian view on Indonesia\u2019s elections: Prabowo\u2019s win is dismal news for democracy | Editorial",
            "date": "2024-02-15T18:36:07Z",
            "content": "When Joko Widodo took power in Indonesia 10 years ago, his victory brought relief as well as celebration. It was not merely that the former Jakarta governor was the first president to be elected from outside the political or military elite. It was also that he defeated ex-general Prabowo Subianto, who had attacked direct elections and said that he would take the country in a more authoritarian direction. There was every reason to take that threat seriously. Mr Prabowo was dismissed from the military \u2013 and barred from entering the US \u2013 due to allegations of the abduction and torture of activists by men in his unit, though he has always denied involvement. Yet now, as the president leaves office, Mr Prabowo is set to replace him \u2013 thanks in large part to his former rival\u2019s (unofficial) support. With 205 million voters and 820,000 polling stations spread across the thousands of islands in the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation, completing the final tally could take weeks. But Mr Prabowo, currently defence minister, enjoys a commanding lead in \u201cquick counts\u201d by independent polling firms, which have proved accurate in previous contests. That suggests he will not face a runoff. Having reached his two-term limit, the president \u2013 known to all as Jokowi \u2013 is leaving office with enviably high popularity ratings and a track record that includes steady economic growth, infrastructure development, slowed deforestation (though the country has fallen short of targets) and healthcare improvements. But he has also overseen a democratic backsliding. When he first took office, some supporters voiced concern that his principles might even hinder his ability to get things done. In reality, he has not only proved adept at making deals with the old elites but has undermined key institutions and strengthened restrictions on freedom of speech. The final straw, for many of his enthusiastic early supporters and reportedly for cabinet colleagues, has been his electoral manoeuvring. Jokowi said he was neutral. But it was plain that he had thrown his weight behind Mr Prabowo rather than his own party\u2019s candidate, Ganjar Pranowo. His 36-year-old son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, ran as Mr Prabowo\u2019s vice-president, despite being four years short of the usual minimum age for the role, thanks to a handy ruling from the constitutional court. The chief justice happens to be married to the president\u2019s sister. Many of those who once supported Jokowi have concluded that his priority is his legacy. Mr Prabowo also benefited from his improbable rebranding from fiery would-be strongman to a cuddly, cat-loving grandfather figure, aided by social media. Half the country\u2019s electorate is under 40; many voters do not remember his past or the days of military dictatorship under his father-in-law, Gen Suharto. Those who do predict that \u201cwinter is coming\u201d. Some suggest that the new president may conclude that he does not need outright autocracy, but can achieve what he wants within the current system. A better cause for optimism may be that Jokowi\u2019s tenure saw the largest student protests since democracy\u2019s return in 1998, prompted by his weakening of the anti-corruption commission and other harsh new laws. His political trajectory is further evidence that the work of defending reform and rights cannot rest on the shoulders of a single leader. But Indonesian democracy appears to have plenty of defenders, including among the young. There is every sign it will need them. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "date": "2024-02-28T11:00:24Z",
            "content": "A new program will help local elections officials with legal assistance and technical needs that come along with increased threats to their work and their lives, especially during the heated 2024 election cycle. The Public Rights Project\u2019s election protection hub plans to reach more than 200 elections officials, targeting states with close races but open to local elections officials anywhere in the US. Their work will include legal representation for local officials, filing amicus briefs on behalf of elections officials in critical court cases, helping them respond to misinformation, elevating them as trusted resources for voters and standing up for local interests in battles against state legislatures. They also plan to fight against efforts to hand-count ballots and litigate any challenges made by others to tabulation, as well as push back against frivolous public records requests that have hit some elections offices. The non-profit\u2019s move comes as local elections officials report ongoing threats and harassment, often stemming from mis- and disinformation spread by politicians. A stream of elections officials have left their jobs after enduring years of these attacks on their jobs. Some have seen the threats against them result in criminal charges for those who called, emailed or posted online claiming they would injure or kill people running elections. Alongside these threats, elections officials are also seeing efforts by lawmakers and other elected officials in their states to alter the way they administer the vote, sometimes without taking into account the needs of the people who actually run elections on the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s death by 1,000 cuts for these local officials,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, an attorney with the Public Rights Project. \u201cWe just think it\u2019s really important for these noble public servants \u2013 they\u2019re doing it because they believe in the right to vote, they believe in supporting their communities \u2013 to make sure that they\u2019re given the support that they need, so that they can do their jobs, because ultimately the ability to run the elections rises and falls with local officials.\u201d The project, founded by Jill Habig, the former special counsel in then-California attorney general Kamala Harris\u2019s office, focuses its overall work on state and local issues and officials, including elections, reproductive rights and instances where states attempt to infringe the rights of local officials. Habig, an attorney, recently filed an amicus brief in the US supreme court case over Trump\u2019s potential disqualification from office because of the 14th amendment, where she wrote alongside historians who argued from an originalist perspective that Trump should be removed from the ballot. The Public Rights Project has previously filed supporting briefs in elections-related cases to elevate the voices and interests of local elections officials. The group envisions doing more of the same in cases this year, intending to protect people\u2019s votes and elections officials\u2019 ability to do their job without interference from states or outside actors. The organization\u2019s legal support is offered free of charge for these officials as part of the hub. Clifford Tatum was one of those local officials who could have used assistance from the hub. Tatum, who is now consulting with the project on this new program, was the elections administrator in Texas\u2019s Harris county, until a new state law that targeted the county closed his office and distributed its duties to other county officials. Tatum said he would not be an elections official again \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve shared my level of blood, sweat and tears\u201d \u2013 but he wants to use his experience to help others in similar positions through the hub\u2019s work. His brief time running elections in the county included professional and personal attacks, some stumbles with paper shortages and wait times in the 2022 midterms, lawsuits against the county over those mistakes, a criminal inquiry, calls for his resignation and, finally, the dissolution of the office. He had moved to Houston in summer 2022, giving him just a few months to prepare for that year\u2019s election. While he had resources to defend the county\u2019s actions while he was the election administrator, he did not have the ability to defend himself or his own legal interests with county resources, a scenario where a program like the election protection hub could step in. \u201cI felt isolated. I felt that I wasn\u2019t able to control the narrative and if you lose the narrative, you basically lose the war,\u201d he said. After his office and the county saw threats online against Tatum, he needed a daily security detail. The security team drove him to and from work, was with him all day for any meetings or movements. If he needed to run an errand, the security came along. When he initially moved to Houston, he purposefully chose a secure building, knowing the level of vitriol that often comes with working elections these days. \u201cIt really changed the way I lived in Houston and experienced Houston, Harris county, because I just didn\u2019t know what was waiting for me out there,\u201d Tatum said."

            "title": "Greener snowmaking is helping ski resorts tackle climate change ",
            "date": "2024-02-23T09:30:43Z",
            "content": "Trudging across the top of Bromley Mountain Ski Resort on a sunny afternoon in January, Matt Folts checks his smartwatch and smiles: 14 degrees fahrenheit. That is very nearly his favorite temperature for making snow. It\u2019s cold enough for water to quickly crystallize, but not so cold that his hourslong shifts on the mountain are miserable. Folts is the head snowmaker at Bromley, a small ski area on the southern end of Vermont\u2019s Green Mountains. The burly 35-year-old sports a handlebar moustache, an orange safety jacket, and thick winter boots that crunch in the snow as he walks. A blue hammer swings from his belt. It is nearing the end of the day for skiers, but not for Folts. He\u2019ll work well into the evening preparing the mountain for tomorrow\u2019s crowd. Cutting across the entrances to Sunder and Corkscrew, he heads toward a stubby snow gun used to blanket Blue Ribbon, an experts-only trail named in honor of Bromley\u2019s founder, Fred Pabst Jr. The apparatus stands a few feet high, with three legs and a metal head that\u2019s angled toward the sky. Two lines that resemble fire hoses supply the device with water and compressed air, which it uses to hiss precipitation into the air. As the water droplets fall, they coalesce into snowflakes. \u201cIf it was warmer I\u2019d be a yeti,\u201d says Folts, referring to wetter snow that, if conditions were just a bit balmier, would leave him abominably white. But at these temperatures the powder he\u2019d just made bounced lightly off his sleeve. \u201cThat\u2019s perfect.\u201d Yet perfect fake fluff like Folts\u2019 poses a climate conundrum. On one hand, making snow requires enormous amounts of energy, which creates planet-warming emissions. On the other, a warming planet means that artificial snow is increasingly essential to an industry that, while admittedly a luxury, pumps over $20bn annually into ski towns nationwide. The good news is that, in the face of these growing threats, resorts have been dramatically improving the efficiency of their snowmaking operations \u2013 a move they hope will help them outrun rising temperatures. American ski areas logged more 65 million visits last season. A sizable chunk of those likely came during Christmas week, when a resort can make \u2013 or lose \u2013 a third or more of its annual revenue. The Martin Luther King Jr and Presidents Day weekends are similarly vital. But ensuring that there\u2019s a surface to slide on is an increasingly fickle business. Snowpack in the western US has already declined by 23% since 1955, and climbing temperatures have pushed the snowline in Lake Tahoe, California \u2013 which is home to more than a dozen resorts \u2013 from 1,200 to 1,500 feet. A recent study found that much of the northern hemisphere is heading off a \u201csnow-loss cliff\u201d where even marginal increases in temperature could prompt a dramatic loss of snow. By one estimate, only about half of the ski areas in the Northeast will be economically viable by mid-century. Research suggests that Vermont\u2019s ski season could be two to four weeks shorter by 2080, while another study found that Canada\u2019s snowmaking needs will increase 67 to 90% by 2050. At Bromley, snow guns have been essential for years; without them, the resort\u2019s mid-January trail count would have likely been in the single digits, rather than 31. Opening terrain, however, comes at a cost. It takes a lot of horsepower to move water up the hill under pressure, and compress the air the guns need to function. Bromley\u2019s relatively small operation, which produces enough snow each season to cover about 55 hectares (135 acres) in three or more feet of the stuff, chews through enough electricity each year to power about 100 homes. All that juice adds nearly $500,000 to the resort\u2019s utility bill. But Bill Cairns, Bromley\u2019s president and general manager, says the system is actually much more efficient than it was just a decade ago. \u201cI used to spend about $800,000,\u201d he says. He\u2019s now able to produce more snow for around half the price. \u201cThe reduction in cost with snowmaking has totally been a gamechanger.\u201d Powder days start with specks of dust high in the atmosphere. As they fall, water droplets attach to them, forming snowflakes. Ski areas like Bromley replicate this natural process using miles of pipes that feed water and compressed air to hundreds, sometimes thousands, of snow guns scattered across a mountain. Early guns mixed compressed air and water inside a chamber, and then used air pressure to propel water droplets skyward through a large nozzle. This was the type of system Fred Pabst Jr, of beer family fame, spent $1m installing in 1965, making his resort one of America\u2019s earliest adopters. \u201cIt was a black art. We knew nothing,\u201d says Slavko Stanchak, whose inventions and expertise have made him a legend among snowmakers. It was an era when energy was relatively cheap and resorts would rent rows of diesel-powered compressors that threw whatever snow they could generate on the hill. But as energy costs rose in the 1990s and early 2000s, so did the impetus to innovate. \u201cWe focused on making the process viable from a business standpoint,\u201d Stanchak says. He launched a consulting company that helped ski areas, including Bromley, design or improve their snowmaking operations. On the water side of the equation, Bromley spent the 1990s improving its piping network and added a mid-mountain pump to help get H2O from its ponds to its trails. (Much of the water returns to the watershed during the spring melt.) But the amount of water needed to carpet a ski hill in snow remains relatively fixed from year to year, so there are only so many efficiency gains to be had. Compressing air is what really eats into a budget. \u201cThe air is where the little dollar bills fly out,\u201d says Cairns, adding that two diesel compressors can consume a tanker truck of fuel every week. The 1990s also saw more efficient snow guns come to market. Tinkerers discovered that devices with multiple small holes, instead of a single large aperture, could utilize water, rather than air pressure, to force fluid upward. This allowed them to move the compressed air nozzles to the outside of the barrel, where they would primarily break the water stream into droplets \u2013 a far less strenuous function than forcing them out of the gun. \u201cAn old-school hog might use 800 cubic feet per minute [of compressed air]. This one here uses about 70,\u201d Folts says, pointing toward a tower gun from the early 2000s that stands about 15ft tall and, unlike the ground guns on Blue Ribbon, can\u2019t be easily moved. Up the hill sits a newer model that can get by on closer to 40 cubic feet a minute, or CFM, and a bit further down the slope is the resort\u2019s latest tool, which under ideal conditions can use as little as 10. That\u2019s a roughly hundred-fold increase in efficiency. The state-backed Efficiency Vermont program urges resorts to swap in as many of the more efficient devices as possible. \u201cThat work got a real big boost in 2014, when we did the \u2018Great Snow Gun Roundup,\u2019\u201d says Chuck Clerici, a senior account manager at the organization. Before then, it had been doing a handful of sporadic replacements. The roundup retired 10,000 inefficient models statewide, and, overall, Clerici says snowmaking operations are now using about 80% less air than they used to. While Efficiency Vermont doesn\u2019t separate savings that are the result of snowmaking upgrades from, say, those tied to building improvements, it reports that its efforts to help ski resorts use less energy have saved more than a 1bn kilowatt hours of electricity between 2000 and 2022. That\u2019s nearly a million tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions or the equivalent of taking more than two gas-fired power plants offline for a year. \u201cThe bigger projects we\u2019ve had over the years have been snowmaking projects,\u201d says Clerici. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that many instances in the energy-efficiency realm where you can swap something that uses one-fifth of the energy.\u201d Standing next to the building that houses Bromley\u2019s air compressors, Cairns points to a concrete slab with two maintenance hole covers that once fed massive underground diesel tanks. \u201cUnderneath was fuel,\u201d he says. To his right is a large pipe marked where the carbon-spewing generators used to connect to the rest of the snowmaking system. Now it\u2019s cut off. Bromley is among the many snowmakers that have been able to eliminate, or drastically reduce, its dependence on diesel air compressors. Electrifying the job has also allowed some resorts to incorporate renewable energy. Bolton Valley, in Vermont, features a 121-foot-tall wind turbine. Solar panels now dot the hills of many others, including Bromley, which leases a strip of land beside its parking lot for a solar farm. The array produces more than half the power its snowmaking system consumes. America\u2019s snowmaking industry has been historically based on the East Coast, where natural snow can be especially elusive. But that\u2019s changing. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot more work out West,\u201d says Ken Mack, who works for HKD Snowmakers, one of the largest equipment manufacturers. One of the company\u2019s executives recently moved to Colorado to help meet demand. The snow guns that HKD sells currently may be reaching the limit of how little water and compressed air they use. \u201cWe\u2019re probably getting to a point where we\u2019ve gone as low as we can go,\u201d says Mack. That\u2019s required finding gains in other arenas. One step snowmakers can take, says Mack, is to better track how much energy they use, ideally in real time. He\u2019s in the midst of trying to help revive a metric called the Snowmaking Efficiency Index, or SEI. It\u2019s a measure of how many kilowatt hours it takes to put 1,000 gallons of water worth of snow on the hill, something Stanchek pioneered years ago but never quite took hold. (For reference, under ideal circumstances it takes about 160,00 gallons to cover one acre in 1ft of snow.) If publicly released, such data could provide transparency and allow ski areas to boast about their efficiency. That\u2019s particularly appealing given that sustainability and environmental stewardship are increasingly top of mind for consumers. But because SEI varies considerably from mountain to mountain, and by temperature, it will probably be most effective as a tool for resorts to compete against themselves, rather than each other. This year, Bromley\u2019s SEI ranged from about 23 in the warm, early weeks of the season to mid-teens when temperatures dropped. Cairns consistently tries to beat those numbers and can monitor them from his office. If the number ever spikes, he can search for an open gun, leaking water line, or other culprit. \u201cAnything below 20 is really good,\u201d Cairns says. \u201cSo we\u2019re trending the right way.\u201d A more revolutionary development in snowmaking is the move toward automated systems that can be operated almost entirely remotely. One obvious benefit is reducing the need to find people willing to schlep around a mountain in the dead of night, when temperatures can dip into single digits. More importantly, automation allows resorts to ramp snowmaking up and down quickly, which is particularly useful as global temperatures climb. Snowmaking can occur when the mercury drops to about 28 degrees F (though the process is optimal at about 22 degrees or fewer); a threshold Mother Nature sometimes crosses for only brief periods. When it does, resorts can take advantage with a press of a button, instead of having to spend the time dispatching a crew out to fire up all those guns. The ability to operate in shorter time windows also means less energy is needed to run pumps and compressors \u2013 and get people up and down the mountain. \u201cYou\u2019re done sooner,\u201d says Mack. Where it might take 100 hours to cover a trail, automation could cut that to 20 or 30. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a savings. But it also gives you a little bit of reserve if you need it.\u201d Europe is far ahead of North America when it comes to automation, in part because governments have subsidized the daunting expense of running electricity and communication lines across a mountain. The cost of installing the technology can quickly run into the millions and, without subsidies, the benefits for American ski areas have been limited largely to smaller mountains in warmer climates, such as in the mid-Atlantic, where it is vital to surviving. But bigger resorts in snowier locales, including Stowe, Stratton, and Sugarbush in Vermont and Big Sky in Montana, have been testing the equipment. \u201cThe future of snowmaking is definitely going to be automation,\u201d says Cairns. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of money, and nobody really wants to subsidize that yet.\u201d Bromley is testing one semi-automated gun that could avoid the wiring issue. It uses the existing compressed air supply to spin an internal turbine that creates just enough energy to run a small onboard computer. By monitoring the weather conditions, it can automatically adjust the rate of water and air flow to produce optimal snow. \u201cThose guns don\u2019t need any power,\u201d says Folts, as he finished adjusting the position of one gun and moved to the next. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of another next level.\u201d Until then, Folts and his crew lumber on into the night, one gun at a time. This story was co-published with Grist, a nonprofit media organization covering climate, justice, and solutions. It was updated on 20 March 2024 to correct the name of HKD Snowmakers."

            "content": "\u201cTo make a hamburger \u2013 just one burger \u2013 takes what to make?\u201d Mathieu Flamini, elite footballer turned biochemical entrepreneur, asks the question. The answer, it turns out, is 2,000 litres of water. \u201cInsane,\u201d he says. The passion, the elan previously shown in midfield for Marseille, Arsenal over two spells and Milan is in full flow as the Frenchman presents his designs for life. Flamini, who eats once a day, sips hot water in a Soho vegan cafe as he espouses the benefits of an environmentally friendly lifestyle. \u201cClimate and health are related,\u201d he says. Turning 40 next month, he last played top-level football for Getafe in 2019 but still talks and looks like an athlete. He is also a partner in GFBiochemicals, a leader in sustainable alternatives to oil-based products, with levulinic acid replacing fossil fuels ingredients in everyday products. Swapping renewables for fossil fuels is big business and Flamini was on the ground floor, starting up the business in 2008 soon after joining Milan. The company now works with multinationals seeking to decarbonise. A long road lies ahead towards worldwide safe levels of carbon. \u201cClimate change is being ignored,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we talk about countries like India and China, people can\u2019t exercise outdoors any more. Do we want to get there? \u201cPlastic? It is everywhere in the sea. Even if I don\u2019t care about the environment, babies are being born with microplastic in their organs. We cannot ignore it.\u201d He believes football can play its part in averting the environmental catastrophes that threaten the planet. Football? The sport of private jets, fast cars, air-miles-busting transcontinental tournaments and petrodollar-funded club ownership? The sport where Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, has partnered with Saudi Arabia and where Aramco, the world\u2019s largest oil company, is set to sponsor the governing body for $100m a year? Yes, football. Flamini is a frontman for Green Football Weekend, an initiative held this weekend \u2013 Sky Sports swapping their yellow for green, the BBC and TNT involved, too \u2013 that addresses the grassroots, involving schools in delivering the message that eating vegetarian food is helpful to the environment. Fans can download a cookbook featuring a Raheem Sterling cauliflower, potato and spinach curry recipe the Observer is told is particularly tasty. That eating vegetarian more often \u2013 though not necessarily exclusively \u2013 can counter the high level of carbon byproduct from mass-produced meat is a leading message. Small changes eventually equating to giant steps is the strategy. \u201cWe need to empower people,\u201d says Flamini. \u201cClimate change is a big and scary topic. If you are told you must save the world, you feel useless as an individual. You must break it down, tell them how they get impacted by pollution and plastics, with everyday things like shampoo and shower gel coming from fossil fuels. If you multiply people making a change by billions then you can make a big impact.\u201d One of the campaign\u2019s aims is to depolarise the issues of climate change that, to take the UK as an example, have become bogged down in battlegrounds such as London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone, low-traffic neighbourhoods and Labour\u2019s on-off pledge of \u00a328bn on green investment. Throwing the issue back to football takes the edge off the spikiness and the UK game has not been immune to climate change, considering flooding has severely affected schedules in the lower divisions this winter. \u201cOur game is being affected but we are not blaming anyone here,\u201d says Flamini. \u201cWe are bringing the table out and trying to make sense. Football \u2013 and sport \u2013 is one of the last things we have that can unite people, can address everyone, from rich to poor, people from every part of the world. Football needs to stand up for climate change. What can they do? Start finding solutions. Offsetting carbon is one of those solutions. But it\u2019s the minimum.\u201d With men\u2019s World Cups in North America in 2026, across three continents in 2030 and in Saudi Arabia in 2034, Flamini, on the environmental committee for the Paris 2024 Olympics, has more than a few ideas for the organisers. \u201cSourcing food locally, vegetarian options for the athletes and the fans, avoiding plastics, using products made more sustainably than from fossil fuels, trying to reduce transport. It\u2019s about integrating all those solutions into planning. It\u2019s a journey.\u201d His own path includes giving up pescetarianism when the Arsenal doctor Gary O\u2019Driscoll showed him high levels of mercury in his monthly blood tests; a Marseille childhood and a passion for diving had already told him the Mediterranean was full of pollutants. He freely admits he drove a sports car in the fleet of Ferraris that pulled into the Milanello training ground. \u201cTake a young kid who has grown up in a difficult area, and didn\u2019t always have food on the table, and imagine that the poor kid becomes a very rich athlete. That kid had a dream to play in front of hundreds of thousands of people and that became reality. He also had a picture of a sports car on his wall, it is very difficult to tell this kid he can\u2019t achieve that dream, too. \u201cThe footballer will probably have a sports car but he can do other things, like become a vegan, or offset his carbon, or create awareness through his platform. Maybe later he\u2019ll get an electric car.\u201d For Flamini, the Eurostar now takes the strain of a hectic business life shared between London and Paris for a previous private jet frequent flier. A commitment to the environment can make everyone hypocrites. \u201cWhat if you have family in New York?\u201d he says. \u201cYou cannot tell people to take the boat but when people have the choice, we want them to take the green option.\u201d If his approach to changing opinions in football and the wider business world is largely conciliatory and commercially minded he retains an admiration for the direct-action activism of Greta Thunberg and her ilk. \u201cIt\u2019s inspiring,\u201d he says. \u201cAt 12 or 13 I was kicking a football around. It\u2019s a message of hope and if you push the message to corporations \u2013 to football \u2013 those kids are the consumers of tomorrow. Guys, it\u2019s time to change.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-14T18:47:49Z",
            "content": "Nearly 15% of Americans don\u2019t believe climate change is real, a new study out of the University of Michigan reveals \u2013 shedding light on the highly polarized attitude toward global warming. Additionally, denialism is highest in the central and southern US, with Republican voters found less likely to believe in climate science. Using artificial intelligence, researchers analyzed over 7.4m tweets posted by roughly 1.3 million people on the social media platform X (previously Twitter) between 2017 and 2019. The social media posts were geocoded, and classified as \u201cfor\u201d or \u201cagainst\u201d climate change using a large language model, a type of artificial intelligence developed by OpenAI. \u201cOver half of the tweets we looked at simply denied that climate change was real, that it was a hoax,\u201d said Joshua Newell, co-author of the study and professor of environment and sustainability at the University of Michigan. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t surprising but it was disappointing, I would hope that more and more Americans would believe in climate change and the importance of addressing it.\u201d Donald Trump emerged as one of the most influential figures among climate change deniers. His tweets around a cold snap in Texas in December 2017, as well as his missives rejecting the 2018 IPCC report released at the Cop24 UN conference, were some of his most engaged social media posts among climate change deniers. \u201cPublic figures such as Trump are highly influential,\u201d Newell said, \u201cwhen they use these events to trigger disbelief in climate change among social media users.\u201d The findings are consistent with similar studies, such as the recent survey out of Yale University which estimates that as of 2023, 16% of Americans do not believe in climate change (about 49 million people). Acceptance and belief in global warming is most prevalent along the west and east coasts, correlating with those regions\u2019 high rates of Democratic voters. Still, clusters of denialism exist within blue states, like in the case of Shasta county, California. There, disbelief in climate change is as high as 52%, but statewide, less than 12% of California\u2019s population does not believe in global warming. \u201cIt comports with my understanding that there is a small but very vocal and active minority of the public that still denies the overwhelming evidence of human-caused warming,\u201d said Michael Mann, climatologist and geophysicist at the University of Pennsylvania, about the study. Last week, Mann was awarded $1m in a defamation lawsuit against conservative writers who called his pioneering climate change research \u201cfraudulent\u201d, comparing it to the work of a convicted child molester. In his book The New Climate War, Mann argues that scientists have to rebut the misinformation and disinformation promoted on social media by bad actors, \u201cnot because we\u2019re going to win them over, their ideological heels are dug in, but because they are infecting the entire social media space with myths, falsehoods and toxic anti-scientific sentiment\u201d, Mann said. Researchers\u2019 use of AI helped classify millions of social media posts that otherwise would be too time-consuming and expensive to conduct. Still, some skepticism remains regarding the ethics of using AI for research, as artificial intelligence has a documented history of bias, especially in facial recognition, highlighting the need for human vetting. \u201cIt\u2019s an intriguing new tool to use for these purposes,\u201d Mann said. \u201cBut its limitations must be kept in mind as it\u2019s an evolving technology.\u201d It is up to social media platforms to combat misinformation, and fact-check what the researchers call \u201cknowledge vulnerability\u201d. \u201cThere is proper action by the social media companies to monitor disinformation and to act accordingly,\u201d Newell said, referencing Trump\u2019s ban from X (then Twitter) following the January 6 insurrection. \u201cThese very powerful social media companies should consider similar strategies for misinformation regarding climate change.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-28T05:00:29Z",
            "content": "\u201cAre you exhausted today?\u201d political theorist Ajay Singh Chaudhary asks over video chat on a dark Friday afternoon. This is a question he is posing not just to me, but to you, too \u2013 and it\u2019s one he already knows the answer to. Most of us, the indicators suggest, would suggest we are. But Chaudhary argues this isn\u2019t just an individual problem: \u201cOur ecological life is exhausting, our social and economic lives are exhausting, even our individual lives are exhausting.\u201d This is one of the central arguments of his first book The Exhausted of the Earth: how you feel and the state of the world are connected. And, he argues, it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. \u201cYour exhaustion is not some random byproduct [\u2026] There is a class of people out there who cause your exhaustion, [and] it\u2019s not just Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk.\u201d Under capitalism, we are not all in it together. Executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research, an educational organisation for adult learners, Chaudhary\u2019s book is an accessible analysis of how climate and politics interact. Writing it was \u201clike a return to home\u201d, he says; his parents are natural scientists and it was drilled into him from a young age that the climate crisis was not being approached politically. Climate change is political but it\u2019s \u201cnot the imaginary politics of universal consensus,\u201d he writes in the book\u2019s pithy prologue, nor the \u201canti-politics of miraculous technological salvation\u201d. It\u2019s also \u201cnot the end of the world\u201d. Instead, it\u2019s a struggle between \u201cactually existing people over actually existing crises with actually existing differences, interests, and prospects. Climate change is about power.\u201d Politicians in the global north rarely talk this way. They think of climate as an \u201con/off switch\u201d. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re doing some climate\u2019\u201d, says Chaudhary, mimicking them, \u201c\u2018would you prefer we do nothing?\u2019\u201d. But there are two large clusters of \u201cdoing something\u201d, both of which Chaudhary examines. The first is what he calls \u201crightwing climate realism\u201d. This encompasses a \u201cbroad spectrum\u201d, from those who favour \u201cslower climate mitigation and adaptation\u201d to climate barbarism, but it\u2019s ultimately about concentrating, preserving and enhancing existing political and economic power. That is why Chaudhary is insistent that, when we think of climate policies, we must pay attention to plans for borders and policing, too. He considers Joe Biden a type of rightwing climate realist. Among the US president\u2019s most important climate policies is not just the Inflation Reduction Act but the US National Security Strategy, Chaudhary argues. \u201cIt is insanely jingoistic,\u201d he says. It describes, for instance, out-competing China. If that\u2019s the framework, he argues, we\u2019re doomed, \u201cbecause US-China cooperation is vital\u201d. Ultimately, rightwing climate realists know there will be \u201cinstability\u201d and \u201cthey are preparing for it\u201d. That they will be successful is not only \u201cplausible and possible, but probable,\u201d he says. That is why the second avenue of \u201cdoing something\u201d, composed of \u201cthe rest of us\u201d, is so important. Chaudhary advocates for \u201cleftwing climate realism\u201d, which accepts the science, not because it\u2019s a discipline \u201cbeyond impugning\u201d but because it\u2019s quite clear that there are ecological limits on this planet. We need a slower life, he argues; a circular economic system, where firms compete for the same amount of finite profit and the state dominates certain sectors. This will be good for the planet and for people, producing \u201ca world relieved from social, economic, and ecological despair and exhaustion\u201d. So how do we get on this \u201cfaster [\u2026] track to a slower life?\u201d Answering this question is one of the other main aims of Exhausted of the Earth. Chaudhary deploys a version of realism informed by thinkers such as Franzt Fanon (the title pays homage to Fanon\u2019s classic, The Wretched of the Earth, on the trauma of colonisation), Audre Lorde and philosopher Raymond Geuss. Each of them examine how to build up power and what methods of outreach will be most effective. The usual mechanisms alone \u2013 elections and demonstrations \u2013 are not enough, Chaudhary argues. If Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour wins the next UK general election, Chaudhary has \u201cvery little hope\u201d this will mean \u201cany appreciable change for climate issues\u201d, he says. Leftwing climate realists must think outside of the box, \u201cnot only to influence major parties\u201d but to build networks of people and groups beyond these traditional political spaces. Emotions can help with this because they are how people \u201crelate to the world\u201d, he says. But aside from ecoanxiety (an overwhelming disquiet about environmental crisis) and solastalgia (the distress caused by the environmental changes where you live, causing a kind of homesickness), how we feel, a more \u201cinchoate\u201d sense of exhaustion, is missing from a lot of climate texts, he says. \u201cI might feel exhaustion in a particular way \u2013 like burnout, that\u2019s very common for someone in my social position in a place like the United States,\u201d Chaudhary explains, \u201cbut someone else might be feeling it as pure bodily fatigue [and] someone else might be feeling it as \u2018my people have never had a chance to express ourselves\u2019.\u201d Tapping into this can unite people, he says. This makes a lot of sense. But halfway through reading Exhausted of the Earth, I wonder whether it could also be demobilising? If we\u2019re uniting over how exhausted we are, might we end up deciding we\u2019re too exhausted to do anything about it? No, Chaudhary argues \u2013 exhaustion is just the stage for action, and then we have to coordinate and build from this shared feeling. In the global north, the right understands this far better than the left, organising in churches or radical right cells that are deeply emotional. But the left can learn alternative strategies of organising by looking around the world for inspiration. Chaudhary cites examples including the Muslim Brotherhood, who he says create support and connection by building clinics, fixing people\u2019s phones or helping when they\u2019re behind on rent. Movimiento al Socialismo in Bolivia, which is \u201cless a classic, formal party than a sometimes tightly, sometimes loosely bound set of social movements\u201d. Socialists, indigenous groups and intellectuals are all involved and they have radically transformed society, including providing the conditions for the Cochabamba Agreement, \u201cprobably the most radical official transnational climate politics document ever produced,\u201d he says. Too often in places such as the UK and US, the left have an idealised vision of an industrial worker who will be the agent of change and a rosy vision of returning to the postwar welfare state model. Chaudhary cites the work of eco-modernists Leigh Phillips and Matt Huber, whom he critiques among other things for \u201ctreating 2024 as 1924\u2019. Now production is flung all over the world and climate is inherently a cross-border issue \u2013 so we must think and organise internationally, he argues. Born in the Bronx, living in New York\u2019s most diverse borough, Queens, and from a Jewish and Indian background (he describes himself as a \u201cred diaper grandchild\u201d of sorts), he knows international solidarity not only feels good but is necessary. And this requires another kind of realism \u2013 understanding what might appeal to the greatest number of people globally, from peasants in the global south to farmers in the global north. It\u2019s unlikely, he says, that we\u2019ll get communism or socialism in the next 10 years \u2013 a small farmer in Iowa \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to obliterate private property\u201d. But we can get \u201csome pretty good stuff\u201d through \u201cdecommodifying many of the key pillars of socioeconomic life and creatively working within ecological constraints\u201d, even if \u201cwe\u2019ll probably still have basic market mechanisms for some things\u201d. If some of this sounds like triangulation, he insists it isn\u2019t. \u201cIn between meaningless reform and impossible revolution,\u201d he writes, \u201cwe find mixed existing and historical models of formal state, civil, and guerrilla strategies.\u201d Knowing what will appeal to the greatest number of people, then, doesn\u2019t just amount to watering down your approach. Realism moves politics from the realm of morality to efficacy, not in the sense of just working in \u201cthe system\u201d but figuring out \u201cwhere the power is going to come from to get these changes through\u201d. What, we should ask, is strategically necessary to achieve this different world. This includes, Chaudhary argues, refusing to shy away from violence \u2013 from the interpersonal through to the destruction of property. We are already living in a capitalist world that is violent in all kinds of ways, he says: communities destroyed by the changing climate and people eking out a living in endless precarity. And it would be ridiculous to believe that \u201cfossil capital\u201d will simply give in, he says \u2013 instead, it will inevitably deploy state and private violence to ensure its interests are protected. Steeped in critical theory, Chaudhary is wary of instrumentalism. But with the climate crisis, he realises there is now no other option: \u201cI am forced into self-defence\u201d; \u201csabotage\u201d, \u201cblockades\u201d, and \u201cyes, just straight up violence\u201d. He points to precedents such as the suffragettes in the UK, Martin Luther King\u2019s movement in the US and Gandhi in India, all of which involved both planned and spontaneous acts of violence. But he is not arguing violence should be the \u201cprincipal mode of struggle\u201d \u2013 rather, that leftwing climate realism has to \u201cwork across a host of terrains\u201d to be successful, including sports clubs, art movements or government. Much of what he\u2019s talking about might be \u201cquite radical\u201d, he admits, but it should not be \u201cverboten\u201d. The climate crisis is \u201cnot the apocalypse\u2019, he says. Billions will die but the world will not end. \u201cThere is not going to be a moment that it clicks and fire falls from the sky and you realise, \u2018Ah, the climate has changed\u2019. It\u2019s already happening.\u201d And what we do about it is up for grabs. The Exhausted of Earth by Ajay Singh Chaudhary (Repeater Books, \u00a314.99).

            "date": "2024-02-25T11:00:57Z",
            "content": "The Knepp estate in West Sussex is home to the first white stork born in the wild in Britain for over 600 years. It\u2019s a place where endangered bats, turtle doves and nightingales are thriving, where \u201cofficially extinct\u201d large tortoiseshell butterflies are breeding and where tens of thousands of people visit each year to experience \u201ca story of hope\u201d about the resilience of nature in the face of the global climate emergency. There have been many exciting changes at Knepp since 2018, when Isabella Tree wrote Wilding, her award-winning book about rewilding an unprofitable 3,500-acre arable and dairy farm. Now she has written a captivating illustrated book, Wilding: How to Bring Wildlife Back \u2013 An Illustrated Guide, updating her readers about extraordinary developments at Knepp and offering practical advice about rewilding their own spaces, however small. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a world of eco-anxiety and most of us, I guess, stick our heads in the sand because these problems are so enormous,\u201d says Tree. \u201cHow is one individual going to make a difference to climate meltdown and biodiversity? \u2018It\u2019s impossible,\u2019 you think. Then you come to Knepp and you see what nature has done, how it\u2019s rebounded in 20 or so years. It really is such a story of hope that I think people find it quite galvanising. It restores your energy and your belief that you can do something.\u201d The book, out on 7 March and is aimed at older children (aged 9+) and adults, explains how and why Tree and her husband, Charlie Burrell, sold off their dairy cows and farm machinery in 2000. They stopped ploughing and spraying fertilisers and pesticides, pulled up their barbed wire fences, smashed their Victorian land drains, quit clearing their ditches \u2013 and \u201csimply let things go\u201d. \u201cWe wanted to work with nature for a change, rather than fighting against it all the time,\u201d writes Tree. Exquisite illustrations by the printmaker and fine artist Angela Harding reveal how, step-by-step, wilderness and wildlife then returned to Knepp. \u201cNature bounces back, if you let it, wherever it can.\u201d Some of the rarest creatures in Britain have now made Knepp their home, including kingfishers, hazel dormice, scarce chaser dragonflies and purple emperor butterflies. The river has returned to its natural course and the soil is now storing as much carbon per hectare as a 25-year-old plantation of trees does, according to recent tests. \u201cThat\u2019s really exciting, because rewilding has been seen as fantastic for wildlife and recovering biodiversity, but people say it doesn\u2019t answer the problem of climate change. We can say now, categorically, it does. That, actually, you can restore your soils by allowing an area to rewild \u2013 and just the soils alone will be the same as a carbon storage in a plantation.\u201d This comparison is important, Tree says, because putting trees in the ground with a spade is not good for biodiversity. \u201cWhat you\u2019re creating as a single generational plantation with standing trees is a closed canopy woodland, which is very species poor.\u201d By contrast, Knepp has wetland, scrubland, mature trees and deadwood, as well as mycorrhizal fungi and root systems under the ground. \u201cAll of that is way more significant for storing carbon than just planting trees.\u201d Yet, in 2000, Knepp was merely an \u201cunpromising piece of land underneath the Gatwick stacking system\u201d. \u201cIf it can happen here, it can happen anywhere.\u201d The release two years ago of a pair of breeding beavers was particularly important: last year, they had two kits, the first to be born in the wild in Sussex for centuries. \u201cSeeing what the beavers have done during all these storms and floods is astonishing \u2013 they\u2019re holding back probably four or five acres of standing water and helping to prevent flooding downstream.\u201d During the 2022 heatwave, the beavers\u2019 dams created something similar to a \u201clittle emerald oasis in the middle of an African savannah\u201d, which is now \u201cheaving with life\u201d. Tree says: \u201cIt\u2019s absurd we still have to have beavers under licence in enclosed pens in England, when they\u2019re living free in Scotland and on the continent. Everyone knows how powerful they are for cleaning polluted water and restoring biodiversity.\u201d She and Burrell have been campaigning to \u201cget beavers back in England\u201d for 15 years: \u201cWe\u2019re so risk averse in the UK, while the planet is in meltdown. We\u2019ve got to get braver and start reintroducing the keystone species that are crucial to restoring nature.\u201d Wild-living beavers were recently given protected status in England, but farmers are concerned that reintroducing the native species \u2013 which was hunted to extinction in the 16th century \u2013will threaten their crops or livestock, for example by redirecting rivers and flooding agricultural land. Similarly, critics of rewilding argue that the government\u2019s decision to offer farmers incentives to rewild their land, in order to restore 741,000 acres of wildlife habitats in England by 2042, is putting food security at risk, when the UK is already heavily reliant on global food supply chains. \u201cPeople say we can\u2019t rewild everywhere \u2013 how are we going to produce food? That\u2019s the big pushback we\u2019re getting against nature, certainly from the National Farmers\u2019 Union,\u201d says Tree. While she accepts that not everywhere can be rewilded \u2013 \u201cwe will always need land for food production\u201d \u2013 she thinks that it can protect crops and provide farmers with a \u201clife-support system\u201d they desperately need. \u201cWe cannot carry on ploughing and using chemicals and artificial fertiliser. We know the pollution that causes, we know we\u2019re losing our soils. So, for the long-term security of food production itself, we\u2019ve got to shift to regenerative agriculture. But also we need to have rewilded areas around our food production to provide the dung beetles, the pollinating insects, the pest control, the clean water, the water storage and the buffers against extreme weather events.\u201d Surrounding agricultural land with wild land is the only sustainable way forward. \u201cRewilding works hand in glove with food production. We can have both,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the space for both.\u201d Wilding: How to Bring Wildlife Back \u2013 An Illustrated Guide by Isabella Tree and illustrated by Angela Harding will be published by Macmillan on 7 March"

            "date": "2024-02-15T18:17:46Z",
            "content": "Rumours that Russia is planning to deploy nuclear weapons in space have been dampened down by experts who say that while such technology is possible, there is no need to push the panic button. The furore kicked off on Wednesday when the head of the US House of Representatives\u2019 intelligence committee, Mike Turner, called for the Biden administration to declassify information on what he called a \u201cserious national security threat\u201d. While Turner gave no further details, it was later reported by news outlets, citing unnamed sources, to involve Russia\u2019s potential deployment of a nuclear anti-satellite weapon in space. The Kremlin dismissed the claim as a \u201cmalicious fabrication\u201d. Dr Bleddyn Bowen, an associate professor at the University of Leicester who specialises in outer space international relations and warfare, said the the lack of detail was no reason to panic. \u201cIt\u2019s so vague and cryptic, it could be a number of different things. [But] no matter what they are, none of them are a big deal, to be honest. Everyone needs to calm down about this.\u201d Russia is bound by several legal restrictions regarding the use or presence of nuclear weapons in space. Article 4 of the Outer Space treaty (1967) bans nuclear weapons from being put into orbit, installed on celestial bodies or otherwise stationed in outer space, while the New Start treaty aims to reduce the number of deployable nuclear arms. The Partial Nuclear Test Ban treaty (1963) bans nuclear explosions in space. Even if Russia ignores these agreements, there are other considerations. Bowen said the rumoured threat may relate to nuclear-tipped anti-satellite weapons but that such a threat was nothing new. \u201cThese are the first and the most crude kind of anti-satellite weapons ever built: the Americans had them in 1959.\u201d He said any state with nuclear weapons already had the technology to use them in space, broadly speaking. Another possibility, Bowen said, was that the threat related to space-based nuclear weapons that could be used to knock out satellites. Again, the idea is not entirely new: Russia has previously explored the stationing of nuclear weapons in space, albeit to attack ground targets. \u201cThey did this in the 1960s and in the 1970s and found out it\u2019s not actually very useful, and it\u2019s very expensive.\u201d He said the country stopped short of attempting to put nuclear bombs in space. Bowen said a nuclear bomb detonation in low-Earth orbit would create a flash in the sky, visible to those in the vicinity below, while it is likely there would also be a false aurora similar to the northern lights \u2013 as occurred during the high-altitude nuclear test known as Starfish Prime in the 1960s. Such a detonation would be certain to destroy the desired satellite, with less of a need for accuracy \u2013 and Russia does have nuclear weapons to spare. Yet there are drawbacks. Space-based nuclear weapons are vulnerable to attack from other nations, while the damage from such weapons would be indiscriminate. \u201cWhen you detonate a nuclear weapon in space you generate the fireball \u2026 but what you [also] generate is the electromagnetic pulse which fries the electrical circuits of anything that\u2019s unshielded within a few thousand kilometres\u2019 radius,\u201d he said. The pulse may also knock out power grids on Earth if the bomb is detonated above or near populated areas. \u201cAfter that, you have the radiation that the bomb would generate,\u201d Bowen said. Over time it would fry the electrical circuits of satellites in the wider part of Earth\u2019s orbit. The loss of satellite services could affect myriad systems on Earth, from telecoms to satellite navigation services. \u201cThat can have knock-on effects to the economy, to critical infrastructure, to the financial system, which relies on these satellites.\u201d In other words, while nuclear bombs could take out a desired satellites, they could also damage Russia\u2019s technology and interests. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be in a very desperate situation to want to do something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I am not losing any sleep over this.\u201d Russia also has other technology to hand. In 2021 Russia tested a direct-ascent anti-satellite missile, successfully knocking out one of its own defunct satellites. But James Green, a professor of public international law at the University of the West of England, said he was also dubious that that system would be deployed. \u201cI think Russia likes to project its space power [to appear] greater than it probably is,\u201d he said."

In his statement, Turner, an Ohio Republican, gave no details about the supposed security threat. Talking to reporters at the White House later on Wednesday, the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, expressed surprise at Turner\u2019s statement saying he was due to meet the \u201cgang of eight\u201d (congressional leaders with special security clearance for classified briefings) on Thursday. But Sullivan did not give any details of the planned meeting. ABC News and the New York Times cited unnamed sources as saying that the security threat Turner was referring to involved Russia\u2019s potential deployment of a nuclear anti-satellite weapon in space. The New York Times said US allies had also been briefed on the intelligence, which was not deemed to represent an urgent threat, as the alleged Russian capability was still in development. It is not clear whether the new intelligence alert is connected to a Russian launch on 9 February of a Soyuz rocket carrying a classified defence ministry payload. \u201cRussia has been conducting several experiments with manoeuvring satellites that might be designed to sabotage other satellites,\u201d Hans Kristensen, director of the nuclear information project at the Federation of American Scientists, said. He pointed out that any such deployment of nuclear weapons in space would violate the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, to which Moscow is a signatory. \u201cThe issue is not so much about an increased nuclear weapons threat per se but that it would increase the threat against other countries\u2019 space-based nuclear command and control assets. It would be highly destabilising.\u201d Pavel Podvig, an expert on Russian nuclear forces, said: \u201cI am very skeptical (to put it mildly). Unfortunately, it\u2019s impossible to categorically rule out anything these days. But still, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s plausible.\u201d Kristensen suggested that a Russian threat to put nuclear weapons in space, thus destroying yet another non-proliferation treaty, could be the latest in a long line of Vladimir Putin\u2019s moves designed to add to pressure on the US and its allies to end their military support for Ukraine. Daryl Kimball, the head of the Arms Control Association, said a nuclear anti-satellite weapon made little practical sense. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a nuclear weapon to blow up a satellite in orbit. All objects in space are so delicate, that you can do something with much less than a nuclear detonation,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s completely illegal.\u201d The House speaker, Mike Johnson, said there was no need for panic over the alleged, unnamed threat. He said he was not allowed to discuss classified information but told reporters: \u201cWe just want to assure everyone steady hands are at the wheel. We\u2019re working on it and there\u2019s no need for alarm.\u201d"

            "content": "In his memoirs published in 1996, Mikhail Gorbachev denounced the deployment of Soviet SS-20 missiles in the late 1970s as \u201can unforgivable adventure, embarked on by the previous Soviet leadership\u201d, adding that they \u201cmight have assumed that, while we deployed our missiles, western countermeasures would be impeded by the peace movement. If so, such a calculation was more than naive\u201d. Despite the best efforts of the Greenham women to prevent it, deployment of cruise missiles went ahead as planned, paving the way for the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which eliminated both cruise and the SS-20s. This multilateral deal could never have happened if their campaign for unilateral UK nuclear disarmament had succeeded. Rebecca Johnson (Letters, 30 January) appears to have forgotten that this conclusion was shared across the political spectrum. As the Observer stated in an editorial on 20 September 1987: \u201cThink back to 1979, when Nato settled on its \u2018twin-track\u2019 decision to deploy cruise and Pershing-2 missiles in Europe while continuing to negotiate with the Russians about the elimination of such systems. If the Soviet Union had then offered, inconceivably, to eliminate all its intermediate and short-range missiles aimed at western Europe in return for the non-deployment of cruise and Pershing-2, the offer would have been greeted with disbelief \u2013 and joy. Yet that is the very outcome that has now been achieved by deployment and negotiation: the twin-track decision has achieved its objective. \u201cNow is the moment for those who stood firm in 1983 \u2013 the year of deployment \u2013 to enjoy the results of their resolution. Despite public agitation and the parading of conscience through the streets, Nato was not deterred. Who would now have the nerve to claim that if the prescription of the peace groups had been followed the outcome would have been as good? The deal is a triumph for toughness and realism in international relations\u201d. Sir Julian Lewis MP Chairman, defence committee, 2015-19"

            "date": "2024-02-27T15:34:24Z",
            "content": "The Welsh government\u2019s cabinet did not discuss the threat posed by Covid as the virus spread across the world until a month after its chief medical officer had warned there was a \u201csignificant risk\u201d it would reach Wales, the inquiry into the pandemic has heard. At the start of three weeks of hearings in Cardiff, the inquiry was told this was more than three weeks after the UK government\u2019s cabinet debated Covid, with bereaved families describing this delay as a missed chance to \u201carmour up for battle\u201d. The Labour-led government was also accused of \u201ca massive failure of infection control\u201d when it allowed patients to be discharged from hospitals into care homes without being tested. It was suggested that first minister Mark Drakeford\u2019s administration should have banned mass gatherings sooner. The Welsh leg of the UK Covid inquiry began with a moving film in which families described losing relatives to the virus and survivors revealed how it had affected them. One told how her husband had begged her not to take him to hospital because he would be infected. Others recalled how loved ones had died trapped in Covid wards, separated from families. A person with disabilities told how his mental health had been affected because he felt he was being \u201ckept in prison\u201d during lockdowns. Others expressed distress that they had not been able to organise proper funerals. Tom Poole KC, a counsel for the inquiry, said the number of Covid deaths in Wales was more than 12,300. \u201cThat is by any measure a shocking figure and a terrible loss of life,\u201d he said. Poole said people from deprived backgrounds, people from ethnic minorities or with disabilities, older people and women in Wales had been disproportionately affected by Covid. Detailing the chronology of the pandemic, Poole said on 24 January 2020 the Welsh government was warned by its chief medical officer, Frank Atherton, that there was a \u201csignificant risk\u201d Covid would reach Wales. The UK cabinet discussed it on 31 January but the Welsh cabinet did not do so until 25 February. Poole said: \u201cDoes the fact that Covid was not discussed by the Welsh cabinet throughout January indicate that the threat posed by the virus was not taken as seriously as it ought to have been or that the Welsh government thought the UK government had things under control and there was no need to take independent action? Was there a lack of national strategic leadership and coordination from the Welsh government in this crucial early period?\u201d He said Welsh Labour called off its spring 2020 conference but was still prepared to allow 70,000 people to gather in Cardiff for a Wales v Scotland rugby game on 14 March. The game was eventually cancelled by the Welsh Rugby Union but not until 20,000 Scottish rugby fans had arrived in the Welsh capital. He said two concerts by the Welsh band Stereophonics also went ahead. Poole said: \u201cGatherings were not without some risk and a ban would have reinforced other social distancing good practice.\u201d The barrister said more than 1,000 Welsh patients were discharged from hospital to care homes without a test during March and April 2020. He said: \u201cThere is no doubt there has been a massive failure of infection control contributed at least in part to the influx of infected but untested patients.\u201d Later in the pandemic, the Welsh government imposed different restrictions to England. Poole said: \u201cWe will examine the extent to which divergence was based on proper advice \u2026 whether points of difference were substantive or merely cosmetic.\u201d The issue of politicians\u2019 WhatsApp messages disappearing has cropped up during the inquiry. Poole said text or WhatsApp messages from ministers \u201cshed light\u201d on some key decisions. He said there were instances when informal communications from Welsh politicians had been deleted and said: \u201cThe inquiry will wish to know why and how such messages are now not available for inspection.\u201d Nia Gowman, a barrister for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru group, told the inquiry that the then Welsh health minister and now first minister candidate, Vaughan Gething, and a senior adviser to Drakeford used the disappearing messages function on WhatsApp during the pandemic. Gowman said: \u201cThe limited messages which have been disclosed clearly show WhatsApp and text messages used to discuss government business where they shouldn\u2019t have been. They show Welsh government senior special advisers suspiciously and systematically deleting communications. They show special advisers reminding themselves and others that they had agreed to clear out WhatsApp chat once a week.\u201d Andrew Kinnier KC, for the Welsh government, said: \u201cNeither Welsh ministers nor senior officials used WhatsApp or any other form of informal communication as a substitute for or a supplemental means of decision-making.\u201d"

The Pantex site in Amarillo in north Texas announced on Facebook that staff should come to work for normal shift operations after it had paused operations. \u201cThe Pantex Plant is open for normal day shift operations for Wednesday, February 28; all personnel are to report for duty according to their assigned schedule.\u201d The plant updated that there was no fire at the plant site, NBC News reported. There is an unconfined fire north of the plant. Since 1975, Pantex has been the US main assembly and disassembly site for its atomic bombs. It assembled the last new bomb in 1991. In the time since, it has dismantled thousands of weapons. Pantex is located 30 miles (48km) east of Amarillo. With unseasonably warm temperatures and strong gusts helping to fuel the flames through dry grasses, the largest Texas blaze, known as the Smokehouse Creek fire, has consumed more than 500,000 acressince it ignited on Monday, and remains 0% contained. Two others had collectively scorched more than 38,000 acres and were each 20% contained. The wildfire is now the second-largest on record in Texas, CNN reported. Mandatory evacuations were issued in Texas on Tuesday afternoon as wind-swept wildfires continued to burn uncontrollably across the Panhandle. \u201cThere has been some structure loss,\u201d said public information officer Juan Rodriguez, who added that it\u2019s too soon to know how many buildings have burned. Rodriguez said high winds are complicating the efforts, even though there\u2019s hope for higher humidity on Wednesday. As of Wednesday morning, Texas officials are still determining the extent of damage as firefighters work to contain active fires. More than 4,000 homes in Texas are also without power as of Wednesday, poweroutage.us reported. Gusts of up to 65mph and low relative humidity are contributing to critical fire weather conditions and they are not expected to calm soon, according to the National Weather Service. Millions of people across the south-central US remain under red flag warnings. \u201cStronger winds are anticipated today, and conditions will remain quite favourable for the start and spread of wildfires,\u201d the NWS in Amarillo, Texas, wrote in an update on Tuesday, before urging residents to take extra caution with activities that could cause new ignitions. Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, issued a disaster declaration for 60 counties across the region under threat from the fires, stating that additional counties may be added as conditions intensify. The state\u2019s division of emergency management has also been enlisted to provide resources and aid local firefighters in the response. Encouraging Texans to keep their loved ones safe and thanking first responders, Abbott also shared warnings from Texas A&amp;M forest service that risks were high for fires beyond the Panhandle, in regions of the South Plains, Texoma, Permian Basin and portions of east Texas. The Smokehouse Creek fire, already the fifth largest in the state\u2019s history, burned more than all the fires ignited in Texas last year combined, according to the Texas A&amp;M forest service. Several communities were forced to flee, in some cases through chaos and confusion as the winds changed and exit routes were blocked by closed roads. Residents in the city of Canadian, a city in Hemphill county, were told to shelter in place on Tuesday afternoon, due to closures of important routes out of the city. \u201cThe wind has shifted from the north,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office for the town of Roberts posted on Facebook, adding: \u201cIf you have not evacuated, do so now.\u201d The city of Borger, in Hutchinson county, meanwhile, posted a plea for patience and instructions to remain off the roads as residents inundated the agency with questions. \u201cWe are trying to keep our pages as up to date as possible. Please understand that fire related situations are rapidly changing. This includes evacuations, active hotspots, and wind shifts,\u201d the city posted online. \u201cWe understand it\u2019s inconvenient for the roads to be closed,\u201d they added, \u201cbut there is active fire all over our roadways right now.

            "date": "2024-02-15T02:03:52Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s jobless rate jumped to a two-year high in January as employers barely added any jobs and more people started to look for work. The economy added 11,100 full-time jobs and shed 10,600 part-time roles, leaving a net gain for the month of just 500 jobs. The jobless rate last month was 4.1%, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. That result compared with economists expecting the rate to tick up to 4% from December\u2019s reported 3.9% with a net increase of 25,000 jobs. \u201cThis was the first time in two years, since January 2022, that the unemployment rate had been above 4%,\u201d said Bjorn Jarvis, ABS head of labour statistics. Part of the increase in the jobless rate was because more people started to look for work at the start of the year although the participation rate remained unchanged from December at 66.8%. \u201cOur labour market has been weakening but it has been weakening from a quite incredibly strong and resilient base,\u201d the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, told a media conference in Canberra. \u201c[W]e enter this period of economic uncertainty from a position of genuine strength and the labour market is a big part of that story.\u201d Labour market figures have been volatile in recent months, with November jobs jumping 61,500 only for 65,200 to be lost in December, according to preliminary numbers. Economists estimate the economy needs to add about 30,000 jobs a month to keep the unemployment rate steady as the population swells. The Reserve Bank will be watching today\u2019s employment figures as its assesses the impact of 13 increases of official interest rates since May 2022 that have lifted the cash rate to a 12-year high. RBA governor Michele Bullock told senate estimates earlier on Thursday:\u201cWe think we\u2019re in a good position to get inflation down in a reasonable amount of time while still keeping employment growing,\u201d she said. Hours worked in January fell by 49m, continuing a trend downwards since the middle of 2023. \u201cSince October 2023, the annual growth rate in hours worked has slowed considerably, down to 0.7% in January 2024, and well below the annual employment growth of 2.6%,\u201d Jarvis said. Investors viewed the labour market figures as further reducing the chances of another RBA interest rate rise. The Australian dollar was down about 0.1 US cents to 64.9 US cents and the ASX 200 share index extended gains for the day by about 0.1 percentage points to 0.9%. Lower interest rates make it less attractive to hold the Aussie dollar while also making it cheaper for firms to borrow. Prior to today\u2019s jobs figures, investors had fully priced in an RBA cut of 25 basis points in the cash rate to 4.1% by November, according to the ASX rates tracker. \u201cThe swift weakening in labour market conditions raises some doubts as to whether we will see an orderly easing in conditions in 2024,\u201d Sean Langcake, head of macroeconomic forecasting for Oxford Economics Australia, said. \u201c[P]olicy makers will be a little more concerned about the outlook after today\u2019s data.\u201d Sarah Tan, an economist with Moody\u2019s Analytics, said \u201ccracks are emerging in the Aussie labour market\u201d but forward indictors still pointed to \u201crobust employment demand\u201d. \u201cDecember survey data from the Australian Department of Jobs and Skills showed 20% of respondents were looking to bring on more staff over the next three months,\u201d Tan said. \u201cSome 5% were looking to trim their workforces, compared with 3% in November.\u201d Job vacancies also remained more than 70% above pre-pandemic levels with employers seeking about 400,000 workers. Population growth, though, was likely to exceed job generation, pushing the jobless rate to 4.5% by December, she said. New South Wales, the state that accounts for about a third of the economy, has dropped back to the pack with seasonally adjusted unemployment rate matching the national average at 4.1%. The state boasted a 3.4% jobless rate six months ago, compared with 3.7% for Australia overall. Victoria and the Northern Territory recorded the lowest unemployment rate at 3.9%, down from December\u2019s rate of 4% and 4.5%, respectively. Tasmania, where voters go to the polls for a state election on 23 March, saw its jobless rate jump from 3.6% in December to 4.5% last month. Queensland, which is also going to the polls later this year, has seen its unemployment rate edge lower, from 4.5% in July to 4.2% last month."

Since the 7 October Hamas attack that sparked a new war in the Gaza Strip, however, building work has come to an almost complete halt. The industry relied on approximately 80,000 Palestinian workers, who are now barred from entering Israeli territory. As a result, half-finished residential blocks are everywhere, yellow tower cranes waiting motionlessly overhead. In the West Bank, poverty rates have soared. The economic impact for Israel could also be severe. The finance ministry has estimated the expulsion of Palestinian construction workers is costing 3bn shekels (\u00a3656m) a month, and could eventually lead to a loss of 3% of GDP because the building and housing industries owe 400bn shekels in loans. But while Israel\u2019s divided government stalls on deciding whether to bring Palestinian workers back, an unexpected solution has been found as the fallout from the conflict ripples around the world: recruiting labourers from India. \u201cRight now I earn around 15,000 rupees (\u00a3150) a month,\u201d said Rajat Kumar, 27, from the north Indian state of Haryana. Though he has a bachelor\u2019s degree, for six years he had been unable to get any other job except construction, earning a salary he described as \u201cpeanuts\u201d. The prospect of travelling abroad to a country engulfed in conflict was a small price to pay for regular, well-paid work, said Kumar, who got his first passport in order to apply for a job as a plasterer in Israel. The job he has applied for in Israel would pay 138,000 rupees a month, with accommodation provided, which he saw as a small fortune. \u201cWhen I compare it with what I earn here, I can\u2019t think of anything but the better life I and my family will have,\u201d he said. A bilateral labour agreement was signed between Israel and New Delhi last May, before the war in Gaza broke out, but has since become a priority for both countries. Israeli transportation minister, Miri Regev, said during a visit to India earlier this month that Israel would be \u201clessening its dependence on Palestinian workers\u201d by replacing them with skilled foreign workers. With India suffering a chronic jobs shortage \u2013 overall unemployment sits about 8% and youth unemployment is almost at 25% \u2013 hunger for work in Israel has been huge, despite concerns over travelling to a conflict zone. Young men have turned out to recruitment drives across northern India in droves. On one occasion in Uttar Pradesh, more than 15,000 people arrived to hand in applications to work as plumbers, masons, electricians, carpenters and plasterers on Israeli construction sites. Some who travelled hundreds of miles, and waited for upwards of eight hours, were turned away. Kunal Silku, director of training and employment for the Uttar Pradesh government, said the state had received a direct request from Israeli authorities who wanted to recruit 10,000 labourers. Silku said the Israelis had specified they were primarily looking for steelworkers, tilers, plasterers and carpenters. \u201c Seven thousand and one hundred workers went through the screening and 500 have been selected so far,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are hoping to conduct more recruitment drives in the future.\u201d Relations between Israel and India were not always so friendly; the two countries only formally established relations in 1992. But today, India is a major Israeli arms recipient, and the Hindu nationalist government in power since 2014 sees the Jewish state as an ideological ally. According to Israeli daily Haaretz, Indian candidates seeking work in Israel were in many cases made aware that the jobs were not available to Muslims. The Israeli foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegation. \u201cWe would be more than happy to have the Palestinians back, but it\u2019s not our decision to make, and the situation is critical. Until that action is taken we need foreign workers,\u201d said Shay Pauzner, the deputy director general and spokesperson for the Israel Builders Association trade union. About 60,000 foreigners are expected to enter the Israeli construction industry over the next few months, he said. The majority will be from India, but Israel also has similar labour agreements with Sri Lanka and Uzbekistan, and has recruited from China, Moldova and Ukraine in the past. The recruitment drive has been met with some resistance by several Indian trade bodies. In a statement released in November, 10 trade unions said that any attempt by the government to \u201cexport\u201d Indian workers would show \u201cthe manner in which it has dehumanised and commodified Indian workers\u201d. The statement added: \u201cSuch a step will amount to complicity on India\u2019s part with Israel\u2019s ongoing genocidal war against Palestinians.\u201d This month, India\u2019s transport workers union also waded into the debate, stating that its thousands of workers would refuse to load or unload weapons bound for Israel \u201cin solidarity with Palestine\u201d. While better than standards in the Gulf, where the majority of Indian construction labourers work, Israel\u2019s building industry has a poor safety record by western standards. One rights group recently reported the number of people killed on Israeli construction sites is 2.5 times greater than that of the EU for every 100,000 workers. Nonetheless, recruitment among India\u2019s largely informal work sector appears to have been largely unaffected by the union\u2019s protests or safety concerns, and as of last week, the first Indian workers have begun arriving. Pauzner estimated that 400 people had already come to Israel after passing skills and qualifications checks. Vikas Dhanda, 33, from Panipat in Haryana, said he had applied for a job as a plumber in Israel. Doing the same work in India earned him just 17,000 rupees (\u00a3170) a month, which he struggles to survive on. After his wife died of a heart attack five years ago, he became the sole parent to his daughter and said he was determined to get the job to pay for her education. Any risks of going to Israel did not bother him, Dhanda added. \u201cI want to provide her with a good life and education,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat does it matter what kind of situation we will be sent to when the situation here is already terrible. We do not have many options. This job will pay 10 times more money and that puts every other concern aside.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-05T13:58:52Z",
            "content": "The first Monday of February is apparently the most popular day for employees to call in sick, so the timing of the latest labour market health check by Britain\u2019s number crunchers could scarcely have been better. According to the latest evidence the UK has an even bigger problem with inactivity due to long-term sickness than previously thought. Fresh figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest there are now 2.8 million people classified as not looking for work because of health issues \u2013 up from the 2.6 million previously estimated and a one-third increase on the 2.1 million before the Covid-19 pandemic. The ONS has rejigged its view of what has been happening to employment, unemployment and inactivity in order to take account of the fact the size of the UK\u2019s population has been revised up. Its tentative conclusions are that the labour market is bigger, sicker and tighter than the old data suggested. While the ONS was at pains to caution against reading too much into its new estimates, they show that employment is 170,000 higher than was thought but there are more prime age (16- to 64-year-old) people not working or looking for jobs, and long-term sickness now accounts for more than 30% of inactivity. Hannah Slaughter, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cTackling rising ill-health is a huge social and economic challenges that we\u2019ll be facing throughout the 2020s, as will getting the UK employment back up to and beyond pre-pandemic levels.\u201d The ONS view of recent short-term developments has also changed. It believes unemployment stood at 3.9% in the three months ending in November last year, lower than its previous 4.2% estimate. The Bank of England is closely monitoring the labour market for signs of an easing of pay pressure. Analysts said the new ONS estimates might make Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee more cautious about cutting interest rates. \u201cThe new figures show that the labour market is tighter than believed previously. Furthermore there is no evidence that conditions have loosened recently,\u201d said Philip Shaw of Investec. James Moberly of Goldman Sachs said: \u201cThe reduction in the unemployment rate suggests that progress on labour market rebalancing may have stalled, which has somewhat hawkish implications for the Bank.\u201d The reason the ONS warned against reading too much into the new data is that it lacks a complete picture of the labour market after suspending statistics from what had been its main gauge of developments \u2013 the Labour Force Survey \u2013 on the grounds that weak response rates made the results unreliable. The LFS was replaced by an experimental series based on a range of sources including the claimant count and PAYE data. It will take until September before the ONS is ready to announce its replacement for the LFS. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macro, said the ONS still had \u201clittle faith\u201d in the quality of its figures and was only willing to say that unemployment rate \u201cmay have fallen\u201d. He said more recent evidence, including rising redundancy notifications, showed rising unemployment."

            "date": "2024-02-13T13:24:01Z",
            "content": "Pay growth slowed less than expected in December, prompting predictions the Bank of England could start cutting interest rates later than previously expected. Earnings growth, excluding bonuses, fell only modestly to 6.2% in October to December 2023 from a revised 6.7% in the previous three months, as workers continued to bid up their wages amid skills shortages and a record number of people with long-term sickness. City traders, who had expected regular pay increases to drop more sharply to 6%, trimmed their forecasts of how much the Bank would cut rates this year. Policymakers at the Bank have signalled that pay rises will have to moderate before it cuts interest rates, otherwise rate cuts would risk allowing inflation to return later in the year. UK rate futures, which are used to gauge the likelihood of interest rate cuts, predict a reduction of just 0.69 percentage points this year, down from expectations last year that the central bank was poised to make cuts totalling 1.3 percentage points in 2024. George Buckley, the chief UK economist at Nomura, said a first cut in March or May, as financial markets previously expected, was now unlikely and that he was forecasting a delay until August. Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures on Wednesday showed annual growth in regular pay rises including bonuses was 5.8% in October to December 2023. City traders had expected this figure would fall to 5.6%. After wages were adjusted for inflation, the ONS said workers enjoyed a sixth month of real wage increases. Total pay rose on the year by 1.6% above the consumer prices index and regular pay rose on the year by 1.9% in October to December 2023. The Bank\u2019s decision on when to cut rates will be made more difficult by a fall in job vacancies for an 18th consecutive month and a slowdown in the growth of employment, which indicate the labour market weakened in the last months of 2023. A range of business surveys have shown annual pay rising in sectors with severe skills shortages. The jobs website Indeed said its employment tracker found that lower-paid categories such as childcare, cleaning and retail were among the most affected. It said many of these sectors were increasing pay before an increase of almost 10% in the national living wage due in April. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Indeed, said: \u201cElevated pay pressures in this segment of the labour market don\u2019t seem likely to abate soon.\u201d City workers and staff in the business services sector, which includes accountants, marketing executives and lawyers, saw their average pay growth fall below 7% for the first time in almost two years. In a sign that pay growth will slow further this year, a pay survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development found that employers were pencilling in 4% in the private sector and 3% in the public sector for the year ahead. Meanwhile, job vacancies declined to 932,000 in the three months to January, the lowest since mid-2021. Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said there were further signs of labour market weakness in the trends of employment growth and sickness rates. \u201cIt is clear that growth in employment has slowed over the last year. Over the same period the proportion of people neither working nor looking for work has risen, with historically high numbers of people saying they are long-term sick,\u201d she said. The ONS said it estimated 2.8 million people between 16 and 64 were not in the workforce because of ill health, a higher number than previously thought. The Health Foundation thinktank said the situation appeared to be getting worse. \u201cWith 688,000 more people out of the workforce since before the pandemic, 6.6% of 16- to 64-year-olds are now economically inactive for health reasons, a record high since 1993,\u201d it said. Jake Finney, an economist at the business advisory firm PwC UK, said the consecutive falls in the vacancy rate showed the heat was being taken out of the labour market. \u201cHowever, the lingering concern for the Bank of England will be that the labour market has not cooled sufficiently to achieve a sustainable return to the 2% inflation target. This remains one of the key barriers to the base rate cut in May that markets are currently expecting,\u201d he said. Jobs data has proved difficult to read since last autumn when the ONS suspended the labour force survey, which was used to measure key jobs market indicators such as employment and unemployment. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said he welcomed the rise in real incomes and low unemployment. \u201cIt\u2019s good news that real wages are on the up for the sixth month in a row and unemployment remains low, but the job isn\u2019t done. Our tax cuts are part of a plan to get people back to work so we can grow the economy \u2013 but we must stick with it.\u201d The TUC general secretary, Paul Nowak, said the government\u2019s efforts fell short of what was needed to reduce long-term sickness rates and raise wages in real terms to a level seen in 2008. \u201cAverage pay is still worth \u00a312 a week less than before the financial crisis 16 years ago and more than a million people are on zero-hours contracts. The Conservative legacy is low pay, ill health and more job insecurity,\u201d he added."

            "date": "2024-02-13T08:43:48Z",
            "content": "On the face of it, Britain\u2019s labour market is in rude health. Employment rose in the final three months of 2023 and unemployment fell to 3.8%. Earnings, adjusted for inflation, rose for a sixth successive month. All are traditionally signs of strength \u2013 not an economy that may well have been in recession in the second half of last year. Scratch beneath the surface and things look less rosy. The latest bulletin from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reveals that one reason the jobs market is running so hot is because of a lack of workers caused by long-term ill-health. The number of people inactive for health reasons was 2.8 million by the end of 2023 \u2013 a rise of more than 200,000 on the year and a jump of 700,000 since before the Covid pandemic. In a literal sense, this is a sick economy. The absence from the labour market of so many potential workers has consequences. There are still a high number of job vacancies, even though the economy has been flatlining for the best part of two years. While vacancies have been on a downward trend throughout this period, at 932,000 they are still above pre-Covid levels. Employers are also trying to plug the gap by employing more people from overseas. The number of UK-born workers decreased by 312,000 between the fourth quarter of 2022 and the fourth quarter of 2023, while the number of foreign-born workers rose by 405,000. Even so, the labour market remains tight and that is reflected in pay. As with vacancies, the rate of earnings growth is coming down \u2013 but not as quickly as the Bank of England and the financial markets have expected. Regular private sector wage growth \u2013 which is closely watched by Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) \u2013 was 6.2% higher in the three months ending in December than in the same period a year earlier. That was down from 6.6% in the three months to November but above the Bank\u2019s forecast of 6%. There are a number of obvious conclusions from the ONS data. One is that employers will oppose measures that would sharply cut the flows of migrant workers into the UK. A second is that there will be pressure on Jeremy Hunt to use next month\u2019s budget to announce measures to tackle long-term sickness. The chancellor may be tempted to tighten benefit rules but was warned against doing so by the Work Foundation, which said welfare cuts risked pushing those dependent on universal credit into low-paid insecure work that would make their underlying health conditions worse. More carrot, less stick was the advice from Ben Harrison, the thinktank\u2019s director. Finally, with private sector earnings growth still running above 6%, the rate-setting MPC is going to be more cautious about cutting interest rates. Wages will not be the only factor in deciding when and by how much borrowing costs come down this year but they are an important part of the mix."

            "content": "Every night, I am back in Russia. Last night, Mama and I were walking through a wet, springtime forest. We were going to bury the dead cat we carried in a box. I haven\u2019t been to Russia in two years. I went on assignment to Ukraine in February 2022, but there was no returning: in the eyes of the Russian state my work became a crime, which put my life in danger. My Russia now is only dreams and voices. The last time I saw my mother, it was just before the new year. She brought me a shawl \u2013 crimson, with asters and morning glory \u2013 and then she put on a song for my fiancee that went, \u201cAs long as there\u2019s no gays and wars.\u201d She doesn\u2019t want to come and live with me in exile. \u201cYou might not be able to live in Russia any more,\u201d she says, \u201cbut why should I have to give up my life? I want to live in my own homeland and to speak Russian.\u201d My mother keeps the TV on; she is afraid of silence. The TV is all about the Russian army\u2019s victories in Ukraine, about the un-patriots who get in the way of these victories, about how the Ukrainian army is shelling its own cities, and about the west, where life keeps getting worse. She also watches WhatsApp videos: everybody in Russia is on WhatsApp. Mama sends me links to old Soviet songs. Prayers, horoscopes, interior design. There\u2019s no war on WhatsApp. In Russia, you speak about the war only with those closest to you, the ones you love the most. New laws forbid the dissemination of any information that contradicts the official line (this carries up to 15 years\u2019 incarceration) and expressing negative feelings about the war (a fine for the first offence, then prison). Certain words are essentially forbidden: \u201cwar\u201d (you should say \u201cspecial military operation\u201d, \u201coccupation\u201d, \u201caggression\u201d, \u201cpeace\u201d. Informing is rife \u2013 people turn one another in after a fleeting conversation, or the wrong media channel is glimpsed on a phone screen, for wearing Ukrainian insignia, or posting on social media. But more than informing, people dread hearing something that makes further contact impossible. Some families are no longer on speaking terms; for others, topics of conversation have become off limits. When Mama and I talk about the war, we are soon shouting. It\u2019s easier with my sister. We both used to work for Novaya Gazeta, Russia\u2019s foremost independent newspaper. Then Russia attacked Ukraine, Novaya had its licence revoked and I quit, but Sveta stayed and is still working as a journalist, without any accreditation or pay, still living in Moscow. Her reality seems like a fever dream to me. One time, she was simultaneously trying to find a bomb shelter (Ukrainian drones approaching Moscow) and an air conditioning unit (summer was expected to be hot). When the paper closed she trained as a nurse, saying, \u201cNow I can always help, nobody will be able to stop me.\u201d Three times a week she changes wound dressings for homeless people. Many have turned to volunteering. Working for hospices, charities, hospitals and refugees \u2013 a collective outpouring of voluntary labour. You can also go to one of the monasteries, to plait camouflage nets and assemble trench candles. Everyone describes their motivation in the same words: \u201cTo keep from losing my mind.\u201d My mother says, \u201cI was thinking of going to the monastery to make camouflage nets.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re taking part in war,\u201d I tell her. \u201cDo you remember your teacher, Vera Grigorievna?\u201d she says. \u201cHer son was called up. I don\u2019t want Valera to get killed.\u201d Mama believes that nets knotted by careful fingers will hide them from death. My friend Denis\u2019s son was kidnapped. The boy went to pick up his passport and disappeared. The police had been waiting for him, and they spirited him away into the army. \u201cWhat if we kidnap him back?\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m scared of ending up behind bars,\u201d Denis says. \u201cI\u2019ve got a daughter too to look after.\u201d My friend Vika and her wife are also parents to a son, but families like theirs have been outlawed by Russia\u2019s supreme court for being part of what it called an extremist \u201cinternational LGBT public movement\u201d. This month the first convictions were handed out: a 1,000 rouble (\u00a38.69) fine; five days in administrative detention for wearing rainbow-coloured earrings. The maximum sentence is 15 years in prison. Vika\u2019s son is six now. She tells me how hard it is to convince a child that you have to lie. They only believe you if you believe it yourself, with all your heart. \u201cSo I\u2019ve made myself believe we have to,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I forced my wife to believe, too. And now we believe that families like ours shouldn\u2019t exist, and that\u2019s why we must hide.\u201d The authorities are constantly on the lookout for internal enemies \u2013 the ones you can blame, on TV, for messing up the victory. It\u2019s very hard to explain to a six-year-old what fascism is, Vika says. What repression is. What prisons and orphanages are. I tell Mama all this. Remember Vika? A few days later she calls me and says: \u201cI don\u2019t understand what this war is for.\u201d I say nothing. Mama says: \u201cOn TV, they\u2019re always saying \u2018victory, we need victory\u2019, but what is victory? Even if we conquer Ukraine, all we\u2019ll get is a country in ruins and a people who hate us. Ukrainians know how to hate, we\u2019ve taught them.\u201d I say nothing. Mama says: \u201cFine. What am I to do about it, then?\u201d And I say: \u201cMama, that\u2019s a really good question.\u201d The next day, in a maximum security prison beyond the Arctic Circle, they murder Alexei Navalny \u2013 political prisoner, patriot, anti-corruption activist and, in the hopes of many, the future president of a liberated Russia. The jailers declare that Navalny just dropped dead \u2013 \u201csudden death syndrome\u201d they say, while the TV adds helpfully that it was a blood clot. They\u2019re hiding his body, refusing to release it to his family. Across the country, people bring flowers to the memorials for political prisoners \u2013 it was possible to put up such memorials once upon a time. Police and caretakers clear the flowers away immediately, moving people on, taking their photos, sometimes detaining them. Four hundred mourners are detained in the first 24 hours, 46 in St Petersburg alone; some are incarcerated. Some of the memorials are cordoned off. They\u2019re telling people there are mines; they\u2019re cutting off every approach. And so people lay their flowers in the snow. They leave notes for one another: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d People keep coming, day after day. Flowers briefly blot out the snow.

            "date": "2024-02-08T06:35:29Z",
            "content": "Good morning. As the war in Gaza enters its fifth month, the push for a ceasefire has continued. Responding to Israel\u2019s proposals, Hamas has made a far-reaching counteroffer, which includes a four and a half month truce that would see the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, guarantee the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, and require the reconstruction of the strip, among other requirements. The Palestinian militant group also added that over the course of the temporary ceasefire, negotiations must continue to ensure a permanent end to the fighting. The US president, Joe Biden, said the requests were \u201ca little over the top\u201d. But the general consensus seemed to be that this was a step in the right direction. As expected, Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, rejected Hamas\u2019s terms, which he described as \u201cdelusional\u201d, and has dismissed pressure from the US to come to a mediated truce. As combat intensifies and Israel prepares to storm Rafah, a small town bordering Egypt that is currently housing more than half of Gaza\u2019s population, time is running low. With every passing day, the situation in Gaza becomes more untenable. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke with Bethan McKernan, the Guardian\u2019s Jerusalem correspondent, about how close negotiations are to a ceasefire. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories Pakistan | Two bomb blasts at the election offices of a political party and an independent candidate in south-west Pakistan killed at least 30 people and wounded dozens more on the eve of parliamentary elections that begin today. Politics | The father of the murdered teenager Brianna Ghey has demanded Rishi Sunak apologise after the prime minister made a jibe at the expense of transgender people just after being told Brianna\u2019s mother was watching him in the House of Commons. Coronavirus | The Conservative peer Michelle Mone assured the government that she was not entitled to \u201cany financial benefit whatsoever\u201d from a PPE company, five months before \u00a329m of its profits were transferred into a trust for her benefit, the Guardian can reveal. Police | Protesters who wear masks could face arrest, up to a month in jail and a \u00a31,000 fine under proposed measures that human rights campaigners claim are pandering to \u201cculture war nonsense\u201d. Demonstrators will also no longer be able to use the right to protest as a reasonable excuse if they commit public order offences such as serious disruption. Labour | Keir Starmer will announce today that he is scaling back Labour\u2019s \u00a328bn green investment programme, in his biggest policy U-turn since becoming party leader. In depth: \u2018We\u2019re still far off a meaningful deal where hostages are released and there is a real ceasefire\u2019 Two weeks ago, Israel announced a US-backed ceasefire plan that would entail a 45-day truce and the phased release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. In its proposal, Israel ruled out a permanent ceasefire in order to retain the right to continue the war to wipe out Hamas. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said it was a \u201cgood strong proposal\u201d and that \u201cthere is some real hope going forward\u201d. Here\u2019s what happened next. *** The counterproposal After deliberating, Hamas has come back with its own proposal that includes a three-phase ceasefire, with each stage lasting 45 days. In the first phase, all Israeli women, males under the age of 19, elderly people and the sick would be released in exchange for Palestinian women and children in Israeli prisons. During the second stage, the rest of the male hostages would be released in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. This would be followed by the exchange of bodies and remains in the final phase. The plans also include an increased flow of food and other aid, the reconstruction of Gaza, and retention of Hamas control in the strip. Hamas has said a permanent ceasefire is not required from the outset; however by the end of the ceasefire there would have to be some kind of agreement for a permanent truce before the release of the last hostages. *** Sticking points and compromise Even though some mediators viewed the counterproposal as a positive step, Israel\u2019s government unequivocally rejected its terms. Netanyahu reiterated his stance that \u201cabsolute victory\u201d against Hamas was the only solution that would secure Israel. He added that it would take months more fighting before Hamas was defeated. Despite Netanyahu\u2019s push back, Blinken has said there is \u201cspace for agreement to be reached\u201d. Any proposal that leaves Hamas in charge of Gaza will be deemed unacceptable by the Israeli government. \u201cIsrael has offered the leaders of Hamas to go into exile in the past, and that idea has recently been floated again, but Hamas will probably not agree to that,\u201d says Bethan. Then there is the issue of the prisoner exchange: in November, the Palestinian prisoners who were returned to Gaza were generally women and children who had been imprisoned for misdemeanour crimes or on trumped-up charges, but Bethan explains \u201cthis time Hamas has written a long list of prisoners they want released, including hardened militants who are serving life sentences\u201d, which is proving to be a point of contention. Although both sides are digging their heels in, they have also indicated there is room for compromise. \u201cThe length of the ceasefire, the amount of aid and goods allowed into Gaza and the way the hostage and prisoner release mechanism would work in practice\u201d are all areas either or both sides may be willing to move on, Bethan says. *** What\u2019s next? The outcome of these negotiations could not be more critical to the security of the region and the worsening of the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Pressure on Israel from the Americans to agree to a deal has increased, especially as they hope that a hostage and ceasefire deal will lead to a wider resolution in the Middle East. During the November ceasefire, Hezbollah stood down and stopped firing at Israel \u2013 whether that would happen again is unclear but there is still a chance that it could de-escalate hostilities between the Lebanese militia group and Israel. Bethan notes that it is unlikely to make much of a difference with the Houthis in Yemen, who \u201chad their own calculations and interests in mind when they got involved and are unlikely to stand down. They would need their own separate negotiations.\u201d The consensus among mediators is that this is the closest Israel and Hamas have been to a ceasefire since November; Bethan, though, is not as optimistic: \u201cWe\u2019re still really far off a meaningful deal where hostages and prisoners are released and there is a real ceasefire on the ground in Gaza.\u201d Ramadan, a period where tensions tend to flare up in the West Bank and Jerusalem, is also fast approaching \u2013 if a truce has not been declared before mid-March, hostilities could get even worse. However, a ceasefire deal that the Israeli government is not on board with could fling Netanyahu, who is deeply unpopular, into another political crisis. Bethan says the core problem on the Israeli side is that \u201cno one is willing to negotiate a two-state solution \u2026 The short-termist thinking is making these negotiations near impossible. How can you plan a ceasefire if you don\u2019t know what you want to happen in Gaza after the war is over?\u201d A truce based on the idea of all-out victory for Israel seems unrealistic even to its allies. While Israel can \u201cdegrade Hamas\u2019s capabilities and make Gaza completely uninhabitable, they are not going to kill Hamas as an ideology or political force\u201d, Bethan says. In the coming weeks, both sides are likely to continue to blame the other for the failure to reach a truce, as the death toll continues to rise.

            "date": "2024-02-29T16:45:59Z",
            "content": "The United Kingdom, February 2024. A cold wind blew down Whitehall. The streets were nearly empty. The shops boarded up. Just a few veiled women, keeping their heads bowed as they hurried home. Inside 10 Downing Street, the prime minister cowered under his desk. \u201cNo more,\u201d he sobbed. Over in City Hall, Sadiq Khan signed the death warrants of another 50 motorists who had failed to pay the Ulez charge. His original order had been that first offenders should only have both hands cut off, but he had been overruled by the ayatollahs. Sharia law should never be that lenient. In Threadneedle Street, Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, was pacing the vast boardroom. The woman he was expecting, the editor of the Financial Times, was late. On the table were laid out two bandanas and two suicide vests. In under an hour they \u2013 and Jeremy Hunt \u2013 would both be dead. Well, what would you do? After all that Jezza has done to the economy. The fight back of the deep state starts here. Still, the caliphate was expanding its reach. Down in the Cotswolds, Boris Johnson was being dragged through the centre of Chipping Norton. In an hour\u2019s time he would be stoned to death. The punishment for adultery. Let him be an example to other politicians. Up in the balcony of the town hall, David Cameron \u2013 AKA Lord Big Dave \u2013 allowed himself a wry smile. He would be throwing the first stone. Er \u2026 actually, scrub that intro. That was the Lee Anderson and Liz Truss vision of Britain on Monday. It\u2019s now Thursday. The United Kingdom, February 2024. A cold wind still blew down Whitehall. The streets were also still empty and the shops boarded up. And Rishi Sunak hadn\u2019t moved since Monday. Nobody had managed to talk him out from under his desk. Out on Oxford Street, a group of murderous terrorists had formed an orderly queue outside Selfridges. They claimed to be waiting for the shop to open so that they could buy the new Call of Duty video game. But Rish! knew better. He alone had attended the Cobra briefing led by Suella Braverman. Before long, some of the terrorists would be waving flags and walking somewhere else. Some might even be smiling and demanding \u201cpeace\u201d. Imagine that. It was the same throughout the rest of this once prosperous land. In the countryside, sheep were lying with donkeys and crops were rotting in the fields. The roads were unpassable, blocked by overturned cars and looted lorries. The sun no longer shone and beggars howled to the skies, their cries unanswered. Bodies lay unburied in the street. And still the mob demanded peace. James Cleverly was just the latest cabinet member to tiptoe into No 10 via the secret tunnel. It was far too dangerous for him to use the front door. He kept his head down in the corridors in case his movements attracted the attention of a sniper. He needed to coax the prime minister out. He hadn\u2019t been to the toilet for days. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Rish! sobbed. \u201cLeave me alone! Leave me alone!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d said Jimmy Dimly tenderly. \u201cIs it safe? Is it safe?\u201d \u201cIs what safe?\u201d \u201cIs it safe? Is it safe? The country has descended into mob rule. We no longer have a functioning government. By the way, who is the prime minister? And which party has been in power for the last 14 years?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know,\u201d said Jimmy D. \u201cBut I have a cunning plan. We\u2019re going to let everyone have three protests and then say: \u2018You\u2019ve made your point. Enough is enough. Time to go home now and everything will be fine.\u2019\u201d \u201cYou say all the sweetest things, Jimmy,\u201d said Rish!. \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be without you.\u201d Weirdly, this wasn\u2019t a line of reasoning that the security minister, Tom Tugendhat, chose to employ in his statement to the Commons on MPs\u2019 safety. In fact, he got through the whole hour without mentioning the words \u201cmob rule\u201d. Almost as if he was a bit ashamed by his leader. Embarrassed by him. You get the feeling that the end of this parliament can\u2019t come too soon for Tories like Tugendhat. Instead, Tugendhat just stuck to basics. MPs are increasingly under threat and need protection. No one was going to argue with that. Though he was understandably unwilling to think what might have prompted the surge in death threats. That it might have all kicked off with the coarsening of the debate during the Brexit years. Rightwing newspapers branding MPs and judges as traitors and enemies of the people. And the government just standing by in passive acceptance. Nodding it through. Back in Downing Street, Jimmy D was still trying to lure Sunak out. \u201cIt\u2019s the big annual Tory fundraiser tonight. The Black and White ball,\u201d Dimly explained. \u201cWe need to extract as much dosh as possible with the election coming.\u201d \u201cWhat have others given so far?\u201d squeaked Rish!. \u201cLet me see \u2026 Suella has offered a lifelong break in Rwanda. Stay in a two-star hotel. The advance bidding on that has been slow. And Honest Bob Jenrick is offering to help with controversial planning applications. Pornographers especially welcome \u2026\u201d \u201cAnd what are you giving?\u2019 \u201cA luxury five-night stay on the Bibby Stockholm, with a banquet dinner cooked by 30p Lee.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d \u201cIn which case I will offer an honorary knighthood. Preferably to someone linked to my father-in-law\u2019s business interests.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re all heart,\u201d said Jimmy Dimly. \u201cAll this giving is very tiring.\u201d"

            "content": "Late-night hosts talk prospects of peace in the Middle East, Donald Trump\u2019s new sneakers and Nikki Haley\u2019s loss in the South Carolina Republican primary. The Daily Show For his third monologue as the returning Monday night host for the Daily Show through the election, Jon Stewart took on the famously thorny topic of Israel-Palestine. The war, he noted, is \u201can awful situation. We\u2019re coming up on five months of a brutal bombing campaign brought on by a horrific massacre and hostage-taking, and we seem no closer to ending anything but the reign of a couple of Ivy League presidents.\u201d The host went hard on Israel, which has killed more than 30,000 people in Gaza in retaliation to the 7 October attacks and whose plan, according to its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is to continue bombing until Hamas is eliminated. \u201cYou\u2019re planning to eliminate Hamas by destroying all of Gaza?\u201d an incredulous Stewart asked. The group, he continued, is \u201can idea. Do you have a bomb that kills ideas? I mean, how long would it even take to bomb the shit out of an idea?\u201d As for the US, Israel\u2019s closest ally and \u201cwork emergency contact\u201d, Stewart had some advice: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time for the US to give Israel some tough moral love.\u201d While the US roundly condemned Russia\u2019s killing of civilians in Ukraine, he continued, US officials have tempered their criticisms of Israel, essentially asking them to be more careful with their bombs. \u201cCouldn\u2019t the United States have told Israel that when we gave them all the bombs?\u201d he wondered. \u201cThey\u2019re our bombs! This is like your coke dealer coming in with an eight ball and going, \u2018Don\u2019t stay up all night.\u2019 \u201cSo Israel, the United States, the United Nations, the Arab nations \u2013 no one seems to be incentivized to stop the suffering of the innocent people in this region,\u201d he concluded, before proposing three possible solutions. Two were jokes, of course, such as phoning God for input. But the final one was sincere: \u201cStarting now, no preconditions, no earned trust, no partners for peace: Israel stops bombing, Hamas releases the hostages,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Arab countries who claim Palestine as their top priority come in and form a demilitarized zone between Israel and a free Palestinian state. The Saudis, Egypt, UAE, Qatar, Jordan \u2013 they all form like a Nato arrangement guaranteeing security for both sides. Obviously, they won\u2019t call it Nato. It\u2019s the Middle East Treaty Organization \u2013 it\u2019s Me Too. \u201cObviously, I have not worked out the exact verbiage,\u201d he added, \u201cbut anything is better than the clusterfuck cycle we have now. Because honestly, what is the alternative?\u201d Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert celebrated the $355m penalty in Trump\u2019s New York civil fraud trial, which found him guilty of illegally inflating his assets, among other crimes. Because the ruling comes with back interest, Trump really owes the state of New York $454m. \u201cObviously, Trump needs cash fast. So he\u2019s getting into foot stuff,\u201d Colbert quipped, noting his recently launched \u201cNever Surrender\u201d limited-edition sneakers, selling for $399 a pop. \u201cYes, they are a bold fashion statement. It\u2019s like if King Midas touched a turd,\u201d Colbert joked. Trump also won the South Carolina primary over the weekend, though his one remaining rival, Nikki Haley, vowed to continue her long-shot campaign. \u201cI\u2019m grateful that today is not the end of our story,\u201d she told supporters in her home state. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right. This isn\u2019t the end \u2013 we\u2019re way past the end,\u201d Colbert corrected. \u201cThis is like the second or third post-credits scene in a Marvel movie where they hint at some character that no one\u2019s ever heard of.\u201d Seth Meyers \u201cTrump\u2019s election delusion has infected the entirety of the GOP,\u201d said Seth Meyers on Late Night, citing an exit poll from South Carolina in which only 32% of primary voters thought that Biden legitimately won the 2020 election. \u201cThe GOP is fully committed to the delusion that Trump won in 2020, and that delusion has short-circuited the normal mechanisms of politics,\u201d Meyers added. \u201cIn a healthy democracy, when one party keeps losing over and over, they would re-evaluate and become less extreme. But if you can just keep telling yourself lies about why you lost or that you never actually lost in the first place, you never have to change to appeal to voters.\u201d That\u2019s why, he continued, Trump continues to brag about being responsible for overturning Roe v Wade, despite the unpopularity of that decision, as evidenced by public outcry over a recent Alabama supreme court decision declaring IVF embryos \u201chuman beings\u201d with equal protection under the law. The South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, speaking on Fox News, evidenced the Republican position by trying to distance the ruling from the supreme court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe in 2022. \u201cSaying this has nothing to do with Republicans is like saying Dolly Parton\u2019s song Jolene has nothing to do with a woman named Jolene,\u201d said Meyers, \u201cwhich is another argument I\u2019m sure Lindsey Graham would be happy to make.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped the South Carolina primary, which contained some concerning stats for Trump; for one, Trump and Haley were near even among college-educated voters. \u201cTrump won by a large margin among voters without a college degree \u2013 he does well with non-educated voters,\u201d Kimmel explained. \u201cAbsolutely dominates among voters who have been hit on the head with a boulder or a falling brick.\u201d Haley vowed to continue her campaign, as she\u2019s \u201ca woman of my word\u201d. \u201cAnd that word is denial,\u201d Kimmel added. For anyone confused as to why she\u2019s still running, Kimmel spelled it out: \u201cIt\u2019s because the guy she is competing against has 91 criminal charges against him \u2013 in New York, in Florida, in Washington and in Georgia. That\u2019s why she\u2019s staying in it. It\u2019s like being Charlie Sheen\u2019s understudy in a Broadway play \u2013 pretty good chance you\u2019re getting on stage!\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-28T20:08:10Z",
            "content": "A last-minute push by anti-war activists to reject President Joe Biden over his unwavering support for Israel far exceeded expectations in the Michigan Democratic party primary on Tuesday night. Leaders from the grassroots campaign, called Listen to Michigan, said ahead of the primary that they would count 10,000 \u201cuncommitted\u201d votes \u2013 roughly Trump\u2019s winning margin in Michigan eight years ago \u2013 as a victory. Instead they surpassed that goal by an order of magnitude, earning the support of more than 100,000 Democrats who checked the \u201cuncommitted\u201d box, and 13% of votes overall. That should weigh heavily on Democrats, who could lose the pivotal state \u2013 and even the presidency \u2013 in November if these sentiments persist. Biden won Michigan by about 150,000 votes in 2020 \u2013 less than 3% of the overall vote. It remains to be seen how many of the Michigan voters who withheld their support from Biden during the primary will abandon the president in the general election, where he will most likely face former president Donald Trump, whose brash Islamophobia and policies targeting Muslims defined his 2016 campaign and early presidency. \u201cThis is a victory of American democracy,\u201d said former US congressman Andy Levin, addressing a crowd of Listen to Michigan supporters as the results trickled in last night. \u201cThere is no time to waste \u2013 we need a permanent ceasefire right now.\u201d In 2022 Levin, a progressive Jewish politician, faced a primary opponent in a new district and lost. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) spent more than $4m to support his opponent. Michigan is home to one of the largest concentrations of Arab and Muslim Americans in the US, many of them living in the greater Detroit area. Those voters formed an important part of the Democratic coalition in 2020, but their support for Biden has plummeted as the president continues to support Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza, which has claimed the lives of nearly 30,000 Palestinians in just five months. According to exit polling by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), 94% of Muslim voters who cast their ballots in Michigan\u2019s Democratic primary on Tuesday voted \u201cuncommitted\u201d. There are about 200,000 registered Muslim voters in Michigan. The \u201cuncommitted\u201d campaign formed quickly in early February with just weeks to spare ahead of the primary. Spurred by younger and Arab organizers, it was also supported by labor activists and progressive Jewish voters. Dozens of elected officials in the Detroit area and several national Democrats also registered their support. In a video posted to social media, Rashida Tlaib, the Palestinian American congresswoman representing Dearborn and Detroit, explained why she voted \u201cuncommitted\u201d. \u201cPresident Biden is not hearing us,\u201d said Tlaib, noting that according to recent polling, about 74% of Michigan Democrats support a ceasefire in Gaza. \u201cThis is the way we can use our democracy to say \u2018listen \u2013 listen to Michigan.\u2019\u201d In a New York Times opinion column that ran a week before the primary, the mayor of Dearborn, Abdullah Hammoud, who also backed the \u201cuncommitted\u201d campaign, described the \u201cvisceral sense of betrayal\u201d his constituents feel toward the Biden administration. \u201cPresident Biden,\u201d Hammoud wrote, \u201cis proving many of our worst fears about our government true: that regardless of how loud your voice may be, how many calls to government officials you may make, how many peaceful protests you organize and attend, nothing will change.\u201d But it isn\u2019t only Muslim and Arab American voters who the president stands to lose in the November general election. Biden\u2019s support among younger voters and Black voters, who formed key blocs in 2020, also threatens to collapse as the Israel-Hamas war, which has decimated Gaza, wears on. So far, the Biden campaign has barely registered a response to the high turnout for the \u201cuncommitted\u201d campaign vote, and made no mention of it in a more than 300-word statement issued on Tuesday night \u2013 instead focusing on his record on infrastructure, healthcare, labor and the threat of a second Trump term. \u201cIt\u2019s astounding how many words that statement used to describe and distract from the reality that over 100,000 Democratic presidential primary voters in Michigan showed up to vote for peace and against war,\u201d Abbas Alawieh, a spokesperson for the Listen to Michigan campaign, told the Guardian. \u201cMy advice to President Biden and his team would be not to ignore this movement but to engage productively with us.\u201d The formal demands of the Listen to Michigan campaign are for a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to unconditional US military aid to Israel. \u201cPresident Biden needs to emerge as a pro-peace president if he\u2019s going to earn our vote,\u201d said Alawieh."

            "content": "In August 2020, wildfire burned almost the entire Big Basin Redwoods state park in California, scorching ancient redwood trees, some dating back more than 1,500 years and among the tallest living things on Earth. Redwoods are naturally fire resistant thanks to their thick bark, but the wildfire was so intense and flames so high the trees\u2019 foliage was destroyed, even in tree canopies more than 300ft high. It was feared the redwoods would never recover, but a few months later something incredible happened \u2013 many of the trees began sprouting tiny leaf needles from blackened trunks and branches, and two years later the forest had turned green. Much of this fresh growth sprouted from buds under the bark and also deep inside the trees, some buds having lain dormant for more than 1,000 years. When researchers covered the sprouting buds to stop them photosynthesising, they still grew. The buds were tapping into stored sugars and radiocarbon dating revealed these sugars were stored for up to 21 years, with various stored carbohydrates nearly 60 years old. So, the resurrection of the redwoods relied on tapping into old stores of carbon to fuel their dormant buds into life."

            "date": "2024-02-14T12:52:43Z",
            "content": "The housing market is expected to stage a recovery in 2024 after average UK house prices fell by only \u00a34,000 last year, according to official figures. The price of the average home decreased by 1.4% in the 12 months to December 2023, an improvement on an annual fall of 2.3% recorded in November, the Office for National Statistics said. The figures suggest that a slowdown in the housing sector in 2023 triggered by rising mortgage costs may be over, and a downward trend in house prices has bottomed out. After gains of more than 20% since 2020 that added more than \u00a360,000 to the average UK house price, the latest figures show an annual drop of \u00a34,000 to \u00a3285,000 in December. Prices hit a peak of \u00a3291,100 in the autumn of 2022. Pent-up demand from cash buyers and first-time buyers who can access much cheaper mortgages than they could in 2023 is expected to push up prices back towards their peak this year, according to many economists. The Bank of England is forecast to cut interest rates this year from 5.25% to 4.5%, prompting lenders to cut their latest two- and five-year fixed-rate mortgage offers. Figures from the Halifax and Nationwide have shown prices bouncing back since the start of the year as mortgage loan costs tumble. Gabriella Dickens, a UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cWe expect the official measure to follow the Nationwide measure and start to rebound, as the fall in mortgage rates and recovery in real incomes boosts affordability.\u201d England had the highest average prices of all the UK nations and it experienced the biggest fall last year, down 2.1% to \u00a3302,000. Property values in Wales fell by 2.5%. Scotland had the lowest average price and a rise in prices of 3.3% to \u00a3190,000, closing the gap in prices across the UK. The north-west of England had the highest annual percentage change in 2023 \u2013 up 1.2% \u2013 while the lowest was in London, at -4.8%. While house prices dipped in 2023, private rents continued to soar. In the two years before March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic forced the government to lockdown the economy, rental inflation averaged 1.5%. Since then, rental costs have jumped year on year before levelling off at 6% over the last four months of 2023. \u201cPrivate rental prices paid by tenants in the UK rose by 6.2% in the 12 months to January 2024, unchanged for the second consecutive month,\u201d the ONS said. \u201cWithin England, London had the highest annual percentage change in private rental prices in the 12 months to January 2024, at 6.9%, while the north-east saw the lowest, at 4.7%.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-28T17:51:04Z",
            "content": "The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has admitted it would take time for a Labour government to turn Britain around, as she accused the Conservatives of vandalising the economy over the past 14 years. Speaking before next week\u2019s budget, Reeves said the party that wins the next election would have the worst inheritance of any incoming government since the war and that a national mission was needed to kickstart the economy. \u201cI recognise the dire inheritance we would have if we win the election. I am not going to be able to turn everything round overnight. We are going to have to grow the economy. There will be a relentless focus on what we need to grow the economy,\u201d the shadow chancellor said. Referring to a soundbite used by George Osborne before the Conservatives came to power in 2010, Reeves said: \u201cGeorge Osborne promised to fix the nation\u2019s roof. But the Conservatives have broken the windows, kicked the door in and now they\u2019re burning the house down.\u201d Jeremy Hunt is putting the finishing touches to next Wednesday\u2019s budget, with the Treasury massaging down expectations of the size of an anticipated tax giveaway in light of deteriorating forecasts for the public finances from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which will give its final, confidential pre-budget assessment to the Treasury on Friday. \u201cI am not going pre-empt what the chancellor does or the forecasts published by the OBR,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cHowever, we do know that the budget will paint a picture of 14 years of economic failure. The next government \u2013 Conservative or Labour \u2013 will inherit the worst set of economic circumstances since the second world war.\u201d Sketching out Labour\u2019s critique of the government\u2019s economic record since 2010, Reeves said public debt as a share of national output was at the highest level since the 1960s; debt interest payments were at the highest level since the second world war; taxes as a share of national output were the highest since 1949; the economy was smaller than when Rishi Sunak became prime minister in October 2022; and the current parliament was on track to be the first in which living standards \u2013 as measured by real household disposable incomes \u2013 fell. \u201cThere needs to be a national mission to kickstart our economy\u201d, she said. \u201cInstead, we\u2019re having a debate in the Conservative party about headroom and what\u2019s best for Rishi Sunak\u2019s leadership.\u201d Hunt will use next week\u2019s speech to say the worst is over for the economy and that it is already recovering from the mild recession that it slipped into in the second half of 2023. But the chancellor\u2019s room for manoeuvre is limited by official forecasts showing he will meet one of his fiscal rules \u2013 to have national debt falling in five years\u2019 time \u2013 by the narrowest of margins. Reeves has been reluctant to say whether Labour would support any tax cuts Hunt might announce next week, preferring to wait until the OBR publishes its judgment on the the impact of Hunt\u2019s measures after the budget. She rejected accusations that Labour\u2019s plan for the economy differed little from that of the Conservatives. \u201cPeople will see a real change in our economy under Labour. People will see something they haven\u2019t seen for a long time: an economy that\u2019s growing and creating prosperity,\u201d she said. Reeves said Labour\u2019s growth plan was built on three pillars: stability, investment and reform."

            "date": "2024-02-07T09:45:21Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak has been accused of making a U-turn on his pledge to restore NHS dentistry as experts say his \u201crecovery plan\u201d does not offer enough money to incentivise dentists to take on extra NHS patients. The prime minister\u2019s long-awaited proposals have been criticised for failing to ringfence funding for the dental sector and reform the NHS dentistry contract, which means millions across the country will continue to struggle to access care. The health secretary, Victoria Atkins, repeatedly dodged questions on whether the plan was being funded by an underspend in the NHS dentistry budget and if the current budget was far lower than it was 10 years ago. Sunak\u2019s plan, described as the means to \u201cput NHS dentistry on a sustainable footing\u201d, comes after police were called to manage a queue of hundreds of people outside a reopened dental practice in Bristol on Monday. Under the plan, NHS dentists will be given a \u201cnew patient\u201d payment of between \u00a315 and \u00a350, depending on the treatment needed, to help care for 1 million new patients who have not seen a dentist in two years or more. The British Dental Association (BDA) has said the \u00a3200m pledged by the government is less than half of the underspends in the budget expected this year, leaving no new money for the promised new patient premium. Labour\u2019s health spokesperson, Wes Streeting, claimed there was a \u00a3400m underspend in the NHS dentistry budget last year. Atkins told BBC\u2019s Breakfast programme the plan was backed by \u201can additional \u00a3200m\u201d. \u201cThe budget is \u00a33bn,\u201d she added. \u201cWe are spending more on the NHS than we ever have.\u201d Dr Simon Chard, the former president of British Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, told Sky News the current dental contract was \u201cpushing\u201d dentists out of the NHS to work in the private sector. Despite these warnings, Atkins told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme she \u201ccan\u2019t possibly\u201d guarantee that dentists who took on NHS patients would fully get their money back for all the work the patient got done, even as part of the new incentive package. The government accidentally sent details of the scheme to all MPs on Tuesday afternoon, which included the plan to offer NHS dentists cash incentives to take on extra patients and a new scheme to send dental teams to schools and nurseries to tackle tooth decay. Sunak was praised for offering parents and parents-to-be advice on how to take care of babies\u2019 gums and milk teeth as part of the Smile for Life programme. Dental vans will be deployed in rural and coastal areas to reach the most isolated communities. But Shawn Charlwood, the chair of the BDA\u2019s general dental practice committee, said: \u201cThis \u2018recovery plan\u2019 is not worthy of the title. It won\u2019t halt the exodus from the workforce or offer hope to millions struggling to access care. Nothing here meets government\u2019s stated ambitions, or makes this service fit for the future. \u201cMinisters wanted to stop dentistry becoming an election issue. By rearranging the deckchairs they\u2019ve achieved the exact opposite. The crisis will remain a burning issue in communities across this country until we get real change.\u201d Labour accused the government of stealing its dentist recruitment plans and proposals on supervised toothbrushing that were rubbished by a number of Conservative MPs earlier this year. The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, said: \u201cAfter 14 years of Conservative neglect, patients are desperately queueing around the block to see a dentist, literally pulling their own teeth out, and tooth decay is the No 1 reason for six- to 10-year-olds being admitted to hospital. \u201cThe Conservatives are only promising to do something about it now there\u2019s an election coming. By adopting Labour\u2019s proposals for recruitment and supervised toothbrushing, they are finally admitting that they are out of ideas of their own. \u201cIt will be left to the next Labour government to rescue NHS dentistry and get patients seen on time once again.\u201d According to the BDA, 23,577 dentists carried out NHS work in the 2022-23 financial year, the lowest number since 2012-13 and a reduction of 1,100 dentists compared with pre-Covid levels. Four in five dentists in England are not taking on new NHS patients and, according to analysis by the Labour party, 71.1%, are not accepting children. The BDA has said the \u00a33bn dental budget has remained static for a decade and has not accounted for inflation and rising demand. It says the budget has been cut in real terms by more than \u00a31bn since 2010."

            "title": "Record long-term sickness bodes ill for UK economic growth",
            "date": "2024-02-17T17:00:20Z",
            "content": "Britain has a sick economy and it is getting sicker. The clear message from last week\u2019s raft of economic data is that the UK is being held back by the growing number of people not able to work because of long-term illness. There are many theories about why the trend is worsening. Possible factors include long Covid, delays in NHS treatment as waiting lists grow longer, poor workplace practices, stress and the impact of austerity. But one thing is certain. The economic impact of ill health is a headache for Jeremy Hunt. It will be a headache for Rachel Reeves if she becomes the first female chancellor. It is a headache for every business that is struggling to fill vacancies. Figures released last week by the Office for National Statistics illustrated the extent of the problem. The number of people saying they are inactive due to long-term sickness is now 2.8 million \u2013 an increase of more than 200,000 in the past year and of 700,000 since the pandemic started in 2020. This matters, and not just for those who would be working if their circumstances were different. This high level of long-term illness helps explain why the UK\u2019s workforce is 700,000 smaller than its pre-Covid level, why the labour market is so tight and why the economy is flatlining. Jane Gratton, deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cBusinesses are growing increasingly concerned about higher levels of inactivity and its economic impact. It is impacting on growth and inflation. Wages are rising because of skills shortages. This has an effect on both employers and individuals.\u201d This is not a new issue. Large numbers of employees were invalided out of the workforce when factories and coalmines were closed in the de-industrialisation of the 1980s and 1990s. This century, Britain has had a higher percentage of people inactive due to ill health than Germany, France or Italy. But two new factors \u2013 Covid and longer NHS waiting lists \u2013 have made matters significantly worse in recent years. Yet what\u2019s especially worrying for economic policymakers is that Britain has gone from being the G7 country with the lowest levels of inactivity to the one where, uniquely, the workforce has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. The Office for Budget Responsibility has pointed out: \u201cThe available international evidence suggests that while the UK has consistently been a strong performer internationally in terms of working-age participation, its post-pandemic rise in inactivity stands out. And ill health has consistently been a bigger factor behind inactivity in the UK than in most other advanced economies, with post-pandemic trends likely to have amplified these differences.\u201d While it would be tempting to dub Britain the sick man of Europe, it would not be strictly accurate. Feminist thinktank the Women\u2019s Budget Group (WBG) has pointed out that there are 200,000 more women than men inactive due to ill health (1.5 million against 1.3 million). The WBG says this is not just down to Covid, but continues a trend that was evident before the pandemic. Zubaida Haque, the WBG\u2019s deputy director, said women were more likely to be in low-paid jobs and suffering the impact of austerity. \u201cThis has not been happening in a vacuum. Women were hit disproportionately by the pandemic but they were also more severely impacted by the benefit cuts made between 2010 and 2020. It is no good the government trying to deal with the symptoms of the problem.\u201d Hannah Slaughter, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the 2.8 million people inactive due to long-term sickness were a real concern: \u201cThis is holding back the economy, putting pressure on the public finances and the NHS, and limiting opportunities for too many people. Reversing this trend will be a priority for the current and next government.\u201d According to the Department for Work and Pensions, the government is already on the case. A spokesperson said: \u201cWith an extra 4 million people in work since 2010, we are now going even further, with welfare reforms forecast to reduce the number of people who would otherwise have been placed in the highest tier of incapacity benefits by over 370,000. \u201cOur back to work plan will help over a million people, including those with disabilities and long-term health conditions, to start and stay in work, as we continue to bring down inflation, cut taxes and grow the economy.\u201d One option for the government would be to try to fill the hundreds of thousands of job vacancies by tightening welfare conditions. But experts such as Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation thinktank, have warned that forcing people into work through punitive benefit sanctions would be counterproductive and might lead to more ill health. Whichever approach it decides to take, the government is under pressure to do more, both in terms of preventing illness, and in tailoring back-to-work programmes for those who take time off sick, ensuring that they don\u2019t exit the labour market altogether. While it is inactivity due to ill health that has grabbed the headlines recently, plenty of people with health problems are working, and are more likely to carry on if they get appropriate support. A study by the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank found people were more likely to leave work because of a heart condition than for any other health problem. The IPPR said someone suffering the onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 2021-22 had a 22% likelihood of leaving their job, compared with 14% for those with a mental health problem and 16% for those diagnosed with cancer. Chris Thomas, head of the IPPR\u2019s commission on health and prosperity, said: \u201cAfter great strides in tackling cardiovascular disease in the 20th century, the UK is now stalling, if not reversing. This is costing not just lives, but also livelihoods. The good news is that heart disease is one of the most preventable health conditions, but the government has to get on to the front foot and deliver proactive policies. Both human lives and economic prosperity depend on it.\u201d Gratton at the BCC said firms could help by allowing flexible working, investing more in occupational health and offering staff medical insurance. Jon Boys, senior research economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said the reduction in workers was compounding labour supply difficulties and limiting growth. There was ample evidence of both in last week\u2019s economic data, with the ONS reporting more than 900,000 job vacancies and unemployment below 4%, at a time when the UK economy was in recession. Boys said breaking down barriers to working for people with health problems should be a priority for policymakers and employers. Like Gratton, he said it was vital to focus on occupational health, to prevent individuals from exiting the workforce prematurely: \u201cIt is all very well getting people back into work but the bigger issue is not allowing them to fall out of it in the first place.\u201d Boys said both government and employers needed to address inactivity: employers through an awareness of the impact of stress in the workplace and addressing heavy and unsustainable workloads, and ministers by tackling NHS waiting lists. \u201cThe government has to recognise that health policy is economic policy,\u201d Boys said. \u201cThey can\u2019t be treated in silos.\u201d"

            "content": "Get pumped for the Steroid Olympics Have you ever dreamed up a completely deranged business idea but lacked the cash to execute it? Peter Thiel, the secretive tech billionaire who co-founded Paypal, doesn\u2019t have that problem. He, along with a group of other venture capitalists, is currently deploying part of his vast fortune to help bankroll a pro-drugs version of the Olympics called the Enhanced Games. It\u2019s exactly what it sounds like: a sporting competition in which participants are encouraged to take as many performance-enhancing substances as they can get their steroid-enlarged hands on. All in the name of science and innovation, naturally. Honestly? It sounds amazing. I would 100% watch. It\u2019s a real shame Thiel, who currently runs spy tech firm Palantir, doesn\u2019t spend all his resources on reality TV ideas masquerading as science instead of his many other dystopian projects. Thiel, you see, isn\u2019t just a guy who really likes the idea of bionic boxing: he\u2019s a libertarian and ideologue who has an exerted an oversized and pernicious influence on American politics and culture. Max Chafkin, who has written a biography of Thiel, has said he thinks the billionaire is \u201csecretly the most important person in Silicon Valley. He\u2019s this behind the scenes player, who is behind so many of the really important things that have happened over the last two decades.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t disagree. For all his obsession with innovation, Thiel has some stone-age views on the world. He doesn\u2019t seem completely sold on the whole women-having-rights thing, for example. In 2009, for example, he published an essay lamenting that women being given the right to vote had dealt a blow to libertarianism. His exact words: \u201cSince 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women \u2013 two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians \u2013 have rendered the notion of \u2018capitalist democracy\u2019 into an oxymoron.\u201d Thiel also isn\u2019t a fan of diversity initiatives, which he has called \u201cvery evil and very silly\u201d. This guy, let me remind you, is a key player in technology and one of the first outside investors in Facebook. With people like him at the helm, is it any wonder social media has such a massive misogyny and racism problem? Thiel, like every obscenely rich person in America, has used a large chunk of his money to try and influence politics. He threw his weight behind Donald Trump in 2016 and backed numerous anti-abortion candidates. Interestingly, however, it looks like the billionaire is taking a step back from political funding in this election cycle. One reason for this seems to be the fact that he realizes (shock horror!) that Trump was dangerous and incompetent. Thiel, who is gay, has also said his his husband doesn\u2019t want him to give the political candidates he formerly backed any more money. I wonder why that is? Maybe, just maybe, it\u2019s because these candidates spend half their time yelling homophobic conspiracy theories about LGBT people being groomers. Of course, the fact that Thiel is stepping back from direct political donations doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not going to meddle in politics any more. It doesn\u2019t mean he is any less awful or dangerous than he\u2019s always been. Still, we can grasp at straws can\u2019t we? I, for one, am trying to find any reason to be optimistic about the future of our current hell world. And so I\u2019m choosing to see Thiel\u2019s retreat from the front line of politics and his embrace of drug-powered sports as a positive. Please, Mr Thiel, I implore you: spend a lot more of your time on steroid-fueled Olympics and less time on stripping away our civil rights. Oklahoma bill would criminalize sexting before marriage The wide-ranging bill \u2013 proposed by Baptist pastor turned state senator Dusty Deevers \u2013 makes viewing \u201cobscene materials\u201d a felony, and defines \u201cobscene\u201d extremely broadly. However, it does have some very specific exceptions. As Reason\u2019s Elizabeth Nolan Brown explained: \u201c[The bill] also contains this weird clause where it says, this is not meant to go after married couples who are communicating with each other. So it has this weird carve-out if you\u2019re sexting while married.\u201d It\u2019s not clear if this bill will pass. What is very clear is that Republicans are completely obsessed with porn. Gen Z women are more liberal than their male counterparts That\u2019s according to a Financial Times analysis of Gallup data that\u2019s gone viral. \u201cIn the US, Gallup data shows that after decades where the sexes were each spread roughly equally across liberal and conservative world views, women aged 18 to 30 are now 30 percentage points more liberal than their male contemporaries,\u201d the FT notes. It\u2019s a similar story around the world\u2013and in South Korea and China the difference is even more dramatic. The #MeToo movement helped spur this gender divide. And it seems very likely that influential \u201cmanosphere\u201d influencers like Andrew Tate are also a component. New study sheds light on why autoimmune diseases are more common in women Women account for as many as 80% of all cases of autoimmune diseases. Nobody knows why this is but a new study suggests that it\u2019s due to a molecule called Xist (which sounds like a name Elon Musk would give his kid) that is made only in female cells. Trump ordered to pay E Jean Carroll $83.3m Carroll has said she plans to spend the money on something the former president \u201chates\u201d. However she probably won\u2019t get the money for a while, if at all: Trump has said he will appeal the decision and this may take a while. So while it\u2019s a victory for Carroll, the real winners, as usual, are the lawyers. Could ovaries unlock the secret to living forever? Tech executive Nicole Shanahan thinks they might \u2013 and she is spending $100mn to find out. The Financial Times has a fascinating long read on Shanahan\u2019s pioneering investment in women\u2019s reproductive longevity. \u201cIf she is successful, this new knowledge may have the kind of profound consequences that came with the arrival of the contraceptive pill,\u201d the FT notes. \u201cAnd the ovaries, it turns out, could offer clues to extending the lifespan of all humans.\u201d Women are suing Tennessee for denying them abortions \u201cAlthough every state with an abortion ban has some kind of exception that should theoretically allow for abortions in medical emergencies, doctors and patients across the country have said that the bans are worded in such a way as to be unworkable in reality,\u201d the Guardian reports.

            "date": "2024-02-16T18:58:54Z",
            "content": "Formula One\u2019s season-opening salvo finally came to a close on Thursday when the last of this year\u2019s challengers was unveiled by Red Bull. Pleasingly, given what for the most part has been a series of low-key whimpers with cars largely revealed online only with little fanfare and little detail, it ended with something of a bang. Red Bull have likely left their competitors feeling nervous before a wheel has turned in anger. The launch of the RB20 had unsurprisingly been dominated by the appearance of Christian Horner, the team principal, who was speaking publicly for the first time since an investigation was launched almost two weeks ago after a complaint from an employee about his conduct. He repeatedly issued denials there was any truth in the allegations, while also dutifully trying to draw attention to the new car on show at the event. It was largely a forlorn task. Until the investigation concludes, Horner will retain at least equal billing with his car. Their competitors, however, would have been observing the new ride with no little diligence and when the RB20 emerged into the light, it would have caused a sharp intake of breath. For two years Red Bull have utterly dominated F1. Their interpretation of the new regulations in 2022, led by their technical director, Adrian Newey, and specifically the role of ground effect aerodynamics, was an extraordinary feat that delivered a design which proved untouchable. A year later, expectations that rivals would unlock their pace and move up to Red Bull were confounded, leaving the world champions surprised as they moved even further ahead. They won 21 of 22 races with the RB19, an unprecedented run of success. The team acknowledged by mid-season that there were likely diminishing returns from development as they believed they were already near to the edge of the envelope of the regulations. A refinement of an already superlative package was expected for 2024 and, as their rivals moved close to the Red Bull design, an element of convergence in pace was anticipated. Instead, what Red Bull wheeled out on Thursday was an aggressive development, innovation and experimentation over conservative evolution. Rather than tweaking to edge toward marginal gains they have gone bold, looking to push the boundaries. The car\u2019s one weakness last season, and it was far from being a real achilles heel, was through the slow speed corners so it was vulnerable on street circuits such as Monaco and Singapore. Indeed, that single defeat was at Marina Bay to Ferrari\u2019s Carlos Sainz. It must have rankled and clearly the team have set out to remedy it. With such strengths elsewhere the innovation must surely be aimed at ironing out the only kink. The season has not yet started but perhaps the target when Newey and his team began was building a car capable of returning an elusive unbeaten championship. The design was most striking not least in being an aggressive departure, but also noticeably in featuring elements with shades of the Mercedes design the team persisted with for two unsuccessful seasons and then dropped for 2024. In particular, the vertical sidepod inlets, a feature of Mercedes\u2019 controversial zero-sidepod design they have now abandoned, and a bulge under the engine cover, a feature of the cooling on last year\u2019s Mercedes. Even Red Bull\u2019s all conquering world champion, Max Verstappen, acknowledged it when asked about the similarities. \u201cI would still call it a Red Bull style but I know what you mean,\u201d he said. Horner explained the changes had been driven by research into performance, that simulation had backed their theories and he in turn backed the team\u2019s bold direction. \u201cIt\u2019s not a conservative evolution,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some great innovation.\u201d Newey, too, exuded a quiet confidence at the launch of the car, a sense that this was far from a shot in the dark. Mercedes, to be fair, have not simply followed last year\u2019s Red Bull template as other teams have but also demonstrated innovation of their own, in their sidepod configuration, in moving their cockpit back, as had been requested by Lewis Hamilton, and on rear and front wings. Yet it is impossible not to consider the team will be spitting feathers if Red Bull manage to pull off the sidepod design they believed promised so much but were forced to abandon. How all this shakes out, whether Red Bull have once more left their rivals for dead or even driven down a dead end, remains conjecture for the moment but not for much longer. For three short days beginning on Wednesday, testing will begin in Bahrain, before the first race at the Sakhir circuit on 2 March. There is precious little time so there will certainly be cards on the table. Verstappen, ominously, believes Red Bull once more have a winning hand. \u201cWhat I like about the team is that we had a great package,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they took the chance to really go all out and try to make it better.\u201d"

It proved a resonant decision for the twentysomething vibraphonist, transforming his view of the blues from archaic 12-bar form to what he calls \u201ca sort of spirit, an energy\u201d. The pandemic also made Ross wonder whether his three previous albums for Blue Note were not too fussy, too concerned with \u201ctime and tempo manipulations\u201d, a little daunting for the uncommitted. This fourth offering, while made with his regular Good Vibes group, a high-grade four-piece featuring alto sax player Immanuel Wilkins, is more accessible. The set is anchored by breezy covers of Thelonious Monk\u2019s Evidence and John Coltrane\u2019s Equinox and Central Park West, with seven original pieces. The title track and Mellowdee are shimmering showcases for Ross\u2019s talent. The former, full of echoing runs, almost sounds like vibes-in-dub; the latter has him sparring with Wilkins\u2019s wiry alto. What Am I Waiting For? has echoes of Charles Mingus\u2019s mournful Goodbye Pork Pie Hat; Bach (God the Father in Eternity) is church-like; while on Chant, Ross switches to piano for a brief, intense duet with flautist (and partner) Gabrielle Garo. An innovative homage to tradition."

            "content": "What does the rest of the audience make of the show you\u2019re watching? Beyond the odd gasp or laugh it can be hard to tell but this audacious, tech-savvy production by devised theatre company The Paper Birds repeatedly measures its impact. We use our phones throughout and, when prompted, select from a number of responses about how the scenes make us feel. It\u2019s a test of empathy and, initially, preconceptions. This is a tale of forced displacement, we are told. Where might the story be set, why has the character left home and how old are they? The screens on stage, within a temporary shelter designed by Imogen Melhuish, reveal our range of assumptions. A later series of skits will suggest how they have been influenced by the media. Three performer-devisers, Lil McGibbon, Daz Scott and Kiren Virdee, share the role of a nameless displaced person yet withhold most of their personality. They strap on rucksacks, keep moving, enter a bureaucratic processing system and reach temporary accommodation. The sequence of events is familiar but the question the show raises is how different approaches to framing the journey may raise our level of empathy. The task of cutting through statistics, and how to recognise the plurality of displaced people\u2019s experiences rather than highlight one individual\u2019s, is continually raised. But does representing this largely through wordless physical theatre begin to help us understand or distance us from the character? Feel Me has a questing and provocative approach but the result is often more contemplative than emotional. The use of comedy is uneven \u2013 a satire of headlines about refugees is a stinging rebuke of othering but the curiously jaunty scene, with muzak, in a queue for accommodation strikes the wrong note. The closing acknowledgment, in which the trio voice unease at exploring the subject without lived experience, would be better placed earlier in the story and more fully explored. Writer-director Jemma McDonnell and co-director Kylie Perry\u2019s dynamic multimedia production, which includes live-filmed sequences, succeeds most in presenting these questions for a young, digitally fluent audience (it is recommended for over-13s). The interactive elements work seamlessly throughout and it boldly ends by asking the audience to rate its overall impact, revealed on screen. The results suggested my fellow theatregoers had more of an emotional response to an inventive, well-performed show that ultimately made me think rather than feel. It is a fascinating experiment but the journey taken by an Afghan refugee family in The Boy With Two Hearts, at Wales Millennium Centre in 2021, proved the power of traditional character-driven drama as an empathy machine. At Stephen Joseph theatre, Scarborough, on 28 February. Then touring until 1 May."

            "date": "2024-02-10T14:35:18Z",
            "content": "Entrepreneurs are a false god. We offer them billions of pounds\u2019 worth of tax breaks and subsidies, and a lot of goodwill, when research suggests that most, after pocketing the cash, will do little to help UK plc prosper. Academic studies have found that small business owners, while being a significant slice of the economy and a source of employment, are very rarely the spur for innovation or increases in productivity, let alone the wellbeing of the workers under their employ (health and safety is worse in small businesses). If you want innovation and creativity, big companies with expertise to spare are a better bet \u2013 or the kind of startups that thrive, like arm\u2019s-length subsidiaries, shielded by the umbrella of a university or private equity firm. These are companies worthy of targeted state support. On the other hand, the idea of the entrepreneur as wealth generator par excellence is at best unproven and at worst entirely misplaced. It is important to pay attention to the academic literature, because entrepreneurship underpins the neoliberal narrative that has dominated politics for the past 40 years and still forms the bedrock of mainstream economic thought. Without any supporting empirical evidence, this belief has meant almost every entrepreneur getting a handout in the desperate hope that they might build a Microsoft or Amazon. At the start of 2023 there were 1.4m small businesses (those with 1 to 49 employees) and 36,900 medium-sized businesses in the UK (those with 50 to 249 employees). Last month, the National Audit Office (NAO) identified 39 reliefs aimed at increasing business investment. The bill for 29 \u2013 most of them aimed at small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) \u2013 was estimated at \u00a316.6bn. What bang did the government get for its buck? The NAO said: \u201cThe Treasury and HMRC do not monitor or evaluate reliefs closely enough to understand if they cost too much or achieve their intended economic impacts.\u201d Entrepreneurs\u2019 relief costs about \u00a33bn a year, and aims to encourage people to start or join growing companies, by lowering the rate of capital gains tax they pay when selling the company. A review in 2019 by Adam Corlett at the Resolution Foundation came to a similar conclusion as the NAO: it is possible to see that 52,000 people claimed the relief in 2015-16, with an average gain of \u00a375,000 per person, but not whether their businesses were hi-tech startups or restaurant chains. Other tax reliefs for business are available, enterprise zones among them, where there is almost no understanding of the benefit of such colossally expensive state gifts. Paul Nightingale, a professor of strategy at Sussex University, says the UK is not alone. Most governments have failed to provide a rigorous analysis of the impact that SMEs have on economic productivity and growth. Nightingale wrote a paper with Alex Coad, a professor at the Waseda Business School in Tokyo, that divided SMEs into \u201cgazelles\u201d and \u201cmuppets\u201d (marginal undersized poor performance enterprises). \u201cMuppets\u201d might seem harsh, but the former Bank of England economist, Andy Haldane, a member of the Treasury\u2019s economic advisory council, was even less flattering when he called them \u201czombies\u201d. \u201cDespite an almost universally accepted belief outside academia that entrepreneurial activity is a positive driving force in the economy, the accumulated evidence remains largely inconclusive,\u201d the academics say. \u201cA small proportion of high-performing firms drive the majority of innovation, wealth creation and new job generation, while most firms, including the median small business and the median startup, have only a marginal impact.\u201d The economist most closely tied with the narrative that small firms can be creative, innovative and disruptive is Joseph Schumpeter, while the free-market evangelist Friedrich Hayek was credited by Ronald Reagan\u2019s advisers and Margaret Thatcher as a touchstone. Coad says their positions are almost religious, in that they are faith-based rather than relying on evidence. Mariana Mazzucato, an economics professor at University College London, attacks the issue from a different angle. Her book on industrial policy, Public Purpose, shows most \u201cgazelles\u201d are fostered by the state \u2013 and not through indiscriminate subsidies, but consistent and persistent support from state agencies. Rather than weighing down a dynamic private sector, public investments have been behind many of the greatest innovations of our time, she argues. Yet politicians are hard-wired to believe profound creativity only happens in the garden shed of a genius entrepreneur. Now we must put up with Alan Sugar, star of the The Apprentice \u2013 the 18th series of which is now showing on BBC One \u2013 showcasing people we are told will enhance the UK\u2019s economic potential. As a young entrepreneur, Lord Sugar created the Amstrad line of computers, built from pre-assembled components into machines that ultimately became a footnote in the history of IT. However, he made most of his fortune \u2013 like so many British businesspeople \u2013 from property. No doubt most of his proteges will go down the same route. In the budget next month, Jeremy Hunt will laud entrepreneurs, and Labour will do the same. Before they do, a bit of evidence for their cheerleading would be nice."

            "date": "2024-02-20T14:00:51Z",
            "content": "The Australian Taxation Office justified a decision to capture older Australians and those on lower incomes in a controversial scheme that resurrects decades-old debts by arguing that people could always apply to have their debt waived by the finance minister. However, the debt waiver process \u2013 which is carried out by finance officials \u2013 is described by the department as \u201cgenerally an avenue of last resort\u201d, with debts \u201crarely waived solely on the basis of financial hardship\u201d. Guardian Australia revealed on Tuesday that internal ATO documents released under freedom of information laws show the agency has been preparing to expand an initiative to clawback historic debts this year. It aims to clawback more than $15bn from 1.8m entities, largely consisting of individuals. Dubbed robotax, the initiative has drawn comparison to the flawed robodebt compliance program that shifted the onus of proof on people to disprove they owe debts they were often unaware had accrued. The tax office has said it is now reviewing the program and assessing its next steps. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The old tax debts are deemed on-hold, marked to be scraped from tax refunds. Recipients so far caught up in the scheme have complained they do not know how the debts were incurred and no longer have documents required to challenge them. In correspondence with government officials late last year, the ATO acknowledged concerns had been raised regarding the age of the debts and ability for taxpayers to verify or challenge the amounts. It considered seeking a reprieve for some affected taxpayers, before deciding against it. Part of its reasoning included an \u201cability for clients to directly seek a waiver from the minister of finance\u201d. According to the finance department\u2019s website, the \u201cwaiver of debt mechanism is generally an avenue of last resort\u201d and is described as \u201cdiscretionary\u201d. The website notes that \u201cyour personal circumstances\u201d, including financial details, may be relevant but it notes \u201cthe waiver of debt provision is not used to address financial hardship\u201d. Those caught by the campaign told Guardian Australia the initiative was unfair, lacked transparency, was almost impossible to challenge and failed to provide guidance on how to seek a waiver. One Sydney worker said on Tuesday he was notified of a 12-year-old debt for several hundred dollars with no accompanying information. \u201cTo say to someone 12 years later, \u2018Hey, you\u2019ve got a debt and, by the way, we can\u2019t tell you what it is for\u2019, is plainly unfair,\u201d said the worker, who asked for his name to be withheld. \u201cThis type of debt will be almost impossible to defend against as most people will have destroyed their paper records.\u201d Many of the debts far exceed the five-year retention period most taxpayers are required to keep records. One taxpayer who works in bank compliance said: \u201cIf we chased customers for debts in this manner we would be rightly hauled in front of a royal commission and publicly shamed.\u201d The person said that chasing these debts would put a bank in breach of numerous \u201cunconscionable conduct\u201d consumer protection laws, including a requirement to act \u201cefficiently, honestly and fairly\u201d. The ATO campaign suspended its communication campaign alerting people of the historical debts in November after acknowledging it had caused \u201cunnecessary distress\u201d. But the debts remain and the program has been marked for expansion. The ATO has been removing exemptions that had previously filtered out debts if they were very old, small, or the taxpayer was aged over 70 years or earning a taxable income of less than $50,000. An ATO spokesperson said the agency was legally obliged to remove the exclusions. \u201cDecisions on the process of removing the exclusion criteria have entirely been a decision of the ATO,\u201d the spokesperson said on Tuesday. The internal documents show that ATO officials warned the government it should be prepared for public criticism. Tax officials said in a briefing note sent to the office of the assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, late last year that taxpayers may approach ministers directly with their concerns. \u201cWhile every effort is being made to mitigate the client experience, we do expect criticism and complaints from clients who are impacted,\u201d an ATO official told Jones\u2019 office in December. A spokesperson for Jones said the government welcomed the decision by the ATO to review its approach. The debts are often linked to old business activity statements, GST payments, PAYG instalments and non-lodgment fines applied to those living overseas, with many of the debts unknowingly accrued and invisible to taxpayers for years. The ATO also shared \u201cmedia briefing lines\u201d with government officials last year as the initiative ramped up. One of those lines reads: \u201cAs some time may have passed since these debts were put \u2018on hold\u2019, some taxpayers may not remember they have a debt and it may come as a surprise if a refund they were expecting is retained by the ATO to offset a debt on hold.\u201d Do you know more?

            "date": "2024-02-25T11:08:10Z",
            "content": "When Canada\u2019s justice minister announced plans to legalise medically assisted dying nearly a decade ago, she acknowledged the proposed law might prove divisive. \u201cFor some, medical assistance in dying will be troubling,\u201d Jody Wilson-Raybould told reporters in 2016. \u201cFor others, this legislation will not go far enough.\u201d A fresh delay in expanding the scope of who can access a medically assisted death has once again put a spotlight on the system, which critics and advocates agree is one of the most liberal in the world. But the two groups remain sharply divided on what that means for improving the quality of life \u2013 and death \u2013 in the country. Medical assistance in dying (Maid) laws, crafted in response to a supreme court decision, initially permitted only terminally ill Canadians to be eligible for the procedure. But in 2019, a Quebec judge ruled that restricting access to those who had a \u201creasonably foreseeable death\u201d was unconstitutional, forcing federal lawmakers to amend and expand the existing laws. In the years since, Canada\u2019s experiment in physician-assisted death has made international headlines \u2013 including a feature article in the Atlantic magazine last year that investigated how the country\u2019s assisted dying laws \u201cwent wrong\u201d. In 2021, three UN human rights experts cautioned that an expansion to the law, which permitted people with chronic conditions to apply for assisted death, would create a \u201ctwo-tiered system\u201d and push people with disabilities towards suicide. Government figures show that 13,102 people ended their lives under Maid in 2022 \u2013 an increase of 30% on the previous year. \u201cMaid is different depending on what it\u2019s provided for and how it\u2019s provided. It\u2019s not only one thing,\u201d said Sonu Gaind, chief of psychiatry at Toronto\u2019s Sunnybrook hospital. \u201cAnd in that context, these expansions of assisted death in Canada are way beyond what most Canadians would actually support.\u201d In a survey of those 13,102 Canadians who ended their lives under Maid, the vast majority cited the \u201closs of ability to engage in meaningful life activities\u201d as the reason for wanting to die. But other responses have troubled healthcare experts. More than one-third of respondents said their decision was, in part, informed by a feeling they were a perceived burden on family, friends or caregivers. The surge means Canada has one of the highest rates of euthanasia in the world, with 4.1% of deaths aided by doctors. \u201cNo other country has had these numbers in terms of the rate of growth after introducing assisted dying laws,\u201d said Gaind. \u201cThe precipitous growth that we\u2019ve had is unparalleled anywhere.\u201d For others, however, that increase reflects a system working as intended \u2013 and serving a group of Canadians looking to ease immense suffering. \u201cWhat this increase tells me is that Canada has paid the most attention to individual human rights and autonomy,\u201d said Chantal Perrot, a physician and Maid provider. \u201cAn increase in deaths with Maid means to me that people are choosing to die with their loved ones around them. The last days, weeks or months of life can be horrific. Why would they want to go through that if they could have a peaceful death surrounded by their family and loved ones?\u201d Of the 13,102 people who died using assisted death, 96.5% had terminal illnesses or faced imminent death. Only 463 people suffering from a chronic condition accessed Maid. \u201cI work in the healthcare system and see people with severe chronic medical conditions all the time,\u201d said Mona Gupta, a psychiatrist at the University of Montreal and the chair of the federal panel on Maid and Mental Illness. \u201cThe idea that 400 of them \u2013 in a country of 40 million people \u2013 had reached the point where they had exhausted all treatment options, and wanted to access Maid, does not seems extreme to me.\u201d In the UK there have been renewed calls for parliament to vote on a law change after a report in the Observer in December about an impassioned plea from the actor Diana Rigg to legalise assisted dying, made in a message recorded shortly before her death from cancer three years ago. Just before Christmas, the Childline founder and broadcaster Esther Rantzen revealed how she has considered assisted dying if her lung cancer treatment does not improve her condition. Critics of a potential British assisted dying law have warned about the difficulties in defining who is eligible, the danger of people being pressured into a decision, and subsequent attempts to widen the law. Quebec \u2013 the province with the highest rate of Maid \u2013 is studying why people are accessing assisted dying in greater numbers each year. Officials in the province have also requested an amendment to the criminal code that would permit people to consent to medically assisted death before the onset of conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s. Still, a string of prominent cases that critics say reflect a broken system have put physicians on the defensive. In one instance, a Canadian Forces veteran claimed she had been offered Maid in response to a request for a wheelchair lift or ramp at her house. While a subsequent investigation found no record that assisted death was offered, Veterans Affairs discovered four cases in which Maid had been inappropriately suggested. The case manager was suspended and the incident was referred to the Royal Canadian Mounted police. In another case, the family of Alan Nichols said he died by euthanasia, with hearing loss listed as the sole criterion. The family reported it to police and health authorities- but neither saw cause to investigate further. The RCMP told the family that Nichols \u201cmet the criteria\u201d for assisted death. But physicians who provide Maid caution that anecdotes of Canadians slipping through the cracks often ignore other critical details of their respective cases, which must include a \u201cgrievous and irremediable medical condition\u201d and do not necessarily suggest a failure in the system. \u201cI have never heard of a case of the Maid criteria being applied wrongly or abusively, or someone who has received Maid who should not have. I\u2019ve heard of none reported by any of the coroner\u2019s offices or any of their provincial oversight groups,\u201d said Perrot. \u201cI ask a lot of questions, but I tend to trust my patients. And so in their answers, until I\u2019m proven otherwise, I assume they\u2019re telling me the truth.\u201d However, she said that doctors cannot stop patients from lying. \u201cWe should be very concerned, if we have reasons to believe that there are cases of Maid that are happening where people don\u2019t fulfil the criteria,\u201d said Gupta. \u201cThat would obviously be completely unacceptable. But we\u2019re not seeing that reflected anywhere.\u201d The next battleground in the expansion of Maid is the inclusion of people with chronic mental illness. When it was forced to rework its laws, the federal government faced pressure from senators to include mental illness as a reason for accessing assisted death. \u201cA competent person with a mental disorder who is suffering terribly and persistently should be able to decide how they will choose to proceed with their life,\u201d the senator Stan Kuthcher told lawmakers last year. \u201cTo deny them this right while permitting it for people whose illness is not a mental disorder is not just stigmatising, it is exclusionary.\u201d In December 2022, the federal government said it would temporarily pause the expansion after facing sharp criticism from healthcare providers, who feared the system was not equipped to handle cases of mental illness. Earlier this month, however, the federal government announced its second pause on expanding the scope of Maid for those with mental illness, pushing it back to 2027. \u201cWe have to make triple sure that we\u2019ve got the rigorous assessment and training that are in place so that people can make that evaluation \u2013 it\u2019s critical to get that evaluation right,\u201d the justice minister, Arif Virani, recently told reporters, adding that his government believed that physician-assisted death for someone with mental illness is different to other situations. \u201cI don\u2019t think the constitution mandates me or our government to provide a service, in this case a healthcare service, when it is not safe to do so and that is our determination that it is not safe at this time.\u201d Gaind, who previously chaired the Maid committee at Toronto\u2019s Humber River hospital, has emerged as one of the country\u2019s most vocal critics for allowing mental illness as a criterion. He previously testified to a parliamentary committee that he and other psychiatrists worry that they are unable to predict the irremediability of mental illness in patients. He cautioned that the country\u2019s assisted death system has become \u201coverly permissive\u201d and has strayed from its original aims of giving Canadians with a terminal illness the chance to prematurely end suffering. \u201cWhen you look at it at a system level, it\u2019s like that old saying: every system is perfectly designed to deliver precisely the results that it delivers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom line is that we\u2019re providing death to people who are not dying.\u201d The dispute has highlighted a fractious clash between ethics and law \u2013 where courts have found rules preventing certain groups from accessing assisted death to be unconstitutional. \u201cDisagreement with the law that we have does not mean that the law \u2026 is not being respected or that there are abuses,\u201d said Gupta. \u201c[Whether we have Maid] is up to society to decide \u2013 and society has decided through its courts and lawmakers that people who are not at the end of life can have access to Maid.\u201d The friction over medically assisted death comes against the backdrop of a healthcare system pushed to the brink and straining to offer adequate care to many Canadians. Tammy Moore, head of the ALS Society of Canada, said one in four people suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis choose to end their lives with Maid. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want people to have access to [assisted death]. But we want people to have choices. And unfortunately, due to the limited services that are available to people with ALS, often they feel that they don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d she said. Like other advocacy groups, ALS Canada has pleaded for funding. In Ontario, the most populous province, they say C$6m (\u00a33.5m) \u2013 a figure that\u2019s \u201cnot even a rounding error\u201d \u2013 could make an immense change in the quality of life for those with ALS. But if the funding does not come, Moore fears that without financial support, more people with ALS will seek assisted death. For Gaind, the country\u2019s push to liberalise suicide has deterred much-needed investment in the ailing healthcare system and reshaped how society thinks about alleviating suffering. \u201cThis focus on providing easy deaths \u2013 curing \u2018suffering\u2019 by ending life \u2013 I hope it keeps people sensitised to the reality of how people are suffering in different ways. \u201cRather than saying the only thing we can do about that suffering is to end life, we should be asking how we can help with the suffering. How can we actually help people live better, help you get access to the care that they need? How can we help people live with dignity?\u201d For Perrot, the clashing of experts comes at the cost of patients, some of whom have been waiting for decades for the chance to end their lives on their own terms. \u201cPatients voices are the least that are considered. These are not people who want to talk to the media, to talk to politicians or write letters to politicians. There are people who speak to us as clinicians and we have to try to be their voice. But we\u2019re unfortunately falling on deaf ears.\u201d"

            "content": "Tyler Perry has paused an $800m (\u00a3630m) expansion of his Atlanta studio complex after the release of OpenAI\u2019s video generator Sora and warned that \u201ca lot of jobs\u201d in the film industry will be lost to artificial intelligence. The US film and TV mogul said he was in the process of adding 12 sound stages to his studio but has halted those plans indefinitely after he saw demonstrations of Sora and its \u201cshocking\u201d capabilities. \u201cAll of that is currently and indefinitely on hold because of Sora and what I\u2019m seeing,\u201d Perry said in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cI had gotten word over the last year or so that this was coming, but I had no idea until I saw recently the demonstrations of what it\u2019s able to do. It\u2019s shocking to me.\u201d The AI tool was launched on 15 February \u2013 with limited access to a few researchers and video creators \u2013 and caused widespread astonishment with its ability to produce realistic footage a minute long from simple text prompts. Perry, whose successes include the Madea film series, said Sora\u2019s achievements meant he would no longer have to travel to locations or build a set: \u201cI can sit in an office and do this with a computer, which is shocking to me.\u201d Demonstrations released by OpenAI, the developer of the groundbreaking ChatGPT chatbot, show photorealistic scenes in response to prompts such as asking for a shot of people walking through \u201cbeautiful, snowy Tokyo city\u201d where \u201cgorgeous sakura petals are flying through the wind along with snowflakes\u201d. Perry said the breakthroughs presented by Sora would affect a range of jobs throughout the film industry, including those of actors, editors, sound specialists and transportation crew. He said: \u201cI am very, very concerned that in the near future, a lot of jobs are going to be lost. I really, really feel that very strongly.\u201d Perry said an immediate example was the construction workers and contractors who would no longer work on his planned studio expansion because \u201cthere is no need to it\u201d. He added that he used AI in two recently shot films in which the technology was used to age his face and help him avoid hours in the makeup chair. Concerns over the impact of AI on jobs were a feature in recent strikes by Hollywood actors and writers, with the peace deals that ended those disputes both featuring guardrails on using the technology. However, Perry told the Hollywood Reporter that a \u201cwhole industry\u201d approach was still needed to save jobs. \u201cIt can\u2019t be one union fighting every contract every two or three years. I think that it has to be everybody, all involved in how do we protect the future of our industry because it is changing rapidly, right before our eyes,\u201d he said."

The current extraordinary bid battle for Chippenham-based Wincanton, the last UK-listed logistics firm, shows how the London market \u2013 or part of it \u2013 sometimes doesn\u2019t know how to value what it\u2019s got. A bid at a 52% premium to the previous share price would normally be regarded as juicy if it came at the end of a contested tussle, but Wincanton got that on one day when a French shipping firm, CMA CGM, offered 450p-a-share, or \u00a3567m, last month. Some Wincanton shareholders felt the offer was still too mean (well done, Aberforth), so the French went to 480p to try to clinch things. But now comes a fresh suitor from the US, GXO Logistics, offering 605p. That is 104% more than the old share price of 297p, which shouldn\u2019t happen if a market is liquid and full of active buyers and sellers. We\u2019re not talking about a hard-to-value biotech outfit. Wincanton, with 20,000 employees, is in the business of warehouses and lorries. Yes, there have been a couple of complications in recent years \u2013 the loss of a contract with HMRC to check cross-border goods and a deficit in the pension fund (now resolved) \u2013 but neither should have scrambled the market\u2019s collective brain. Wincanton\u2019s chairman, Sir Martin Read, understandably backed the original French offer on the grounds that the company\u2019s strong financial performance had \u201cnot been reflected in the performance of its shares in recent years\u201d. If Wincanton was an isolated case, one could shrug and say pockets of undervaluation can occur in any market. But, over at Currys, the electrical retailer, a similar tale is unfolding. From a previous 47p, the bids from US hedge fund Elliott have reached 67p per share, an improvement of 42%, and the defending board is still resisting \u2013 quite rightly, many of us would argue (Peel Hunt\u2019s analyst reckons 80p is the point at which Currys would be obliged to engage). Currys\u2019 largest shareholder, Redwheel, which has backed the board, made an excellent point when it said there was a wider problem with a UK equity market \u201cwhich no longer seems to fulfil its primary purpose of price discovery and efficient capital allocation\u201d. Fund manager Ian Lance pointed to the silliness of some big UK investment houses allocating cash away from UK equities, which are close to all-time low valuations, and towards US equities at close to all-time highs. \u201cUnless this changes, it seems likely that we will continue to see overseas corporate buyers step in to take advantage of the depressed valuations of UK equities with ownership falling into foreign hands and the number of quoted UK businesses will continue to decline,\u201d he argued. It\u2019s hard to disagree. A pitch for London is not compelling if it involves paying your advisers a small fortune to get listed and then being ignored for years until a foreign predator turns up. In a rational world, perceived undervaluations would bring forth buyers and the problem would solve itself. Maybe the sight of a 100% takeover premium will help at the margin. But investor indifference towards pockets of small- and medium-sized companies is not new and none of the proposed remedies sounds transformational. Obliging UK pension funds to show more home bias in their equity portfolios would help, but compulsion has its limits. The proposal for a \u201cBritish ISA\u201d, with allocations only to UK-listed stocks, probably wouldn\u2019t shift serious sums. Consolidation among defined-benefit schemes, to produce bigger funds with an appetite to own more UK equities, will not happen overnight. If Schwimmer has more radical ideas, we\u2019d love to hear them. Sadly, he seems more interested in arguing that people such as himself \u2013 those running large FTSE 100 companies \u2013 should be paid more to compete with US rivals. That won\u2019t cure the problems at the other end of the market."

            "date": "2024-02-13T04:22:04Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s most affluent schools are set to rake in more than a billion dollars in commonwealth overfunding, new figures show, with one of them facing controversy over a $108m development proposal. The \u201cstate significant development\u201d lodged with the New South Wales Department of Planning by MLC school in Burwood includes an expansion of its existing aquatic centre and a performing arts and sports centre. The proposal is in its preliminary planning stage. Experts say the application lays bare the inequity of overfunding the private system, amid figures provided at Senate estimates showing the top 10% of private schools ranked by parent incomes were receiving a quarter of ongoing overfunding. The 263 private schools, where the median family income is in excess of $209,000, are expected to receive $1.3bn above the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) to 2029 \u2013 the level agreed to by governments to provide a baseline education. Of those, 92 have a median family income of more than $260,000. The commonwealth has until 2029 to bring funding levels down to their agreed level of 80% for private schools \u2013 with many continuing to be funded well in excess of 100%. In 2024, MLC school received $5.9m in commonwealth funding, the latest data shows, representing 145% of the SRS. In 2022, its funding was at 171% of the SRS. According to the figures, the private girls\u2019 school was overfunded by the commonwealth government to the tune of $2.7m in 2024, while total overfunding from 2022 to 2028 was estimated at $16.3m. According to internal Department of Education figures released last year, 1,152 \u2013 or 40% \u2013 of private schools would continue to be overfunded by billions of dollars to 2029, to an estimated value of $3.2bn. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Three schools with high median family incomes \u2013 Penleigh and Essendon grammar, St Augustine\u2019s college and Haileybury college \u2013 were expected to be overfunded by more than $20m each. According to My Schools data, analysed by Guardian Australia, more than 40 of Australia\u2019s 100 most affluent schools had their funding increased \u2013 not decreased \u2013 from 2021 to 2022, despite some schools seeing a decline in enrolments. Among them was the Frensham school in New South Wales, which had its funding increased by $1.4m despite a minor decline in students. The convener of public education lobby group Save our Schools, Trevor Cobbold, said the MLC development pointed to the \u201cinherent unfairness\u201d of the current school funding model. \u201cWhen they\u2019ve got this amount of overfunding from the taxpayer, it frees up their fee income to be used on luxurious facilities,\u201d Cobbold said. \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous. It points to the inherent unfairness of the current funding model. It\u2019s heavily biased in favour of private schools. \u201cNo government school is overfunded to this extent \u2026 yet taxpayer money goes into this operation for a group of the richest families in the country.\u201d According to figures provided at Senate estimates, the median family income of students at MLC school was $260,000 in 2022. The school receives tuition fees, in addition to government funding, of up to $40,000 a year from each student. The school says it prides itself on its \u201cextensive co-curricular program\u201d that includes diving, fencing, multiple types of gymnastics, tennis, skiing and swimming in its physical education offerings. The architectural plans lodged with the department propose a new two- to four-storey performing arts centre and sports complex, alongside a two- to three-storey extension of its existing aquatic centre. It comes as state and territory education ministers continue talks with the federal government over the next National School Reform Agreement (NSRA). The NSW state government has joined Victoria and Queensland in pushing the commonwealth to increase its contribution to the public system, now sitting at 20%. Last month, Western Australia accepted a deal for the federal government to lift its funding level to 22.5%, less than the 25% pushed for by states and education unions. A spokesperson for the NSW education minister, Prue Car, said the state government \u201cstrongly believes\u201d the commonwealth should put more money on the table so all NSW public schools are fully funded to the SRS by 2025. \u201cSecuring this agreement with the commonwealth will ensure public schools can continue to provide world-class services to the state\u2019s growing cohort of students,\u201d the spokesperson said. Asked whether it was equitable that MLC received $5,873 a student from the commonwealth in 2024, the federal education minister, Jason Clare, said the government was \u201cfocused\u201d on making sure public schools were funded properly, adding the agreement with WA was an \u201cexample of that\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s just the first step,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to fully fund public school across the country.\u201d The Australian Education Union president, Correna Haythorpe, said overfunding by governments was allowing private schools to divert income into \u201cluxury facilities and vanity projects\u201d. She pointed to the fact only 1.3% of public schools were fully funded, none of which were in NSW. The state government has pledged to reach 75% of the SRS by 2025. \u201cIt is a never-ending battle to see who can build the most ostentatious facilities whether it is pools or performing arts centres or libraries that look like Scottish castles,\u201d Haythorpe said. \u201cThe Minns and Albanese governments need to strike a deal this year that ends the underfunding of public schools. \u201cWe are not asking for Olympic pools and polo fields \u2013 just modern, safe classrooms, libraries and learning spaces where teachers can give every child the support they need to succeed.\u201d The Greens spokesperson for schools, Senator Penny Allman-Payne, said it was \u201cpatently unfair\u201d Australia\u2019s wealthiest schools were able to use public money towards \u201cgleaming monuments to their privilege\u201d. MLC school was approached for comment."

            "date": "2024-02-23T14:28:05Z",
            "content": "Eddie Howe does not look, or behave, like a high-stakes gambler but appearances can deceive. In reality Newcastle\u2019s otherwise rather conservative, invariably measured, manager has constructed such a risk-taking team that he readily agrees it is no coincidence his players have faced more fast breaks than any other Premier League side this season. \u201cThere\u2019s always a reason for these things and certainly our high press will be one of those reasons,\u201d said Howe as he reflected on recent Opta statistics. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to limit the opposition threat; we\u2019re going to have to be careful about it.\u201d Yet in recent weeks there has been precious little tactical circumspection on the part of a manager whose hard-pressing team have been caught on the counterattack so many times that they have conceded 27 goals in their past 11 Premier League games, while scoring 21. Although often wonderful to watch, that is not sustainable for a team that retain hopes of European qualification but last kept a clean sheet in the league in mid-December. It also explains why Newcastle supporters are nervous before Saturday night\u2019s visit to title chasing, latterly free-scoring Arsenal. That fanbase has not forgotten Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s post-match comments after Nottingham Forest came to St James\u2019 Park on Boxing Day when Chris Wood scored a hat-trick in the course of a 3-1 away win. \u201cWe knew Newcastle would press very high and that when the moment was there we would spin and go,\u201d said Forest\u2019s manager. \u201cOur plan was counterattacking. If you beat Newcastle\u2019s press, you will have chances against them.\u201d After Forest\u2019s 3-2 home defeat by Howe\u2019s team this month, Nuno reprised that theme. \u201cNewcastle are very aggressive but, if you break their pressure, you\u2019ll have space,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have pace upfront you can take advantage. They are very good but when you understand how they work you can take advantage of their plan.\u201d The concession of four goals to Luton and two against Bournemouth in Newcastle\u2019s past two home draws suggests Howe has been reluctant to modify his approach at a time when a counterattacking philosophy has become many opponents\u2019 default mode \u2013 and not only during trips to Tyneside. Perhaps significantly this season\u2019s Premier League has featured the fourth-highest average number of fast breaks since Opta records began in 2006-07. Only the 2008-09, 2012-2013 and 2013-14 campaigns witnessed more collective speedy counterattacking. Newcastle\u2019s particular vulnerability to such gameplans may be partly down to opponents fathoming out the aggressive press which took so many rivals by surprise as Howe\u2019s team finished fourth last spring. Although Newcastle are far from a mirror image of Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s Leeds there are certain parallels with the rise and fall of the Argentinian\u2019s once revered, yet ultimately self-destructively high-intensity, side. Howe \u2013 whose motto remains \u201cintensity is our identity\u201d \u2013 would argue his biggest problem is the injury epidemic which has derailed Newcastle\u2019s season. The key question though is whether his ultra-demanding blueprint is responsible for the sidelining of so many important players. Last season Joelinton and Joe Willock were integral to the high press\u2019s successful function and their absence from midfield \u2013 Joelinton will not be fit until the summer and Willock is set to make a comeback at Arsenal after a lengthy layoff \u2013 has exposed a lack of pace in defence. Despite Martin Dubravka\u2019s shot-stopping excellence, the injured first-choice goalkeeper, Nick Pope, is more comfortable with the sweeper-keeper approach that helped insulate the back four last term. Dubravka remains far less comfortable outside the six-yard box. Meanwhile Dan Burn, Newcastle\u2019s left-back, has been repeatedly caught out by a series of fleet-footed right-wingers, most recently Bournemouth\u2019s Antoine Semenyo and Luton\u2019s Chiedozie Ogbene. While Howe presumably ponders whether to drop Burn at Arsenal and offer the impressive Tino Livramento a rare start \u2013 or even retain Burn\u2019s aerial ability at set pieces by switching to a back three \u2013 neutrals have hailed the apparent return of Kevin Keegan\u2019s famous \u201cEntertainers\u201d to Tyneside. Howe adored that team and even seemed a little star-struck when he recently met Keegan but his Newcastle are no identikits of the ensemble that finished Premier League runners-up in 1995-96. For all their abundant attacking flair, that team conceded only 37 league goals during a season when the eventual champions, Manchester United, let in 35. One of the reasons for the class of 2023-24\u2019s defensive difficulties is arguably Howe\u2019s reluctance to settle for a draw. After the defeat by Milan at St James\u2019 Park that prompted their Champions League exit in December Howe, typically, \u201crefused to apologise\u201d for chasing victory rather than pursuing the point that would have guaranteed Europa League involvement. Perhaps tellingly, in 25 league games this season Newcastle have won 11, lost 10 and drawn only four. A similar \u201call or nothing\u201d credo is expected at Arsenal. \u201cWe\u2019re desperate to try to close the gap on the teams above us,\u201d said Howe. \u201cWe\u2019ll do everything in our power to win.\u201d"

            "content": "Israel and Hamas are making progress towards a deal that would bring about a ceasefire and free hostages held in the Gaza Strip, officials with knowledge of the talks have said. The US national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, speaking as negotiations were held in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, said: \u201cThey\u2019ve been constructive and moving in the right direction.\u201d The talks came as calls grew for Israel not to go ahead with a planned assault on the territory\u2019s southernmost city, Rafah, crammed with more than a million displaced people. Israel has faced a mounting wave of international criticism for its conduct of the war in Gaza and for settler violence in the occupied West Bank. Calling Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza \u201cdisproportionate\u201d, the Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said there were \u201ctoo many victims\u201d in Gaza, as South Africa \u2013 which has lodged a genocide complaint against Israel at the international court of justice \u2013 returned to the ICJ to demand it take action over recent attacks on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. On Tuesday, France became the latest country \u2013 after the US and the UK \u2013 to announce it was imposing sanctions against several dozen Israeli settlers involved in violent acts targeting Palestinians. Israeli tanks shelled the eastern sector of Rafah, while Gaza health officials said an Israeli strike on a house in Nusseirat refugee camp in central Gaza killed 16 people. Late on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces released a video that it said showed Hamas\u2019s chief in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, and his family, being led through a tunnel. The black and white footage filmed on 10 October is said to be the first images of Sinwar to emerge since the unprecedented 7 October attack on Israel, which he is accused of masterminding. As the talks in Cairo got under way there were reports that the CIA director, William Burns, was flying in to join teams from Hamas and Israel for negotiations over a ceasefire and prisoner exchange as international pressure increases to advance the talks. Israel\u2019s delegation includes its heads of intelligence, David Barnea of the Mossad and Ronen Bar, the director of Shin Bet. Also attending are the Egyptian intelligence director, Abbas Kamel, and the Qatari prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani. A senior Egyptian official said the meeting would focus on crafting a final draft of a six-week ceasefire deal, with guarantees that the parties would continue negotiations toward a permanent ceasefire amid suggestions of progress. Egypt\u2019s intelligence agency has acted as a significant interlocutor in past conflicts between Hamas and Israel, while Burns\u2019s presence is seen as underlining US pressure for an end to hostilities. A US official, quoted in the New York Times, said Burns was travelling to Cairo after Joe Biden said on Monday that he was pressing for a deal including a ceasefire of at least six weeks in exchange for the release of the remaining hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. The hostages were seized in the 7 October raid on southern Israel by Hamas militants, which killed 1,200 people and triggered Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza. Securing their return is a priority for the government of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, along with eradicating Hamas, which controls Gaza. \u201cThe key element of the deals are on the table,\u201d Biden told journalists at a briefing alongside the visiting Jordanian king, Abdullah II. \u201cThere are gaps that remain, but I\u2019ve encouraged Israeli leaders to keep working to achieve the deal,\u201d he said, adding that Israel should not launch a ground offensive into the southern Gaza city of Rafah without a \u201ccredible plan\u201d to safeguard the 1.4 million displaced civilians sheltering there. Israel\u2019s suggestion that it will attack Rafah next has triggered widespread international opposition, with a senior UN official on Tuesday saying that the UN would not participate in a forced evacuation. A western diplomat in the Egyptian capital also said a six-week deal was on the table but cautioned that more work was needed to reach an agreement. Netanyahu has publicly insisted on a hardline position, saying Israel would continue its offensive until total victory. However, behind the scenes, officials have suggested that progress was being made in negotiations for a second, longer ceasefire, according to two officials with direct knowledge of the talks. Talks are moving forward even after Israel intensified its offensive in Rafah. An Israeli hostage rescue mission freed two captives held in the town along the Egyptian border, in a raid that killed at least 74 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and left a trail of destruction. A deal would give people in Gaza a desperately needed respite from the war, now in its fifth month, and offer freedom for at least some of the 100-plus hostages. Efforts to bring about a deal have so been hobbled by the disparate positions of Hamas and Israel. Israel has proposed a two-month ceasefire, in which hostages would be freed in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, and top Hamas leaders in Gaza would be allowed to move to other countries. Hamas rejected those terms and has laid out a three-phase plan of 45 days each in which the hostages would be released in stages, Israel would free hundreds of imprisoned Palestinians, including senior militants, and the war would be wound down, with Israel withdrawing its troops. A deal in late November brought about a brief truce allowing the release of about 100 hostages in Gaza in exchange for about 240 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The threatened Israeli offensive against Rafah has triggered mounting alarm among those who have sought shelter in the city. Samah, a mother-of-two who is a senior programme officer for ActionAid, said she was sharing a tent with 20 family members in Rafah after her home in Gaza City was destroyed. \u201cThey [the IDF] asked us to go outside Gaza City to the south so we went to Khan Younis. We spent two months in Khan Younis and after that they told us we have to be evacuated to Rafah. She said people in Rafah are terrified at the prospect of an all-out military assault on the town where 1.3 million are sheltering. \u201cIt\u2019s very scary. It would be a disaster, more than the disaster that we are already living in. Most of Gaza\u2019s people are in Rafah now. There are a lot of people here in tents and we don\u2019t know where we can evacuate,\u201d she said."

The Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz has said there are \u201cpromising early signs of progress\u201d on a new deal to release hostages from Gaza amid regional talks to secure a pause in the war. His comments came as US media reported that the CIA chief, William Burns, was expected in Paris for hostage talks. Meanwhile, the US has urged the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague not to issue a ruling calling for Israel\u2019s immediate withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories, arguing that Israeli security had to be taken into account in any solution to the conflict. \u201cAny movement towards Israel\u2019s withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza requires consideration for Israel\u2019s very real security needs,\u201d Richard Visek, the state department\u2019s acting legal adviser, told the ICJ judges.

Videos show migrants stripped of clothing in freezing temperatures at Serbian border Videos appearing to show groups of men stripped of their clothing in near-freezing temperatures and being forced back from the Serbian border into North Macedonia are evidence of escalating mistreatment of migrants at European borders, according to human rights groups. Two videos shown to the Guardian by Legis, a North Macedonian NGO, show a line of semi-naked men on a stretch of road near the Serbian-North Macedonian border. Legis says the videos were filmed by a local person near the village of Lojane, close to the Serbian border, and handed to them on 10 February. The Guardian has not independently verified the videos. The NGO claims the incident was the second of two abusive and \u201cdegrading\u201d pushbacks over a 24-hour period, when it claims more than 50 people were forced to strip naked or down to their underwear by the Serbian authorities before being forced back into North Macedonia. What has Dunja Mijatovi\u0107, the commissioner for human rights at the Council of Europe, said about the footage? Mijatovi\u0107 said the abuse that appeared to be happening on the North Macedonian border was indicative of mistreatment of vulnerable people on borders across Europe, calling the widespread phenomenon of illegal pushbacks an \u201curgent pan-European problem\u201d. Biden comments a disgrace, says Kremlin, after he calls Putin a \u2018crazy SOB\u2019 The Kremlin has accused Joe Biden of debasing himself and disgracing his country after the US president called Vladimir Putin a \u201ccrazy SOB\u201d during a fundraiser in San Francisco. Biden was talking about the climate crisis yesterday when he said: \u201cWe have a crazy SOB like Putin and others, and we always have to worry about nuclear conflict, but the existential threat to humanity is climate.\u201d The Kremlin said Biden\u2019s comments were a \u201cdisgrace for the United States\u201d. \u201cThe use of such language against the head of another state by the president of the United States is unlikely to infringe on our president, President Putin,\u201d said the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov. \u201cBut it debases those who use such vocabulary.\u201d What did Biden say about Donald Trump\u2019s comments about Alexei Navalny? \u201cSome of the things that this fellow\u2019s been saying, like he\u2019s comparing himself to Navalny and saying that \u2013 because our country\u2019s become a communist country, he was persecuted, just like Navalny was persecuted. I don\u2019t know where the hell this comes from,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI mean, if I stood here 10, 15 years ago and said any of this, you\u2019d all think I should be committed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt astounds me.\u201d In other news \u2026 The former Brazil soccer star Dani Alves was found guilty of sexually assaulting a young woman and sentenced to four years, six months in prison today.

            "title": "John Fetterman: progressive senator perhaps not that progressive after all",
            "date": "2024-02-05T12:00:57Z",
            "content": "There was a time when John Fetterman, the rough-and-ready Pennsylvania senator, was a budding star of the left. Endorsed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in his 2022 Democratic race, Fetterman had supported the democratic socialist Bernie Sanders for president in 2016. On the campaign trail, Fetterman said he would fight for an increased minimum wage, while he had previously suggested he wanted to see the implementation of universal healthcare. But in recent months, Fetterman has come under attack from the left for his enthusiastic support for Israel and continued US funding to its war in Gaza. The criticism has come alongside praise from Republicans for Fetterman\u2019s chiding of some Democrats over what he has called a \u201ccrisis at our border\u201d. The growing distance between Fetterman and the left of his party came to a head in December. \u201cI\u2019m not a progressive, I\u2019m just a regular Democrat,\u201d Fetterman wrote on X that same month. But although Fetterman did not openly embrace the progressive designation in his 2022 Senate race, people on X noticed an inconsistency: Fetterman\u2019s post was flagged with readers\u2019 context pointing to his previous posts where he described himself as a \u201cprogressive Democrat\u201d. In the years before he was elected, Fetterman offered enough evidence that he was to the left of the party to leave supporters feeling short-changed. As lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania \u2013 he was elected in 2018 after running as a progressive \u2013 he pushed for clemency in some cases where people had been sentenced to life imprisonment. When he was mayor of Braddock, the town of 2,000 people in western Pennsylvania, he defied state law by marrying same-sex couples in his home. That history, coupled with his frequent, fierce defenses of Pennsylvania\u2019s election system on TV in the wake of the 2020 presidential election, inspired progressives to support him. Fetterman never fully fitted all aspects of the progressive mantle. As a candidate in 2022, he spoke enthusiastically about his support for Israel, but his actions since the 7 October Hamas attacks, and Israel\u2019s subsequent response, coupled with his adjustment on border issues, has brought political scrutiny. It has prompted gossip, too. Fetterman\u2019s wife, Gisele Fetterman, who became a prominent surrogate for him during the Senate campaign after Fetterman had a stroke, deleted her social media accounts in January. Fetterman had spoken of his wife\u2019s immigration story during his campaigns. Gisele Fetterman moved to the US when she was seven as an undocumented immigrant with her mother and brother, before acquiring a green card in 2004 and US citizenship in 2009. That backstory prompted rebuke after Fetterman told the rightwing New York Post \u201cthere is a crisis\u201d of migration. \u201cWe have a crisis at our border, and it can\u2019t be controversial that we should have a secure border,\u201d he said last month. Gisele Fetterman has since returned to social media, explaining her absence by saying she was \u201cbored of it\u201d \u2013 and the pair have posted pictures of themselves together, but the critics have not stopped. The events of January 26 didn\u2019t help, when Fetterman appeared to mock people who were protesting against the killing of 26,000 people in Gaza by waving a giant Israel flag at them. (The New York Post gleefully reported that Fetterman, a \u201cprogressive-hating Democrat\u201d, \u201cnever misses an opportunity to mock\u201d the left.) There were always some distinctions between Fetterman and his more progressive colleagues, however. While he was endorsed by Ocasio-Cortez in his Senate race, he said during the campaign that he would not be a member of the \u201cSquad\u201d, the group of progressive Democrats in Congress. When he was running for Senate, he was praised by the left for his statements on reforming the criminal justice system, but criticized for pledging his support for fracking. He had given fair warning, too, about where he might stand on Israel. \u201cWhenever I\u2019m in a situation to be called on to take up the cause of strengthening and enhancing the security of Israel or deepening our relationship between the United States and Israel, I\u2019m going to lean in,\u201d Fetterman told Jewish Insider in 2022. Still, the apparent move away from being a perceived leftwing ally has plenty upset, and Fetterman is doing little to soothe his former supporters. As people have watched with increasing horror as Israel has bombarded Gaza, Fetterman told Semafor in January that \u201cIsrael is really a beacon of the kind of values, the American values and progressive ideals, that you want to see\u201d. And as Republicans have called for severe restrictions on migrants crossing the border reform, Fetterman has defended working with the Republican party. If Fetterman was once a progressive, it seems that he definitely is not any longer."

            "title": "How Biden \u2018erased\u2019 progress he made and alienated the left",
            "date": "2024-02-11T11:00:09Z",
            "content": "In front of a giant banner that said \u201cRestore Roe\u201d, Joe Biden was holding his first rally of the year in Manassas, Virginia, to campaign for abortion rights, a top issue for Democrats in this year\u2019s election. But Biden did not receive the universal affirmation he might once have expected. His 22-minute speech was interrupted at least a dozen times by protesters scattered throughout the audience who rose to shout out demands for a ceasefire in Gaza. It was a jarring collision that revealed a president who stands accused of befriending then betraying the left \u2013 and now risks losing a critical part of his coalition. The disillusionment is all the keener because Biden defied expectations early in his White House term, signing landmark legislation to alleviate poverty and tackle the climate crisis that thrilled his progressive wing. But with an election looming, critics say, he is gravitating back towards his comfort zone in the centre ground, and his refusal to call for a ceasefire in Gaza has caused particular fury. \u201cProgressives in the movement were pleasantly surprised to see President Biden push on a lot of domestic progressive priorities that we have been calling for,\u201d said Usamah Andrabi, communications director of the progressive group Justice Democrats. \u201cBut without question he has erased much of that progress with his continued support for a genocide that\u2019s happening at the hands of a far-right Israeli government.\u201d *** Biden, 81, was long perceived as a middle-of-the-road moderate, representing Delaware for 36 years in the Senate before serving as Barack Obama\u2019s vice-president. He came under scrutiny for a cosy relationship with the banking sector, his role in drawing up a 1994 crime bill that ushered in an era of mass incarceration and his failure to protect witness Anita Hill during Clarence Thomas\u2019s supreme court confirmation hearing. Yet once Biden reached the White House in 2021, he proved more ambitious than many expected. He appointed progressives to his administration, the most diverse in history, and the first Black woman \u2013 Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2013 to the supreme court, along with numerous judges of colour. He gained further credit on the anti-war left by pulling US troops out of Afghanistan after two decades. The coronavirus pandemic invited him to turn a crisis into an opportunity. Biden delivered trillions of dollars to boost domestic manufacturing, invest in infrastructure and combat the climate crisis. His lifelong support of trade unions came to the fore. A Wall Street Journal column, arguing that he would effectively run for a re-election in 2024 as a democratic socialist, offered the headline: \u201cJoe Biden Is Bernie Sanders.\u201d But there were seeds of discontent. Some observers felt Biden could have used different tools to fulfill his promise of widespread student loan forgiveness, a plan ultimately struck down by the supreme court. There was disappointment that he did not use his bully pulpit more effectively to push Congress to pass police reform and voting rights legislation. Biden also received criticism for fist-bumping the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who approved the 2018 assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Even on climate, critics say, his record remains decidedly mixed. The Inflation Reduction Act directs $394bn to clean energy, the biggest such investment in history, and just last month the president ordered a pause on exports of liquefied natural gas, hailed as \u201ca watershed moment\u201d by activist and author Bill McKibben. Yet Biden also approved the Willow oil-drilling project in a remote part of northern Alaska. Indeed, he has rubber stamped more oil and gas drilling permits on federal land than Donald Trump at the same stage of his presidency. US oil production reached an all-time high last year. Stevie O\u2019Hanlon, spokesperson for climate-focused youth group Sunrise Movement, said: \u201cThe way that Joe Biden is acting right now, if it continues for the next nine months, is a recipe for him losing millions of votes from young people and losing the election. \u201cSo many young people have been frustrated with Biden for approving new fossil fuel projects. His administration has made some important shifts around Fema [Federal Emergency Management Agency] rules, for instance, around air pollution. But while he\u2019s making these steps forward, he\u2019s also taking these really loud steps back that honestly made many young people more disillusioned with him than less.\u201d Last month progressives condemned Biden\u2019s decision to launch retaliatory strikes against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. They argued that he violated the constitution by not seeking congressional approval first and was breaking his promise to keep America out of intractable wars in the Middle East. Meanwhile the president threw his weight behind a bipartisan Senate bill to tighten border security \u2013 and send military aid to Israel and Ukraine \u2013 which would severely curtail migration and limit asylum in a way that broke a campaign promise. Biden even adopted Republican language, saying he would \u201cshut down the border\u201d when he was given the authority to do so. Andrabi of Justice Democrats said of the bill, which failed in the Senate: \u201cWe saw Biden work with mostly Republicans and Kyrsten Sinema, who has left the Democratic party, zero Hispanic caucus members, zero border state Democrats to craft a Trump-like Republican anti-immigration bill that Republicans were never going to vote for. \u201cTo prove what? Maybe that he\u2019s willing to treat migrant families like Trump did, as long as it comes with funding for war. That\u2019s not sufficient. That is not progressive. That is not even core Democratic.\u201d But nothing has done more to drive a wedge between Biden and the left than the war in Gaza triggered by Hamas\u2019s attacks in Israel on 7 October that left 1,200 people dead and more than 240 taken hostage. He championed Israel\u2019s right to defend itself and only gradually voiced concerns about its rightwing government\u2019s destructive military campaign that has killed more than 27,000 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. A recent NBC News poll found 15% of voters under 35 approve of Biden\u2019s handling of the war while 70% disapprove. Protesters disrupted his speech at Mother Emanuel AME Church in South Carolina as the president spoke out against racism, at a United Auto Workers gathering in Washington and at a political event in Columbia, South Carolina. It is a vivid schism as the president, already facing concerns over his age, gears up for a hard fought race for the White House. Norman Solomon, national director of RootsAction.org, said: \u201cA lot of independents and Democrats are sickened in a gut punch sort of a way. Biden is so out of touch with the base that he absolutely will need this fall to be re-elected. Young people are more politicised and more energised than ever before and some of these Gaza demonstrations are propelled by young people turning out. They\u2019re just disgusted with Biden and it didn\u2019t have to be this way.\u201d Activists in Dearborn, Michigan, for example, are urging people to cast an \u201cUncommitted\u201d vote in the Democratic primary election on 27 February to demand that Biden support a ceasefire and end to funding the war in Gaza. Thirty-three Michigan government officials have signed an open letter pledging to check the \u201cUncommitted\u201d option on their ballots. Layla Elabed, a Palestinian American activist who is managing the campaign, said: \u201cBiden and his administration and the Democratic party have abandoned us, the pro-ceasefire and anti-war voters and constituency, and they have abandoned humanitarian politics. Democrats and Joe Biden no longer represent where we are at. \u201cThe institution of the Democratic party hasn\u2019t delivered; it\u2019s moved away from what people are advocating for. They have money in their pockets and blood on their hands. Biden\u2019s funding of Netanyahu\u2019s war makes a mockery of the president\u2019s claim that he would fight authoritarianism and be for democracy.\u201d *** The backlash threatens Biden\u2019s chances of re-election, not because progressives will switch from him to likely opponent Trump in decisive numbers, but because a sliver might choose to sit out the election or turn to a third party candidate such as Cornel West \u2013 potentially enough to make all the difference in Michigan and other swing states in the electoral college. Jeremy Varon, a history professor at the the New School for Social Research in New York, said: \u201cPart of me thinks that Biden has basically given up on reassembling on the Obama coalition and decided that the number that they lose among progressives and the young they will make up with [Nikki] Haley Republicans, moderates and independents. \u201cSince there\u2019s no meaningful primary, he doesn\u2019t have to appeal to the base. All of that makes for a campaign where he\u2019s going to run to the centre and progressives are going to feel very much in the wilderness.\u201d For the third election in a row, progressives are confronted with the argument that a vote for anyone but the Democratic nominee is effectively a vote for Trump, a man who has demonised immigrants, vowed to shut down the border immediately and resume construction of a border wall. There is no reason to believe that he would urge Israel to exercise restraint in Gaza. Varon added: \u201cPeople on the left like me who are terrified of a Trumpian re-election are trying to build a persuasive argument to bracket your values and pull the lever for Biden, even though you might think his Gaza policy is immoral. \u201cThis is the most acute case of progressives wrangling with how you square your conscience with the pragmatic necessity of preventing the worst alternative from assuming the White House. This has been with the American left for decades. Do we vote for the Democrat?\u201d For Elaine Kamarck, a former official in the Bill Clinton White House, the answer has to be yes. She said: \u201cDonald Trump has a miraculous way of uniting the Democratic party. People understand what a fundamental threat he is to democracy, to everything that the centre to the far left believes in and it\u2019s sheer folly to vote against Biden.\u201d A dulling of the early optimism about Biden\u2019s progressivism may have been inevitable as the presidential election loomed. When Republicans won the House in the 2022 midterm elections, the window of opportunity for sweeping legislation slammed shut. The war in Ukraine has consumed huge time and resources. The cracks between Biden and a younger generation over Israel were always there but it took the Hamas attack to bring them to the surface. Matt Bennett, an executive vice-president of the centrist thinktank Third Way, describes Biden as a moderate by disposition who believes in compromise. \u201cHe\u2019s governed the way he promised he would when he ran for president, the way he has always portrayed himself, which is somebody who\u2019s at the centre of the Democratic electorate,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not on the liberal fringe; he is not a conservative Democrat. He\u2019s always navigated to about the middle point of where the party is. That\u2019s why he got there before Obama did on marriage equality, famously, because he saw where the party was headed and that\u2019s where he has steered quite successfully as president. No one\u2019s going to be happy with him all the time but most Democrats should appreciate that he\u2019s done an extraordinarily good job.\u201d But Andrabi of Justice Democrats is less sanguine. He warns that Biden is failing to follow the will of the voters who elected him \u2013 and could pay a price. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that the Biden administration and Democratic leadership listen to those voters who are screaming at the top of their lungs in rallies, in meetings, everywhere they go that the current state of the Biden administration\u2019s policies in Gaza, on immigration, on climate change is insufficient for core bases of their voters that got President Biden elected, that got Democrats a majority in the Senate and that is going to be crucial to getting Democrats to flip the House. \u201cBut they\u2019re not listening and lip service is not going to convince anyone when what we are seeing on the other side is nearly 30,000 dead Palestinians, let alone the ongoing existential crisis of climate change or an immigration system that is broken and their solution is to criminalise more folks. None of these are what the core base of the Democratic voters support.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-08T19:26:14Z",
            "content": "Labour has cut its green investment plans by half, ending weeks of speculation and confirming the biggest and most controversial U-turn of Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership. In a move that prompted an angry response from environmental groups, unions and some in the energy sector, Starmer and Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, jointly announced they would slash the green prosperity plan from \u00a328bn a year to under \u00a315bn \u2013 only a third of which would be new money. It ended a protracted internal battle within Labour over the policy, with some senior officials urging Starmer to stick to his green commitments and others warning it would be an electoral liability. While intended to shield against repeated Conservative attacks on the scale of borrowing required, the climbdown infuriated environmental campaigners, who said it would push up costs in the long term and make it harder for Labour to reach ambitious green targets. The Unite union said Labour risked \u201coutsourcing their policymaking to the Conservatives\u201d, while the energy industry\u2019s trade group said it was concerned about the reduced ambition for \u201cthe future of our sector in the UK\u201d. Speaking to reporters in Westminster, Starmer said: \u201cWe will not reach the \u00a328bn \u2013 the \u00a328bn, therefore, is stood down and we focus on the outcomes. We want to get to that place because at the moment all you are ever asked about is the size of the cheque and we want to have an argument about the outcomes, which is what matters.\u201d He added: \u201cWe announced the \u00a328bn two and a half years or so ago, when interest rates were very, very low. Since then, Liz Truss crashed the economy and other damage has been done. [Interest rates] are now very, very high \u2013 interest on government debt is already tens of billions of pounds a year. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said we have to be within the fiscal rules and fiscal rules come first.\u201d Labour announced the \u00a328bn spending plan in 2021, as Reeves promised to be the UK\u2019s \u201cfirst green chancellor\u201d. She said at the time the money would be spent on battery manufacturing, hydrogen power, offshore wind, tree planting, flood defences and home insulation. Since then the party has come under increasing attack over the plan, as Starmer and Reeves struggled to explain how they could stick to the spending commitment and keep a separate promise to cut government debt levels in the long term. The Guardian revealed last week that Starmer had decided to scale back the plan after lengthy internal discussion and heavy lobbying from aides, such as Morgan McSweeney, Labour\u2019s campaign chief, who said sticking to it would be an electoral liability. Ed Miliband, the shadow net zero secretary, had pushed back against diluting the plan. There was even speculation, denied by his team, that he could resign over the issue. However, in a sign of unity, he contributed a quote to the press release confirming the U-turn. Starmer had continued to cite the \u00a328bn target as recently as Tuesday, telling Times Radio it was \u201cdesperately needed\u201d for the party\u2019s mission of achieving clean power by 2030. On Thursday, he told reporters he no longer believed this was needed. Instead, Labour would spend just over \u00a34.7bn a year, on top of \u00a310bn of green schemes it says the government has already committed to. About half of that money would come from changes to the government\u2019s oil and gas windfall tax, with Labour planning to raise the rate from 75% to 78% and extend it until the end of the parliament. The other half would come from new borrowing. The biggest cuts have been to the party\u2019s home insulation scheme. Labour had previously promised to spend up to \u00a36bn a year insulating 19m homes over a decade. Under the revised plans Starmer and Reeves intend to spend just \u00a36.6bn over the parliament \u2013 an average of \u00a31.3bn a year. The cuts will mean the party reducing its targets for the number of properties it can insulate. Starmer said Labour now intended to insulate 5m homes over the first five years of government, and that it would take as long as 14 years to reach the 19m target. Other schemes, including a \u00a37.3bn national wealth fund and an \u00a38.3bn national energy supplier called Great British Energy, will remain, in an effort to meet the clean power pledge. Reeves said: \u201cSomething had to give if we were going to be within our fiscal rules and to achieve clean power by 2030. We have got to get on with the national wealth fund and GB Energy, and so we have scaled back our ambition on warm homes.\u201d Labour\u2019s U-turn dismayed many green campaigners, who said their energy targets would be difficult to hit without the promised level of spending. Areeba Hamid, the co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, said Starmer had \u201ccaved like a house of cards in the wind\u201d. Mike Childs, the head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said Labour had \u201cturned its back on the people who most urgently need these essential upgrades \u2013 the many millions of low-income households suffering from living in poorly insulated homes\u201d. Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry, said the issue was less the actual sum spent than \u201cthe signal it sends\u201d. She said: \u201cThe party has been engaging constructively with business over recent months, but retaining the confidence of the market is dependent on not making U-turns that damage the UK\u2019s investability.\u201d A number of Labour MPs simply expressed relief that the policy had been decided. One shadow cabinet minister said: \u201cThe policy is the main thing. To put a number on it was always a hostage to fortune with a flatlining economy and a government spending all that it has.\u201d"

            "content": "Currys has rejected a takeover bid from the US investment group Elliott, saying the offer significantly undervalued its business. Elliott, which owns the book chain Waterstones and has a controlling stake in the food chain Wasabi, tabled an unsolicited \u00a3700m bid for the electrical goods retailer \u2013 at 62p a share, a 32% premium to its latest share price. Currys was valued at \u00a3533m at the close of trading on the London stock market on Friday. A deal would heighten fears that London\u2019s status as a premier listings market is under threat, with the number of listed companies shrinking by more than 12% during the past three years, according to the Quoted Companies Alliance. A spate of takeovers by US and European private equity firms could continue this year while sterling remains weak. Last year, the Swedish private equity firm EQT bought Yorkshire-based Dechra Pharmaceuticals in a \u00a34.5bn deal, while US-based CVC bought the retailer Ted Baker for \u00a3300m. Currys said in a statement: \u201cThe board confirms that it received an unsolicited, preliminary and conditional proposal from Elliott regarding a possible cash offer. \u201c[We] considered the proposal, together with [our] financial advisers, and concluded that it significantly undervalued the company and its future prospects.\u201d In 2021, Currys shifted its strategy to merge the four brands it operated \u2013 which included PC World, Dixons and Carphone Warehouse \u2013 into one master brand. In November last year, Currys struck a \u00a3175m deal to sell its Greek business. During the pandemic, the retailer closed the 531 Carphone Warehouse stores it owned in the UK, with the loss of 2,900 jobs. Currys now employs more than 15,000 people in the UK, trading from about 300 stores. In 2018, Currys hired Shop Direct\u2019s Alex Baldock as chief executive after Sebastian James resigned from the role to run Boots. Currys was founded in 1884 by Henry Curry as a bicycle-building business before diversifying into the sale of toys, gramophones and radios when it listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1927. News of the takeover bid was first reported by Sky News."

            "date": "2024-02-08T19:36:00Z",
            "content": "Labour has ditched its pledge to spend \u00a328bn a year on green investment, blaming the Conservatives for \u201ccrashing the economy\u201d. The policy, the main component of Labour\u2019s green prosperity plan, has been at the centre of a public and private struggle since it was announced, with factions inside the party arguing against moves to water it down. The plan has now been drastically scaled back to under \u00a315bn a year, only a third of which \u2013 just over \u00a34.7bn a year \u2013 would be new money. Below are some of the key moments leading up to this point. 27 September 2021 Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, pledges to become the UK\u2019s first \u201cgreen chancellor\u201d and invest \u00a328bn a year for the rest of the decade, in front of cheering Labour members at the party\u2019s conference in Brighton. 23 September 2022 Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s disastrous mini-budget leads to what is later estimated to be a \u00a330bn fiscal black hole, setting the scene for a recalibration of Labour\u2019s own spending plans and pledges. 9 June 2023 Labour scales back plans to borrow \u00a328bn a year to invest in green jobs and industry. Citing the poor economic backdrop and interest rate rises since the Truss mini-budget, Reeves delays plans for a green prosperity fund to start in the first year of a Labour government. December Discussions within Labour about scaling back the \u00a328bn plans increase amid fears the Conservatives will use the policy as a central line of attack in the general election campaign. But sources also express concern about how a Labour government would improve economic growth without the green plan, and whether it could leave Keir Starmer open to charges of \u201cflip-flopping\u201d by the Tories. 31 January 2024 A pushback against plans to water down the pledge gathers pace among leading economists and business experts. J\u00fcrgen Maier, the former UK head of Siemens and a figure advising Labour on transport and infrastructure, describes \u00a328bn a year as an \u201cabsolute minimum\u201d. 1 February 2024 The Guardian reveals that the \u00a328bn a year pledge is to be ditched. Asked 10 times on Sky News if she backed the target, Reeves refuses to use the number at all, saying instead: \u201cThe importance of economic and fiscal stability \u2026 will always come first.\u201d Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, says the figure remains an ambition but it is unclear \u201cif we can get there\u201d. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, all but confirms a day later that the commitment is going. 6 February Starmer says in a Times Radio interview that the pledge to spend \u00a328bn a year is \u201cdesperately needed\u201d, as he reopens the issue and supporters view his comments as a recommitment. The Labour frontbencher Chris Bryant says a day later: \u201cOn the \u00a328bn, we are not scaling back. We intend to deliver that.\u201d 7 February Bryant, the shadow culture minister, says in a morning interview that Labour will spend \u00a328bn. Hours later, after prime minister\u2019s questions in parliament, a Labour spokesperson tells reporters the party is committed to \u201c\u00a328bn, subject to the fiscal rules and subject to what the government leave on the table\u201d. 8 February Labour confirms the party does not now believe it will be able to meet the commitment of \u00a328bn a year in its green prosperity plan, blaming the Conservatives for \u201ccrashing\u201d the economy, and what it described as the government\u2019s plan to \u201cmax out the country\u2019s credit card\u201d. Instead, Labour \u201creconfirms\u201d its commitment to policies under the plan to create jobs and cut bills. It says the policies would represent \u00a323.7bn of investment over the course of the next parliament, funded in large part by a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, with the remainder coming through borrowing within its fiscal rules."

            "date": "2024-02-07T18:52:01Z",
            "content": "Keir Starmer will announce on Thursday that he is scaling back Labour\u2019s \u00a328bn green investment programme, in his biggest policy U-turn since becoming party leader. Senior Labour sources have told the Guardian that Starmer will finally confirm the party is no longer planning to spend \u00a328bn a year on environmental schemes, given the economic uncertainty caused by the Conservative government. It follows weeks of uncertainty about the policy as competing factions within Starmer\u2019s senior team pushed him to keep the pledge or ditch it. Starmer has insisted for several weeks that he still intended to meet the pledge, which was first made in 2021 as part of a promise that Labour would be the greenest government in history. But doing so has become far more difficult since it was made, given that the worsening fiscal outlook has left less room to borrow more without long-term debt levels going up. Some shadow ministers have urged Starmer for months to drop the target, arguing that it plays into Conservative attacks about Labour\u2019s fiscal credibility. Others have warned that doing so will only accentuate the feeling among many voters that Starmer cannot be trusted to stick to his word. It is the latest in a series of major policy reversals since he became Labour leader, including dropping a promise to scrap university tuition fees and to impose higher rates of income tax on top earners. Recent media briefings by shadow ministers have led to speculation of a split between Starmer and his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves. Reeves was asked repeatedly about the pledge in an interview with Sky News last week but failed to mention the \u00a328bn on 10 separate occasions. Starmer on the other hand had used the figure as recently as this week, when he told Times Radio: \u201cWe want to have clean power by 2030 \u2026 That\u2019s where the \u00a328bn comes in, that investment that is desperately needed for that mission.\u201d Labour sources said last week that the pledge was now \u201cdead\u201d, an assessment that was bolstered by comments from Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, that the target would now \u201cmove around\u201d. Party officials have previously indicated they would keep the core mission of investing in green infrastructure, as well as previously announced plans such as the creation of GB Energy, a publicly owned clean energy company. The opposition also intends to spend up to \u00a36bn a year on a home insulation scheme, although that also remains subject to the party\u2019s most important fiscal rule \u2013 to have debt falling as a percentage of economic output by the end of the five-year period. The \u00a36bn plan triggered a separate row on Wednesday after an official government analysis claimed it would actually cost double that. Labour said this was \u201cnonsense\u201d, saying it had never claimed all the money would come from central government. But some experts warned that even with the kind of private investment Labour says it can bring in, it will not be able to hit its target of insulating 19m homes in a decade. The row over the insulation scheme helped highlight the broader questions around the party\u2019s overall green investment plans. In recent weeks, senior Conservatives have claimed that sticking to the \u00a328bn figure would mean a probable tax rise. Those attacks have worried some around Starmer, including Morgan McSweeney, Labour\u2019s director of campaigns, and Pat McFadden, the party\u2019s campaigns coordinator. McSweeney recently warned shadow ministers about the possibility that Labour could slump in the polls in the final weeks before an election if the party makes promises it is not able to fully defend. While scaling back the green prosperity plan has been under consideration for some weeks, dropping the \u00a328bn annual target, unveiled with great fanfare by Reeves at the Labour conference in 2021, is politically risky for Starmer and his team. Sunak accused Starmer on Wednesday of being a serial flip-flopper. In comments that were otherwise overshadowed by his controversial remarks about trans people, the prime minister said: \u201cIt is a bit rich to hear about promises from someone who has broken every single promise he was elected on.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-29T14:00:21Z",
            "content": "A surge in employment combined with scant investment by firms to improve output triggered a sharp drop in worker productivity, limiting prospects for income growth without fanning inflation, the Productivity Commission said in its annual report. Across the economy, productivity fell 3.7% in 2022-23, as output growth failed to keep pace with a record 6.9% increase in hours worked, the commission said. A rush by employers to hire new staff was much higher than in previous bursts \u2013 the nearest comparison was the 4.3% rise in hours worked in 1988-89. \u201cAustralians\u2019 incomes grew in 2022-23, mostly because they worked more hours,\u201d said the commission\u2019s deputy chair, Alex Robson. \u201cBut productivity growth is about working smarter, not working harder or longer.\u201d With labour market participation hovering near its record 67%, the economy has little scope to generate higher incomes by adding workers or time on the job, he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse, we know nominal wage growth without productivity growth can fuel inflation,\u201d Robson said. \u201cSustainable, long-term wage growth can only be realised by securing productivity gains.\u201d Employers, though, were also not doing their bit. The capital-to-labour ratio, one measure of spending on equipment to improve output, fell by a record 4.9% for the year. \u201cSo while a record number of Australians had jobs, employers didn\u2019t invest in the equipment, tools and resources that are needed to make the most of employees\u2019 skills and talents,\u201d Robson said. \u201cFurther capital investment would help turn our strong employment growth into strong productivity growth.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Reserve Bank has been one of the economic institutions to warn wage increases had to be accompanied by increased productivity to avoid adding to inflation pressures and delaying any interest rate cuts. In its latest statement on monetary policy, released at its first board meeting of 2024, the RBA listed productivity outcomes as among \u201cstill highly uncertain\u201d outcomes in its forecast for how fast inflation may fall back to its 2%-3% target range. \u201cOther things equal, poor productivity outcomes would underpin higher-than-expected costs for businesses and put upward pressure on the prices paid by consumers,\u201d it said. Wages rose 4.2% last year, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, or slightly faster than the 4.1% inflation rate. That was the first time in about two years that the wage price index had exceeded its consumer price equivalent. Still, economists have been wary about reading too much into recent poor productivity results. One issue has been the lingering effects of the Covid pandemic disruptions, with many people spending more time working from home. And, as the Productivity Commission itself notes, the decline in hourly output per worker was partly the result of some of the extra hours worked being taken up by \u201cless experienced or less productive labour\u201d. Many of those jobs were also in \u201crelatively low\u2011productivity sectors\u201d such as retailing and hospitality, the report said. With the unemployment rate now creeping up to 4.1% in January from a half-century low of 3.4% in October 2022, output per hour was also beginning to improve. \u201cThe decline in labour productivity appears to have halted in the first quarter of the 2023-24 financial year, although this is largely attributable to a fall in hours worked,\u201d the bulletin said. By industry, labour productivity grew most in the professional, scientific and technical services sector, with a 3% increase. The wholesale trade industry posted the largest fall, at 11.4%, as hours worked jumped 15.7%. All up, 11 out of the 16 market sector industries reported a decline."

            "date": "2024-02-29T18:50:32Z",
            "content": "A record 19 councils in England have been handed multimillion-pound government bailout agreements totalling \u00a32.5bn to prevent them collapsing into bankruptcy in the next few months, in a move likely to trigger a new round of public asset sales. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities has agreed that the councils can take the highly unusual step of using funds raised by loans, or the sale of assets such as land and buildings, to plug holes in day-to-day revenue accounts. The move, which follows an emergency \u00a3600m cash injection for all councils in January, is seen as a way of ministers minimising the prospect of further town hall insolvencies before the general election, rather than a solution to the wider crisis. Rob Whiteman, chief executive of Cipfa, the public sector accountancy body, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge relief to see 19 councils not going immediately bust. But it\u2019s a very temporary solution that stands normal accountancy practice on its head to get us to the other side of a general election. But that\u2019s all it does.\u201d The announcement comes after the latest dire predictions about English council finances. A survey report issued by the Local Government Information Unit on Wednesday estimated that 14 of England\u2019s 372 councils would go bust in the next 12 months, as they collectively struggle with an estimated \u00a34bn shortfall. The agreements, known as capitalisation directions, are not grants or bailouts in the conventional sense of a cash injection but an arrangement that allows councils to bypass normal accounting rules to convert capital sums obtained by loans or selling assets into revenue. Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the Local Government Information Unit, said the move was welcome but \u201cwe should not mistake this for generosity on the part of the government. They are simply allowing councils to borrow, and to sell their own assets.\u201d Birmingham council has already signalled that it intends to sell off up to \u00a3500m of as yet unidentified land, businesses and buildings from its \u00a32.4bn asset portfolio, which includes the city\u2019s central library, museum and art gallery, Aston Hall and the council\u2019s stake in Birmingham airport. Experts said capitalisation support is normally frowned upon as risky and short term, will not prevent cuts in council services, and is regarded as poor accounting practice. One told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s like you saying: \u2018I\u2019m selling my house to pay off my credit card bill.\u2019 I\u2019d say: \u2018Are you sure you really want to do that?\u2019\u201d Councils given exceptional financial support include Birmingham, Nottingham, Thurrock, Croydon, Slough, and Woking, all of which are in special measures after issuing formal section 114 declarations of bankruptcy in recent years. Other councils in the list include Havering in east London, which had said that failure to get financial support would trigger immediate bankruptcy; and Somerset, which declared a \u201cstate of financial emergency\u201d in autumn. Strikingly, both North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire councils, created as supposedly more sustainable successors to Northamptonshire county council, which went bust in 2018, have been allowed to capitalise \u00a310m between them to stave off effective bankruptcy. The other councils are: Bradford, Cheshire East, Cumberland, Eastbourne, Medway, Middlesbrough, Plymouth, Southampton, and Stoke-on-Trent. It is unclear if any councils had been refused financial support by ministers. Sir Stephen Houghton, chair of the Special Interest Group of Municipal Authorities, said: \u201cThis exceptional financial support will be welcome as a stopgap for those councils that have applied, but will not provide a long-term solution.\u201d A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: \u201cThis is about having a pragmatic approach and agreeing financial flexibilities with a small number of councils - as we have done in previous years \u2013 to help them balance their budgets and deliver vital services. \u201cNearly three quarters of the support announced this year relates to six councils where there has been severe local failure, forcing the government to step in and take action through statutory intervention. \u201cCouncils are ultimately responsible for their finances and will see their overall funding for the upcoming financial year increase to \u00a364.7 billion \u2013 a 7.5% increase in cash terms.\u201d"

            "content": "With government funding partially expiring on Friday, House and Senate negotiators have reached an agreement to prevent a shutdown. In a joint statement, congressional leaders of both parties confirmed that the House and the Senate would vote this week on a short-term funding bill to allow lawmakers more time to finalize full-year appropriations bills. The leaders said that negotiators have already reached a deal on six full-year spending bills, and the remaining six bills are expected to be finalized before 22 March. \u201cTo give the House and Senate appropriations committee adequate time to execute on this deal in principle, including drafting, preparing report language, scoring and other technical matters, and to allow members 72 hours to review, a short-term continuing resolution to fund agencies through March 8 and the 22 will be necessary, and voted on by the House and Senate this week,\u201d the leaders said. Funding previously would have expired at 12.01am on Saturday for roughly 20% of the federal government, and the remaining agencies only had enough money to last them through next Friday. If passed, the short-term funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, would mark the fourth such stopgap measure approved since September. Hard-right Republican lawmakers have voiced frustration with the short-term funding measures, but ongoing disagreements over some proposals in the appropriations bills have complicated talks over the full-year bills. After meeting with Joe Biden at the White House on Tuesday, the House speaker, the Republican Mike Johnson, expressed confidence that members could reach an agreement and avoid a shutdown. \u201cWe have been working in good faith around the clock every single day, for months and weeks and over the last several days, quite literally around the clock to get that job done. We\u2019re very optimistic,\u201d Johnson told reporters. \u201cWe believe that we can get to agreement on these issues and prevent a government shutdown. And that\u2019s our first responsibility.\u201d The Senate majority leader, the Democrat Chuck Schumer, echoed Johnson\u2019s assessment while acknowledging that another short-term funding bill would be necessary to prevent a lapse in federal funding. \u201cThe speaker said unequivocally he wants to avoid a government shutdown,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWe made it clear that that means not letting any of the government appropriations bills lapse, which means you need some CRs [continuing resolutions] to get that done. But we\u2019re making good progress, and we\u2019re hopeful we can get this done really quickly.\u201d A shutdown would have forced many federal employees to go without pay until Congress passed another funding bill, and while that disruption has been avoided for now, the threat will arise again in the coming weeks. If lawmakers can reach an agreement on all full-year appropriations bills before 22 March as promised, the government will be funded through the fiscal year, which ends on 30 September."

            "date": "2024-02-09T13:54:07Z",
            "content": "If most NBA trade deadlines storm in with a bang, Thursday\u2019s sort of limped through with a whimper. Only true NBA aficionados will have even heard of most of the names involved in transactions at the deadline this year, let alone have an opinion on the movement therein. But fear not, dear reader. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for. Here\u2019s a summary of the presumed winners and losers of the sleepiest trade deadline in recent memory. Winners New York Knicks Is that a pig I just saw coasting amongst the clouds? The Knicks are bona fide good, and not just on the court, but in the front office, too. This objective truth is something that would\u2019ve felt impossible as recently as four seasons ago, but that\u2019s where we are, and it wouldn\u2019t be outrageous to wonder if a championship is in the realm of possibility. That\u2019s due in large part to Jalen Brunson\u2019s ascension, and some of the supporting cast that entered the season with him at the Mecca. But the Knicks\u2019 midseason acquisitions were quite frankly impeccable, acquiring Perfect Knick\u2122 OG Anunoby (and Precious Achiuwa) from the Raptors pre-deadline and adding sharpshooter Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107 and worthwhile vet Alec Burks from Detroit at the buzzer. In a deadline without many clear \u201cwinners\u201d, the Knicks lead the pack. Milwaukee Bucks It\u2019s admittedly a stretch to call the Bucks, a team in what can only fairly be described as a bit of turmoil, as \u201cwinners\u201d at the deadline. They didn\u2019t add much to their defensively struggling roster, and have had an extremely underwhelming 1-5 record since swapping out rookie head coach Adrian Griffin for NBA household name head coach-cum-broadcaster Doc Rivers. But the firing is, by all accounts, one that needed to happen, so kudos to them for having the cajones to do it. And while they didn\u2019t take any big swings at the deadline (their hands were pretty tied, assets-wise), they did bring in veteran spark plug Patrick Beverley, a noted pest on point-of-attack defense, and, perhaps more importantly, a fiery incentivizer in the locker room \u2013 just what the doctor ordered for a Milwaukee team trudging through the doldrums of the season in hopes of a championship. Oklahoma City Thunder Sometimes less is more, and that was the case for the pleasant-surprise-of-the-season Thunder at the deadline. Sure, they probably would\u2019ve benefited from more depth at the center position \u2013 asking rookie Chet Holmgren, as sensational as he\u2019s been in his first real outing, to be counted on in his first ever playoffs may turn out to be too much. But this team is very much ahead of schedule, and excelling to a degree this season that no one expected, perhaps not even them. So it\u2019s fair to give the young core a chance to take a crack at the postseason and see what happens before making any major moves. But OKC did make a surprise move to snag veteran forward Gordon Hayward from the Charlotte Hornets. The 34-year-old Hayward, it should be noted, hasn\u2019t played an NBA game since late December and has been injury-prone most of his career. But he\u2019s still got enough left in the tank to be a meaningful playoff contributor, and the young Thunder desperately needed a solid veteran presence heading into what will be the first playoff experience for most of the team. Losers Chicago Bulls What the hell, exactly, are the Bulls doing? That\u2019s the question of the hour, and has been for a few seasons running. They\u2019re solidly a play-in team in a weak Eastern Conference, sure, but surely no better than that. There have been rumblings of trades regarding their best players for years on end, but instead of trading their stars while they still have any value, Chicago\u2019s powers that be have perplexingly opted to stand pat and, likely, allow the returns to become increasingly diminished. Pretty much any contender would\u2019ve likely overpaid for impressive overachieving role player Alex Caruso\u2019s services this year, but Chicago reportedly made him \u201cuntouchable\u201d. And Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan have been in perpetual trade rumors, but LaVine is now out for the season with yet another lower leg/foot injury and DeRozan will inch another year closer to retirement in Chicago purgatory. Detroit Pistons It\u2019s nothing short of remarkable that Troy Weaver is still gainfully employed. To call the Pistons a dumpster fire seems woefully understated; they\u2019ve set literal NBA records for ineptitude this year. But the worst part is that they weren\u2019t even intentionally tanking. The team went into this season having signed head coach Monty Williams to a nearly $80m deal, making him the highest paid coach in the league, and made proclamations of plans to be competitive, \u201creally good\u201d, even. They are pretty much the opposite of good, and instead of using the deadline to either really improve or shore up for the future, they kind of did neither \u2013 waiting too long on valuable assets like Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107 to get any meaningful return, not being particularly aggressive in trying to bring back alternative talent \u2013 and kept themselves right where they are. That is, a place no self-respecting team should be looking to stay. Los Angeles Lakers The Lakers\u2019 front office\u2019s decision to stand pat at the deadline was something of a Rashomon effect of decision-making: depending on whose prism you\u2019re viewing it through, it could be reasonably interpreted as a great idea, a horrible idea or something in between. There was a thin trade market, a noticeable gap between the Lakers and the top-tier contenders, and the team will have several more first-round picks to use to sweeten the pot if they hold out for a bigger swing this summer. But LeBron James also has more options this summer: a player option, to be exact. And he\u2019s made it quite clear of late that his preference was for the Lakers to be aggressive at the deadline. The Lakers brass\u2019 reluctance to push their chips into the center of the table and gamble on the upside of objectively remarkable outputs from him and co-captain Anthony Davis this year could cause him to opt for free agency, and that alone seems like it would\u2019ve been worth at least a move on the fringes to underscore their commitment."

Retail giant Sainsbury\u2019s told consumers there were problems that could affect the availability of black tea, although it is expected to be for a short period. A sign in one Sainsbury\u2019s store stated: \u201cWe are experiencing supply issues affecting the nationwide supply of black tea. We apologise for any inconvenience and hope to be back in full supply soon.\u201d But retail bosses have said the problems are temporary and stressed that the impact on consumers is expected to be minimal. Sainsbury\u2019s did not provide a comment. It is understood that the disruption is linked to Houthi attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, as well as supply and demand delays with one supermarket tea supplier. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: \u201cThere is temporary disruption to some black tea lines, but the impact on consumers will be minimal as retailers are not expecting significant challenges.\u201d Other supermarkets contacted by the Guardian did not report issues. Waitrose said it was not experiencing any shortages. China, India, Sri Lanka and Kenya produce about three-quarters of tea globally. Freight shipments from Asia and east Africa have faced significant disruption over the past two months due to attacks in the Red Sea. Violence by Houthi rebels in the region caused most shipping firms using the vital trade route, which heads towards the Suez canal, to redirect shipments around the Cape of Good Hope at the foot of Africa. This adds roughly 10 to 14 days on to shipment times, as well as increased costs for shipping firms. Sparsh Agarwal, owner of several tea gardens in Darjeeling in India and founder of Dorje Teas, told the i newspaper in December that tea shipments were being stalled due to the disruption. \u201cWe sent shipments to the US and Europe two weeks ago, but they are still in Mumbai port and have not been picked up yet,\u201d he said at the time. Joint strikes from the US and UK have been launched on the Yemen-based Houthis in recent weeks in a bid to stop the recent wave of attacks."

            "date": "2024-02-13T17:28:36Z",
            "content": "The multibillionaire Jeff Bezos and his fiancee, Lauren Sanchez, could save $600m in taxes simply because they moved to Florida. The accounting windfall stems from a $2bn sale of Amazon stock. Bezos, 59, who is in a three-way race with Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates and Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk for the title of wealthiest American, announced in November he was leaving Seattle after 30 years \u2013 ostensibly, he said in an Instagram post, to be nearer his parents and his Blue Origin rocket launches at Cape Canaveral. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in Seattle longer than I\u2019ve lived anywhere else and have so many amazing memories here. As exciting as the move is, it\u2019s an emotional decision for me. Seattle, you will always have a piece of my heart,\u201d he wrote. But on Tuesday the financial news network CNBC offered another clue to his move: two years ago, Washington introduced a new 7% capital gains tax on sales of stocks or bonds of more than $250,000. Florida, however, does not levy taxes on income or capital gains. Bezos, the outlet reported, has been selling billions of dollars of Amazon stock since 1998 to fund his philanthropic operations, Blue Origin, and some of his splashy acquisitions, including new homes on Miami\u2019s \u201cbillionaire bunker\u201d island Indian Creek and a $500m 417ft mega-yacht, the Koru. Last year, after the new tax, Bezos stopped selling Amazon stock \u2013 that is until he notified the US Securities and Exchange Commission that he plans to unload 50m shares before 31 January 2025 that at current values would amount to $8.7bn. On the first $2bn tranche last week, Bezos saved $140m in taxes he would have paid to Washington state, and on the entire sale over the next two years the figure would be about $610m or more, if Amazon stock continues to rise.

The cost of moving to Miami has been onerous in own right for the couple, who have so far splashed out $147m on two Indian Creek mansions, near the residences of the quarterback Tom Brady, Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, and the investor Carl Icahn. Miami real estate brokers say Bezos is likely to tear down the two homes and build a new one.

The architect Kobi Karp, who has worked in Miami \u201csince the Miami Vice and Scarface days\u201d, told Bloomberg that the island\u2019s biggest draw is privacy.

            "content": "In Hollywood everyone knows never to ask for a percentage of the film profits. These so-called \u201cmonkey points\u201d are the stuff of legends and mirth. Anyone silly enough to demand a slice of profits will be waiting by the letterbox for a cheque that will never come. Famously Forrest Gump never turned a profit, which is quite the achievement for a film that cost $55m to make and earned $678m worldwide. Given how we tax our gas industry, you get the feeling our gas companies love the way Hollywood does business, and the government has not worked out that they\u2019re the silly ones waiting for a cheque that will never arrive. Were we to tax gas appropriately we would have a much better chance to properly fund new policies such as those in the universities accord final report released on the weekend. Australia produces more than six times the amount of gas needed to supply our manufacturing industry, power stations and homes. But more than 80% either heads overseas as LNG exports or is used to convert natural gas into LNG: If the graph does not display click here We export a stonkingly large amount \u2013 and much more than we used to. In the 2000s we exported around 14m tonnes of LNG a year. Now, due to the opening of the Gladstone LNG terminal, we send 83mt overseas \u2013 the second most of any nation. More production equals more revenue thus surely more profit (even if the margins remain the same) and thus more tax \u2013 after all, why would companies massively increase production if not to make more money? Given we have a mining tax for the gas industry called the petroleum resources rent tax (PRRT), the government surely is swimming in a money bin of gas tax revenue. Alas no: If the graph does not display click here When Australia exported 15.4mt of LNG in 2008-09, the government raised $2.2bn in PRRT. In 2022-23, exports had increased 437% to 83mt but PRRT revenue was up just 7% to $2.4bn. It would appear that gas suddenly became unprofitable. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup At this point the corporate shills will scream that you don\u2019t get taxed on revenue or production but profits. That is both obvious and true but it was also obvious and true that before 2015, when the Gladstone terminal opened, there was a very strong correlation between gas industry revenue and gas industry taxes: If the graph does not display click here The same went for production and tax: If the graph does not display click here Were the companies stupid to start exporting LNG from Gladstone as it seems their profit margins have all but disappeared? If the graph does not display click here Had the relationship between revenue and tax paid stayed the same as in the decade before the Gladstone terminal opened, the gas industry would have paid $14bn more tax in 2020-21 and $58bn more in the seven years after 2014-15. The gas industry pays less tax per barrel of gas produced now than any time going back 35 years. Who would have thought producing so much gas would destroy their profits. If the graph does not display click here The problem is the PRRT is a tax lawyers\u2019 picnic \u2013 they can use costs to defray their liabilities for as long as they like. In 2021 the ATO told the Senate that Shell expected it would never pay PRRT on its 25% share of the $55bn Gorgon project. Never. Not one dollar. We tax our massive gas exports so weakly that, as the head of the Australia Institute, (whom I work for), Richard Denniss, noted to the National Press Club, Australians pay more each year in Hecs/Help debt than gas companies do in PRRT: If the graph does not display click here In last year\u2019s budget, the government finally proposed limiting the deductions to the PRRT in any year to 90% of LNG project revenues. Alas that proposal also had a punchline. The government announced the changes would raise an extra $2.4bn in PRRT over the next four years. That was roughly a 30% increase in tax. Thirty per cent! You would think the gas industry would launch the mother of all campaigns against it. But no. They loved it. The day it was announced the gas industry peak body recommended bipartisan support as the changes \u201cwould see more revenue collected earlier\u201d. The key word was \u201cearlier\u201d. It won\u2019t raise more tax; it just moves some tax from later to earlier. But it won\u2019t even do that. In December\u2019s midyear economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo), the government announced it was revising down its estimate of how much PRRT would be raised over the next four years. How much did it reduce its estimate by? You guessed it: $2.4bn: If the graph does not display click here That\u2019s despite the Treasury also estimating higher gas prices. No wonder the gas companies love the changes. We have rising levels of student debt, declining public school infrastructure and facilities and a desperate need for better tertiary education all the while apparently being the second biggest exporter of gas in the world. For too long governments have been content to be monkeys playing the fool for the gas companies. That needs to change. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

            "date": "2024-02-01T19:09:41Z",
            "content": "Europe\u2019s farming sector is facing a big crisis and must \u201cprofoundly\u201d change its rules, Emmanuel Macron has said after a European Union leaders\u2019 summit in Brussels was overshadowed by protesting farmers hurling eggs, dumping manure and lighting fires. Speaking as hundreds of farmers from Belgium, the Netherlands and elsewhere blocked streets around the European parliament with tractors, the French president said there should be a joint EU mechanism to guarantee fair prices paid to farmers by food giants and supermarkets. He said regulations should be simplified, after weeks of farmer protests across Europe have blockaded motorways. Although agriculture had not been on the agenda of the leaders\u2019 summit, the proximity and intensity of the spreading farmers\u2019 protests made it impossible for politicians in Brussels to ignore. Praising farmers\u2019 \u201cremarkable resilience\u201d, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said she was working closely with EU member states \u201cto address the immediate challenges\u201d. \u201cTo the farmers that are outside. We see you and we hear you,\u201d said Roberta Metsola, the European parliament president. After weeks in which farmers from Germany, France, Belgium, Italy and Greece protested, hundreds descended on Brussels on Thursday to put more pressure on European leaders to do more to help them with taxes, rising costs and environmental rules. Main roads in the city were blocked by about 1,300 tractors and agricultural trucks emblazoned with slogans such as \u201cNo farmers, no food\u201d. Palls of black smoke from a pyre of rubber tyres filled the air and at one point police were forced to hose down burning straw and manure that had been unceremoniously dumped in front of the parliament building. \u201cIf you see how many people we are here today, and if you see it\u2019s all over Europe, you must have hope,\u201d Kevin Bertens, a Belgian farmer, told Reuters. \u201cYou need us. Help us.\u201d Pierre Sansdrap, a Belgian dairy farmer, told AFP that it was \u201csymbolically important\u201d to protest in Brussels. \u201cTo change things, you have to come here,\u201d he said. Farmers union representatives said they were \u201cfed up in general\u201d with \u201ctoo much administration\u201d and rules telling them how they should farm. Olivier Devalckeneer, from the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Wallonne d\u2019Agriculture, said: \u201cWe want a change; we want farming to be protected, not undermined.\u201d Farmers in different European countries have said they are not being paid enough for their produce, are struggling with taxes and green rules and face unfair competition from abroad. On Thursday, after the French prime minister, Gabriel Attal, announced a package of \u20ac150m (\u00a3128m) in aid for French farmers in need, two major farmers\u2019 unions, the FNSEA and Jeunes Agriculteurs, said they would tell their members to suspend protests and lift road blockades across the country. Attal\u2019s pledge followed several other government announcements made in recent weeks to help assuage farmers\u2019 anger. In total the measures are worth \u20ac400m. Arnaud Rousseau, chief of the biggest rural union FNSEA, on Thursday hailed \u201creal progress\u201d and said Attal was \u201clistening \u2026 to try and understand what\u2019s at stake for us\u201d. But the union chief said new protests could be held if \u201cinitial results\u201d from the promises were not seen by the time France\u2019s main agriculture trade fair opened at the end of this month. One of the biggest concerns of farmers across the EU is a free-trade agreement with Latin American countries that has been in the making for about two decades but which is now coming under renewed pressure from European farmers, and, consequently, leaders. Farmers fear the Mercosur deal will lead to the European agricultural sector facing a new level of unfair competition. \u201cWe want the EU to be aware of our situation. There are too many regulations, the salaries are not high enough and now we are facing imports because of the Mercosur deal where farmers don\u2019t even have to have the same standards as us,\u201d said Emile Herbiet, a Belgian blue cattle-breeder who had come to Brussels to protest on Thursday. Speaking after the summit, Macron said he was against signing the Mercosur deal, not because he objected to it in principle but because it was outdated in its current form. He said: \u201cAll we are asking for is that the environmental and hygiene rules we impose on our farmers and other professions be the same. As of today, as the draft texts stand, France opposes and will continue to oppose this free-trade deal.\u201d Earlier, the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, had also said the deal should not go ahead in its current form. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, however, threw his weight behind the agreement, declaring himself a \u201cbig fan\u201d. Von der Leyen insisted farmers could continue to count on the EU, which devotes about a third of its budget to agriculture through the common agricultural policy (CAP). \u201cIn 2023 alone, Europe provided exceptional assistance of over \u20ac500m to farmers most affected by crisis. We know that this support is crucial. And we know that farmers are making good use of it. But in parallel, the commission is now working closely with the member states to address the immediate challenges,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2024-02-26T06:00:18Z",
            "content": "The head of Britain\u2019s trade union movement and the boss of a leading retailer have joined forces to demand the government takes tougher action to catch wealthy tax dodgers. Paul Nowak, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), and Julian Richer, founder of the Richer Sounds hi-fi chain, said the public were losing out on up to \u00a336bn a year in taxes owed by companies and individuals that were not being collected. In a joint intervention before next week\u2019s budget \u2013 when the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is expected to prioritise pre-election tax giveaways \u2013 they warned HM Revenue and Customs lacked the necessary funding to chase down businesses and the super-rich for non-payment, avoidance and evasion. They called on Hunt to boost HMRC\u2019s funding so it can drastically increase the number of investigations and enforcement cases it can handle in order to close the tax gap, warning as much as \u00a320bn was being lost to \u201cserious transgressions\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a national scandal,\u201d Richer told the Guardian, in a joint interview with Nowak at the TUC\u2019s Congress House headquarters in central London. \u201cWhat really annoys us are these guys ripping off the state. So for me it\u2019s personal. I\u2019m absolutely outraged by what\u2019s going on. \u201cWe chase people on benefits who don\u2019t pay \u2013 we found money for that. And yet, we\u2019re not spending it on this? It\u2019s absolutely wrong and the great majority of the public are being cheated by this lack of effort.\u201d Throwing the weight of the union movement behind calls to boost HMRC\u2019s resources to chase businesses and wealthy individuals for unpaid taxes, Nowak said: \u201cThis is a no-brainer. From a fairness point of view, to support our public services, and to make sure people pay their fair share. \u201cOur members pay their taxes. For them, taxes aren\u2019t optional. HMRC doesn\u2019t show discretion. But here we\u2019ve got tens of billions of pounds that should be going to fund our schools and hospitals that are being wasted.\u201d The union leader and multimillionaire business owner pointed to figures estimating that HMRC\u2019s tax gap \u2013 the difference between what it expects to receive and its actual receipts \u2013 increased to \u00a336bn last year. While some of that number relates to common mistakes or carelessness, analysis by the TaxWatch thinktank, which is bankrolled by Richer, shows \u00a320bn comes from more serious transgressions such as criminal attacks, evasion, legal interpretations arguing for non-payment, hiding of economic activity and avoidance. The independent watchdog, which Richer helped to launch after growing angry with Britain\u2019s \u201cbroken\u201d tax system, said compliance checks by HMRC were down 20% from pre-pandemic levels amid a lack of funding to carry out checks and depleted morale among staff. It follows a report earlier this month based on data from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism that found the number of investigations by an HMRC fraud unit into offshore, corporate and wealthy taxpayers had fallen by more than half in five years. Nowak said that funding for HMRC had in effect flatlined despite a surge in its caseload to investigate Covid fraud, leading to burnout and inefficiency because staff were overworked and underpaid. \u201cDealing with some of the abuses around what\u2019s been happening with the Covid recovery funds meant they took their eyes off what was happening with tax more broadly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a government that currently isn\u2019t really interested in enforcing its own rules, particularly for those who might be donating to its own election campaign.\u201d The TUC and TaxWatch said there was a strong case for funding HMRC because estimates showed that every \u00a31 spent on compliance generated \u00a315 back for the public purse, with the returns rising to as much as \u00a339 for investigations into large companies. Nowak said the lack of funding was emblematic of a wider shortsighted approach under the Conservatives to the public sector, arguing that a lack of money for schools, the health service, police and other services was undermining the economy. Amid speculation that the chancellor could prioritise tax cuts over funding for public services, Richer warned that business leaders would prefer a country with a functioning state. \u201cWe\u2019ve got so many things broken in our country, we need to spend more money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe NHS is crumbling, dental services are crumbling, the roads are not being repaired, the criminal justice system is falling apart at the seams. Is this a time to cut taxes, really? \u201cIt\u2019s just a bribe from a political party trying to get votes.\u201d HMRC was approached for comment."

            "date": "2024-02-12T17:00:02Z",
            "content": "Cultural commentators, numerous TikTok users and my single friends all agree: dating culture is a dumpster fire. If you\u2019re not being ghosted, being served your sibling\u2019s dating profile or being swindled out of your savings, your designer shoes are getting stolen. However, we\u2019ve never had more access to hot singles in our area. Your future spouse could be just a swipe away during your next bathroom visit. This hope keeps us sifting through a sea of frogs who type \u201cahaha\u201d after every message. It\u2019s a numbers game that\u2019s about as romantic as doing your taxes. In addition to household names like Tinder and Hinge, there are now dating apps for nearly any dynamic or niche: Loosid for sober people, Feeld for kink-based or alternative relationship dynamics, Lumen for those over 50 seeking same. In my experience, the apps usually deliver what they promise: humans to go on a date with. Some dates were fun, and only a few were alarmingly inappropriate \u2013 but nearly every one led to a handful of dates at most. This last bit has many users at their wits\u2019 end. \u201cIt just seems like nobody wants anything,\u201d a single friend told me, frustrated. More apps don\u2019t necessarily mean better experiences. But if you\u2019re in app rotation hell, a reframe could nudge you closer to the relationship you want \u2013 or at least make dating feel more beneficial, no matter the outcome. Here are some suggestions. Treat dating as an opportunity for growth, rather than a means to an end We\u2019ve developed a novel vocabulary to describe all the ways that dating has become gamelike (ghosting, breadcrumbing, situationships), but accepting that dating has evolved makes it easier to shift our expectations and approach. We don\u2019t have to settle for rude or disrespectful behavior, but we also don\u2019t have to take it personally. \u201cIt\u2019s important to approach dating as an opportunity for personal growth,\u201d the therapist Sophia Cress tells me. \u201cInstead of seeing setbacks as failures, they can be viewed as chances to discover more about oneself, cultivating resilience and a positive outlook.\u201d The paradox of choice can have paralyzing effects. \u201cThe sheer volume of potential matches on dating apps can be overwhelming, leading some to adopt a disposable mindset where connections are easily discarded in pursuit of the elusive \u2018perfect\u2019 match,\u201d says Cress. \u201cThis approach undermines the value of investing time and effort into getting to know someone, hindering the development of genuine connections.\u201d Learning to manage expectations can help when navigating unexpected or disappointing outcomes. Dating can feel like an emotionally risky business, as can developing genuine feelings and daring to act on them. But going with it can produce unpredictable benefits or shiny nuggets of wisdom to take with you into the future. Don\u2019t think about dating as a waste of time For obvious reasons, it\u2019s easy to believe dating is \u201csuccessful\u201d only if the outcome is happily ever after. But no one and no date is a waste of time just because meeting them didn\u2019t yield the desired results. Everyone has expectations, spoken or unspoken, but it\u2019s not necessarily your date\u2019s responsibility to meet them (aside from basic manners and kindness). \u201cPeople are more scared of failure than excited by the adventure of dating, understandably,\u201d Ayla, 30, from Brooklyn tells me. \u201cBut what if, even if it didn\u2019t work out, that date was really lovely and you got to learn some new things, you laughed, or you tried a new restaurant?\u201d Just enjoy flirting Flirting can include the frisson with that person you grab drinks with sporadically, the will-they-won\u2019t-they dynamic you have with your local barista, good chat with app matches, an exchange with that friend of a friend who may or may not be interested. This can show that you have more prospects than you think. Flirting can be fun without necessarily getting romantic, as it builds that exciting anything could happen energy. Cress says flirting \u201cshould be viewed as a natural expression of interest and playfulness\u201d rather than a set of predefined actions or performances. So how do you do it? \u201cEmbracing a positive and self-assured energy can be attractive,\u201d she says. \u201cEngaging in active listening and responding genuinely to the other person\u2019s cues fosters a reciprocal exchange of energy, creating a connection that goes beyond surface-level interactions.\u201d Use dates and relationships as opportunities for self-reflection Getting emotionally entangled with new people can unearth dormant triggers and tender bits. Such vulnerable work is valuable for your own wellbeing and evolution as well as future relationships. \u201cThe more people I meet and date, the more I know who I am and what\u2019s important to me,\u201d Peter, 36, from Oakland, tells me. \u201cI set boundaries for both them and myself, and when they cross them I check in with myself \u2013 and then I ask why I\u2019m letting someone treat me in a way that we both know is not acceptable.\u201d \u201cCasual dating can also broaden one\u2019s worldview and enhance empathy by exposing [you] to different perspectives and lifestyles,\u201d Cress explains. Daters \u201cmay discover their tolerance for ambiguity, preferences in communication frequency, or comfort levels with vulnerability. These insights can contribute to increased self-confidence and a better understanding of one\u2019s needs and desires in a romantic partnership.\u201d Most dates do not work out for everyone involved \u2013 if you aren\u2019t turning someone down or calling it quits, they\u2019re potentially doing it to you. Learning to take an L like a champ is a useful (and attractive) skill. \u201cExperiencing a range of dating outcomes, both positive and negative, can help individuals develop emotional resilience,\u201d Cress says. \u201cIt equips them to handle the challenges of modern dating with poise and self-confidence. As a result, they become better able to navigate the ups and downs of the dating scene, which can lead to healthier future relationships.\u201d Delete your apps If you\u2019re truly unhappy dating on the apps, delete them. \u201cBeing continuously exposed to the unpredictable nature of dating apps can take a toll on one\u2019s emotions, so taking a step back to focus on self-care is essential,\u201d says Cress. \u201cIf the continuous use of dating apps becomes more of a burden than a pleasant experience, it might be an indication that it\u2019s time to take a break or delete.\u201d In my experience, there\u2019s a sweet spot to how long being on an app is fruitful \u2013 typically a season. The longer you linger, the returns diminish. You\u2019ve probably matched with everyone you\u2019re going to match with. Conversations have either led to dates or gone cold. Then fatigue sets in. Each person devolves into a Pok\u00e9mon card, and swiping becomes tedious. Get rid of the apps and shift your efforts to other parts of your life or meeting people in other ways. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean giving up on finding a partner, but rather prioritizing emotional resilience and wellbeing,\u201d Cress says. She encourages pursuing activities that bring joy and fulfillment outside of romantic relationships as a way to contribute to overall happiness. Get a hobby Make it something you\u2019ve always wanted to do; for bonus social interaction, choose a communal activity. Sarah, 28, from San Diego did just that. \u201cI found my mom\u2019s old film camera and brought it in to get cleaned. The person working at the camera shop told me about a group in the city that gets together every Sunday morning and walks around San Diego taking film pictures,\u201d she says. \u201cI went and immediately met many nice people \u2013 one was a cute guy who took a portrait of me. He DMed me the pictures, and we kept talking. It\u2019s been a few months now and we\u2019re dating.\u201d Talk to strangers more If you live in a big city, this may feel like an obscene suggestion. But spontaneous conversations can be brief and effective. They can make you feel happier. Maybe you\u2019ll make a new friend; maybe you\u2019ll make a date. Having a friendly exchange with someone who orders an interesting dish at a restaurant, has a fabulous coat or also saw that bird steal a french fry from your meal can expand your social circle. And if nothing else, you\u2019re dusting up on your social skills for those dates you\u2019ll eventually go on with strangers \u2013 who may or may not be from an app."

            "content": "Microsoft-backed OpenAI has completed a deal that values the artificial intelligence company at $80bn or more, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing multiple people with knowledge of the deal. The company would sell existing shares in a so-called tender offer led by venture firm Thrive Capital, the report said. Employees will be able to cash out their shares of the company rather than a traditional funding round, which would raise money for the business, the report added. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The artificial intelligence firm agreed to a similar deal early last year. The venture-capital firms Thrive Capital, Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and K2 Global agreed to buy OpenAI shares in a tender offer, valuing the company at around $29bn, the report said. OpenAI has attracted a number of major funding rounds, including Microsoft\u2019s investment of $10bn in January 2023. The company also funded OpenAI in 2019 and 2021. The launch of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in late 2022 has kicked off buzz around AI, prompting companies to explore ways to harness the power of the technology. AI has been integrated into a number of products, including Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine as it continues to push forward with its own developments. On Thursday, OpenAI announced the launch of Sora, a tool that can generate videos from text prompts. The day before, it announced it was experimenting with adding deeper memory to ChatGPT so the tool can remember more of its users\u2019 chats. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has also been reportedly in talks to acquire a chip builder or otherwise boost the company\u2019s access to the expensive artificial intelligence chips its tools rely on. The latest deal is the biggest backing of the company after a brief period of turmoil in late 2023, in which Altman was fired by the company\u2019s board before being rehired following employee outrage. The large investments in OpenAI have attracted the attention of regulators, with European Commission officials stating in early January that they would look into whether Microsoft\u2019s backing raises antitrust concerns. On 24 January, the Federal Trade Commission in the US said it was investigating whether investments from Microsoft, Google and Amazon into AI companies including OpenAI harm competition."

            "content": "Having invested in the original Bonn production of Jonathan Dove\u2019s rumbustious Victorian political farce in 2018, it was bold of Scottish Opera to elect to create an entirely new staging for the work\u2019s UK premiere. But taking control of the means of production \u2013 and handing them to Australian director Stephen Barlow, who staged the same composer\u2019s latest opera, Itch, at Holland Park last summer \u2013 looks to have been a wise move. Packed full of vivid stage pictures, Marx in London! is set on a single day \u2013 14 August 1871 \u2013 like Ulysses, Mrs Dalloway or Mozart\u2019s The Marriage of Figaro, and uses known events from the political philosopher\u2019s chaotic home life while he was working on Das Kapital at the British Museum. The kinetic designs, by Yannis Thavoris, with video by PJ McEvoy, recreate that institution as well as the Marx family home and a picaresque travelogue though Victorian London. Triumphant in the title role of Karl Marx is baritone Roland Wood, and, alongside many other company stalwarts, soprano Orla Boylan is magnificent as his long-suffering wife, Jenny, in her Scottish Opera debut. Rebecca Bottone handles the contemporary coloratura role of daughter Tussi with aplomb, and Lucy Schaufer delivers the low mezzo music of housekeeper (and keeper of secrets), Helene, with equal assurance. Much of the orchestral score brings to mind John Adams, but there are also recurring spare syncopated themes, and big, lusher sections that fall less obviously into that post-minimalist bag. Across it all, conductor David Parry and the Orchestra of Scottish Opera are in immaculate form in the pit, precision details in the percussion, sparkling wind and brass and terrific ensemble in the strings. Charles Hart\u2019s witty libretto, full of clever internal rhymes and more than a few genuinely laugh-out-loud moments, allows the complex scenario of the opera to emerge with remarkable clarity. But it is the set pieces that really stand out amid all the meta-theatrical japes. The first act concludes with a workers\u2019 chorus that introduces modern figures from political activism, Wood\u2019s soapbox oratory in the Red Lion pub in act two dispenses entirely with the jokes and irony to set Marxist theory to music, and Boylan and Schaufer have a superb drinking song duet that is surely destined to become a popular party piece. \u2022 At Theatre Royal Glasgow on 15 and 17 February and Festival theatre, Edinburgh, 22 and 24 February 2024."

            "content": "People living in Notting Hill, west London, received more in capital gains from 2015 to 2019 than the combined population of Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle according to an analysis of capital gains tax. Analysis of anonymised personal tax returns found that 97% of the population never receive any capital gain, and those that do are very likely to be among the very richest who benefit from the tax rate being lower than that earned on income from a salary. In fact, half of gains for \u201cthe entire country go to as many people as could fit in the Albert Hall\u201d, researchers said. A capital gain is the money received from selling an investment for more than the purchase price. The tax rate on capital gains varies between 10% and 28% depending on the taxpayer\u2019s income level and the type of asset sold. But the tax paid is always lower than income tax rates for the same person, with reliefs in place that allow up to \u00a310m to be received at a 10% tax rate even for the highest rate taxpayers. Just 0.3% of people with income under \u00a350,000 had taxable gains in an average year, compared with almost 40% of taxpayers with incomes over \u00a35m receiving some gains. Analysis of tax returns by researchers from the University of Warwick and the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) found that 25% of all the gains go to people living in London. A further 22.4% are received by people living in the south-east of the country. By contrast, taxpayers in Wales, the north east and Northern Ireland received just 2%, 1.5% and 1.3% of capital gains, respectively. Within London, the gains are heavily concentrated among the richest areas. Five London constituencies \u2013 Kensington, the cities of London and Westminster, Chelsea and Fulham, Hampstead and Kilburn, and Richmond Park \u2013 each had more capital gains than both the north east and Northern Ireland. Andrew Lonsdale, research officer at LSE\u2019s International Inequalities Institute (III), said: \u201cThere are more capital gains in Kensington than the whole of Wales, and more in Hampstead and Kilburn than the north east of England. Continuing to tax these gains at a lower rate than earnings from work is the complete opposite of \u2018levelling up\u2019.\u201d Within Kensington, people living in a small collection of streets in Notting Hill that are home to just 6,400 people \u201chad as much in capital gains in 2015-2019 as Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle combined, highlighting the extent of hyper-local concentration within the capital\u201d. Ranking people by gains received, the top 50,000 gainers \u2013 who make up about 0.1% of UK adults \u2013 received 86.4% of gains, worth about \u00a356bn in total. Each person received at least \u00a3143,000. Arun Advani, associate professor at the University of Warwick\u2019s Economics Department and CAGE Research Centre, said: \u201cCapital gains are absurdly concentrated, with half the gains in the entire country going to as many people as could fit in the Albert Hall. Less than one in 30 people have any gains at all over the course of a decade.\u201d In the last Labour manifesto, the party proposed aligning capital gains rates with income tax rates. However, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said in March 2023 that the party had no plans to increase capital gains tax. \u201cThere are people who have built up their own businesses who maybe at retirement want to sell that business,\u201d she said. \u201cThey may not have had huge income through their life if they\u2019ve re-invested in their business, but this is their retirement pot of money. And we also have said we want Britain to be the best place to start and grow a business.\u201d Capital gains tax rules allowed the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, to pay an effective UK tax rate of 23% on \u00a32.2m income last year. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, paid \u00a352,688 in capital gains tax on income of \u00a3275,739 from the sale of a field in December 2022."

            "content": "The villagers of Muirkirk, a former mining community known for its religious revolutionaries and its footballers, have plans for the derelict petrol station they are about to buy for a knockdown price. An acre square of crumbling tarmac and scrub, it will soon become a community garden and a picnic stop for tourists travelling through Ayrshire on the A70, thanks to an unusual deal with one of Scotland\u2019s oldest state institutions: the King\u2019s and Lord Treasurer\u2019s Remembrancer (KLTR). Muirkirk\u2019s old filling station is a case study for a major new initiative by the KLTR to give away, for a minimal fee, dozens of buildings, pieces of land, factories and offices across Scotland that have become ownerless and unused. Founded as the Scottish court of exchequer in 1707, the agency would ordinarily try to sell these properties at the market rate, passing on revenues to the Scottish government\u2019s consolidated fund under a long-established system known as bona vacantia, where ownerless properties were transferred previously to the monarch and more recently to the state. Under the KLTR\u2019s new ownerless property transfer scheme, due to formally start on 1 March, local communities will be offered buildings or land worth up to \u00a3500,000, potentially shifting millions of pounds worth of property into community ownership. It has already given away a small uninhabited island near Eday in Orkney, used by seals as a haul-out, and is negotiating the community transfers of a derelict Grade A-listed art nouveau office block in Glasgow called the Lion Chambers, which is one of the first in the UK to use reinforced concrete; an old hotel in Falkirk; and vacant land beside some Glasgow tenements which has a market value of \u00a3300,000 and will be converted into a market garden. This policy, endorsed by Scottish ministers, highlights the growing contrast over land ownership policy with the rest of the UK. England\u2019s bona vacantia policies which, unlike in Scotland, include the assets of people who died intestate, remain rooted in their feudal past. In most of England and Wales those revenues go direct to the Treasury, but the royal family\u2019s duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster have the legal right to all bona vacantia assets in their areas. The Duchy of Lancaster decided to donate \u00a3100m to ethical funds last year after a Guardian investigation found it used bona vacantia revenues to finance its property empire. David McLatchie, a director of Muirkirk Enterprise Group (MEG), a social enterprise linked to the village\u2019s community council, said the filling station project was a helpful part of Muirkirk\u2019s regeneration. The closure of its coalmines and ironworks plunged Muirkirk into significant poverty, but over the last 25 years MEG has worked to reinvigorate the area by opening heritage parks, community plantations, a bird hide, a skate park, and by refurbishing buildings for small businesses. The village, which was the first in the UK to install gas lighting, has a revolutionary history: Muirkirk was a centre of the 17th-century revolt by the Covenanters, lowland Protestants who rejected the king\u2019s attempts to control their religion, initially aligning themselves with Oliver Cromwell\u2019s parliamentarian army. It was also the birthplace of a host of professional footballers, with the Liverpool manager Bill Shankly born in nearby Glenbuck, and is home to two 18th-century poets associated with Robert Burns: John Lapraik and Isabel Pagan. McLatchie said the derelict filling station was an eyesore, and that replacing it with a garden would improve villagers\u2019 mental wellbeing. \u201cThis is going to enhance the village in terms of the attractiveness of the village \u2026 it\u2019s not the last piece in the jigsaw, but it\u2019s part of it.\u201d The KLTR\u2019s new strategy, which was proposed by the Scottish Land Commission, which advises ministers on expanding community buyouts, is akin to the asset transfers that local councils and Forestry and Land Scotland are overseeing under a ministerial mandate to expand community ownership. Bobby Sandeman, the KLTR\u2019s head of department, said transfers had to demonstrate clear public interest and community benefits, and prove they had strong local support and a comprehensive business case. Its decisions are overseen by a panel of expert advisers. Sandeman said the goal was to support community creativity and wealth-sharing. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about money, it\u2019s also thinking about how to realise social and community capital; that\u2019s the genesis of this,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 February 2024.

            "content": "Forget Paris in spring: Rome is both warmer and cooler in the first few months of the year. The locals are in their winter black rollneck jumpers, accessorised with equally noir-ish sunglasses. With an average of 17C by March, it\u2019s warm enough to sit outside caf\u00e9s and bars, but not hot enough to fall foul of the \u201cno shorts\u201d rule enforced in Rome\u2019s oldest churches. Inside Villa Farnesina (\u20ac12; villafarnesina.it), there is just a handful of people admiring the murals by Raphael, while outside a grove of citrus trees is groaning with fruit. The Caff\u00e8 Settimiano on nearby Via Garibaldi \u2013 where I stop off for my first Aperol spritz of the year \u2013 is full of mismatched vintage furniture, attracting equal numbers of Romans and blissed-out American students beginning a semester abroad. Like other European cities, Rome now has a selection of hotels which aim to offer maximum experience at lower costs. At the newly opened CitizenM Rome Isola Tiberina, there\u2019s no room service, nor are there minibars in the rooms. Instead, CitizenM has a pullout refrigerator drawer and will point you towards the nearest supermarket (there are drinks and food to buy in the lobby). In other ways, serious money has been spent to ensure staying here feels like a treat rather than a trade down. The hotel group likes designer furniture (the real stuff supplied by Vitra, rather than cheaper copies). It\u2019s in a central part of the city, rather than the suburbs. Crucially, the beds are big and the bedding has experientially high-thread counts. At these new style hotels, prices rise and fall with demand. The industry term is \u201cdynamic\u201d \u2013 you\u2019ll get the best rates in low season or by booking far ahead, or when they\u2019ve recently opened. CitizenM started in the Netherlands and there\u2019s a tangible egalitarian Dutch ethos at play at breakfast: we\u2019re encouraged to pick up our coffees from the counter and take our trays to a trolley in the corner after we\u2019ve finished which fits with the \u201cleave as you found it\u201d feel of the place. My first stop is near the hotel, Pasticceria Boccione on Piazza Costaguti, which is the oldest Jewish bakery in Rome, founded in 1815. There may not be a sign outside, but there\u2019s always a queue for its pizza ebraica, a charred-looking, phenomenally delicious pastry, with candied fruits, almonds and raisins held together with dough. Afterwards, I wander, nip into churches, window shop for cassocks and vestments (Rome has many shops selling religious clothing) and stop off at Beppe e i Suoi Formaggi, a cheesemonger that also serves natural wine, on Via di Santa Maria del Pianto. Visiting before the crowds in summer means that the queues for the Pantheon are short but, in fact, most of Rome\u2019s joys \u2013 churches apart \u2013 aren\u2019t behind walls. The city is studded with ancient remains, lovely in the late afternoon sun, but even more beautiful at twilight, when there are few tourists around. A five-minute walk away from the hotel, I come across the Portico d\u2019Ottavia, built by Emperor Augustus circa 20BC, now with walkways where you can just wander between columns and ancient arches, while surrounded by houses and apartments. The CitizenM also has a roof terrace on the fifth floor, with stylish lounge chairs but no restaurant \u2013 instead it\u2019s for guests to use as they want to. I buy pizza from the very excellent Florida (\u20ac3 a slice) on Via Florida and take it to the roof terrace. Yes, as night falls, there\u2019s a bit of a nip in the air, but with the hum of city noise, there\u2019s also the warm knowledge that Rome feels like the ultimate sweet spot for a spring city break.

            "date": "2024-02-10T14:35:18Z",
            "content": "Entrepreneurs are a false god. We offer them billions of pounds\u2019 worth of tax breaks and subsidies, and a lot of goodwill, when research suggests that most, after pocketing the cash, will do little to help UK plc prosper. Academic studies have found that small business owners, while being a significant slice of the economy and a source of employment, are very rarely the spur for innovation or increases in productivity, let alone the wellbeing of the workers under their employ (health and safety is worse in small businesses). If you want innovation and creativity, big companies with expertise to spare are a better bet \u2013 or the kind of startups that thrive, like arm\u2019s-length subsidiaries, shielded by the umbrella of a university or private equity firm. These are companies worthy of targeted state support. On the other hand, the idea of the entrepreneur as wealth generator par excellence is at best unproven and at worst entirely misplaced. It is important to pay attention to the academic literature, because entrepreneurship underpins the neoliberal narrative that has dominated politics for the past 40 years and still forms the bedrock of mainstream economic thought. Without any supporting empirical evidence, this belief has meant almost every entrepreneur getting a handout in the desperate hope that they might build a Microsoft or Amazon. At the start of 2023 there were 1.4m small businesses (those with 1 to 49 employees) and 36,900 medium-sized businesses in the UK (those with 50 to 249 employees). Last month, the National Audit Office (NAO) identified 39 reliefs aimed at increasing business investment. The bill for 29 \u2013 most of them aimed at small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) \u2013 was estimated at \u00a316.6bn. What bang did the government get for its buck? The NAO said: \u201cThe Treasury and HMRC do not monitor or evaluate reliefs closely enough to understand if they cost too much or achieve their intended economic impacts.\u201d Entrepreneurs\u2019 relief costs about \u00a33bn a year, and aims to encourage people to start or join growing companies, by lowering the rate of capital gains tax they pay when selling the company. A review in 2019 by Adam Corlett at the Resolution Foundation came to a similar conclusion as the NAO: it is possible to see that 52,000 people claimed the relief in 2015-16, with an average gain of \u00a375,000 per person, but not whether their businesses were hi-tech startups or restaurant chains. Other tax reliefs for business are available, enterprise zones among them, where there is almost no understanding of the benefit of such colossally expensive state gifts. Paul Nightingale, a professor of strategy at Sussex University, says the UK is not alone. Most governments have failed to provide a rigorous analysis of the impact that SMEs have on economic productivity and growth. Nightingale wrote a paper with Alex Coad, a professor at the Waseda Business School in Tokyo, that divided SMEs into \u201cgazelles\u201d and \u201cmuppets\u201d (marginal undersized poor performance enterprises). \u201cMuppets\u201d might seem harsh, but the former Bank of England economist, Andy Haldane, a member of the Treasury\u2019s economic advisory council, was even less flattering when he called them \u201czombies\u201d. \u201cDespite an almost universally accepted belief outside academia that entrepreneurial activity is a positive driving force in the economy, the accumulated evidence remains largely inconclusive,\u201d the academics say. \u201cA small proportion of high-performing firms drive the majority of innovation, wealth creation and new job generation, while most firms, including the median small business and the median startup, have only a marginal impact.\u201d The economist most closely tied with the narrative that small firms can be creative, innovative and disruptive is Joseph Schumpeter, while the free-market evangelist Friedrich Hayek was credited by Ronald Reagan\u2019s advisers and Margaret Thatcher as a touchstone. Coad says their positions are almost religious, in that they are faith-based rather than relying on evidence. Mariana Mazzucato, an economics professor at University College London, attacks the issue from a different angle. Her book on industrial policy, Public Purpose, shows most \u201cgazelles\u201d are fostered by the state \u2013 and not through indiscriminate subsidies, but consistent and persistent support from state agencies. Rather than weighing down a dynamic private sector, public investments have been behind many of the greatest innovations of our time, she argues. Yet politicians are hard-wired to believe profound creativity only happens in the garden shed of a genius entrepreneur. Now we must put up with Alan Sugar, star of the The Apprentice \u2013 the 18th series of which is now showing on BBC One \u2013 showcasing people we are told will enhance the UK\u2019s economic potential. As a young entrepreneur, Lord Sugar created the Amstrad line of computers, built from pre-assembled components into machines that ultimately became a footnote in the history of IT. However, he made most of his fortune \u2013 like so many British businesspeople \u2013 from property. No doubt most of his proteges will go down the same route. In the budget next month, Jeremy Hunt will laud entrepreneurs, and Labour will do the same. Before they do, a bit of evidence for their cheerleading would be nice."

            "content": "The smell of burning incense filled the room as Asha Grant, the owner of the Salt Eaters Bookshop, greeted folks who entered to attend Black Queer Speed Dating, one of many events put on in the community space. Attendees could grab name tags and enjoy a table spread filled with assorted fruits, meats and cheeses. To a visitor, the bookshop in Inglewood, California, is beautifully curated, with a memorial painting of Latasha Harlins, a Black girl who was killed by a Korean store clerk in 1991, contributing to the onset of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. The Salt Eaters Bookshop also hosts a community board filled with Black-centered events and businesses, and bright colors that catch the eye. In Grant\u2019s eyes, there\u2019s still work to be done. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know behind the scenes what it takes to keep a space running, to keep the lights on, to keep the A/C going, to keep the wifi ... , like all these things,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of output. I mean, it\u2019s worth it, but also like these spaces that people treasure and love are usually run by like one, two people, really not a lot of horsepower behind it. So it\u2019s like, yeah, I\u2019m giving ya all that I got until the end.\u201d Since its opening in 2020, the bookshop has been hit with financial challenges, including the rising cost of commercial rent. A survey conducted by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies found that 32% of Black small-business owners reported facing issues with the increasing cost of commercial rent. According to a 2017 survey conducted by California Reinvestment Coalition, now known as Rise Economy, 54% of California small-business owners reported that they often face displacement. The survey also reported that businesses owned by people of color often have to relocate due to landlords increasing commercial rent. A report by the National Association of Realtors found that commercial rent increased by 3.5% for retail spaces in 2023, which is higher than it was before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. As Grant celebrates entering a new three-year lease, she worries about the challenges that will come with it, including the annual increases. The new lease has increased the bookshop\u2019s total monthly budget for rent, utilities and general expenses by $500-$1,000, she added. With commercial rent rising despite limited funds, Grant knows having a community space in the Downtown Inglewood area means bracing for the impact. \u201cThe development is so rapid, and it\u2019s so violent,\u201d Grant said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only gonna go up from here.\u201d Grant started throwing rent parties in 2023 to help offset costs. The first had a theme: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Renaissance album. The bookshop threw another party a few months later, on Juneteenth, a second Renaissance celebration. One-hundred percent of the ticket sales for the parties went to the bookshop\u2019s rent relief fund, which remains live and is 60% under their goal. According to Grant, the proceeds have been able to offset a few months of the bookshop\u2019s rent. \u201cI don\u2019t want for the space to be threatened again,\u201d said Grant. \u201cI just don\u2019t.\u201d Salena Pryor, the president of Black Small Business Association of California, believes that Black community spaces were especially affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, as shutdowns led to many spaces being unable to keep up with the commercial rent. \u201cWhen [businesses] were able to get qualified for the PPP [Paycheck Protection Program] and EIDL [Economic Injury Disaster Loan], they were so far gone with the rent that \u2026 it was almost impossible for them to catch up,\u201d said Pryor. During the pandemic, small businesses owned by people of color suffered more closures than businesses owned by white people. According to a 2021 study conducted by researcher Robert Fairlie and published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, 2020 saw a 41% decrease in active Black small-business owners. A Yelp economic report found that Los Angeles suffered the most permanent business closures in the United States in 2020. Pryor asserts that Black businesses need to be financially supported for people to have a space to convene. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have the funding to do it, it\u2019s almost like the community suffers,\u201d said Pryor. \u201cWhen you start seeing these businesses close, you kind of take away the lifeblood of the community.\u201d At a garage sale hosted by Erdavria Rose Simpson, one of the owners and founders of the Lazy Rose Cafe, a Black-owned coffee shop that recently closed in Los Angeles, music from Hamilton played from a loudspeaker. Simpson used to play Hamilton and Disney songs at the Lazy Rose Cafe because they reminded her of being committed to service. Laid on two long tables at the garage sale were materials from the coffee shop, from tea bags to glass containers, ready to be sold to the same customers who had patronized the cafe. Born and raised in Los Angeles, Simpson was inspired to open the cafe after facing burnout in the navy and working in the Los Angeles mayor\u2019s office. She saw that Black women often had to work harder, and she wanted to create and cultivate a place where they could \u201ctake a lazy day\u201d. In 2020, Simpson, along with co-owners Antonio Martin, and Yvonne and Kevin Dunigan, opened he Lazy Rose Cafe in the Mid-City area and hosted tea parties and entrepreneurship workshops for the community. The Lazy Rose Cafe storefront closed for good in September 2023 due to lack of funds to sustain the increase in commercial rent and other business expenses. \u201cI\u2019m still thinking through a closure,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cI still desire to make a huge impact, especially [because] I\u2019ve always been community-minded. So it\u2019s like, OK, what\u2019s next?\u201d The garage sale alone won\u2019t be able to cover the amount lost from opening and maintaining the cafe, but for the owners, it\u2019s a way to let go and mourn. Simpson, with the other owners, put thousands of dollars of their personal savings into opening the cafe, she said. They installed improvements such as stairs and counters and purchased a water heater, in addition to paying $4,000 a month for rent the first year. The rent increased to $4,500 for the following two years. When the rent increased to $5,200, and the 52 grants the owners applied to seeking financial help were denied, it was time to close. Simpson says she and the co-owners had many discussions with Botach Management, the property management company they paid rent to, about lowering the rent but were never able to come to an agreement. Botach Management did not respond to requests for comment. Billi Sarafine, a frequent visitor and community member of the Lazy Rose Cafe, says she is still shocked the cafe is closed and will miss hosting her events in the space. \u201cWe had to look for other places to host our meetings,\u201d said Sarafine. \u201cThe spaces we are now at are not Black-owned, so it\u2019s not the same feeling of \u2018you belong here, you\u2019re safe\u2019. It\u2019s still a kind of side-eye. But we try to ignore that and just empower each other.\u201d Even though Andre Taylor isn\u2019t an avid coffee drinker, he brought a friend into the Lazy Rose Cafe one day and fell in love with the energy of the space. After engaging in a deep conversation with the owners that day about love and growth, he decided to join the community. \u201cI don\u2019t really get to see a lot of African Americans around me when I walk around the neighborhood,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cSo it was really nice to get a real Black feeling, if you know what I mean, within the space. After meeting them, I was just hooked.\u201d Since the closure of the Lazy Rose Cafe, Taylor has missed walking in and seeing the vibrancy of his people. \u201cTo see that empty space, it\u2019s really sad,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cThe community can really feel the absence of that.\u201d For Simpson, the only way to move forward was to shut the door fully. \u201cEven though I\u2019m kinda seeing different opportunities and trying to figure them out, I also have to afford myself the opportunity to mourn this one part of it and then get back out there with the objective being how best to serve in the mission that I set for minorities to have lazy days,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2024-02-04T08:30:39Z",
            "content": "What was unimaginable in the days of Jeremy Corbyn has become routine under Sir Keir Starmer. The rapprochement between Labour and capitalism was on lavish display last Thursday when a throng of business bosses crowded into an executive suite at the Oval cricket ground in south London for an audience with the Labour leader and Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor. Both told some 400 senior corporate leaders that Labour is now \u201cthe party of business\u201d. The mantra was repeated by Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, and Tulip Siddiq, the shadow City minister. Organisers gleefully reported that every \u00a31,000-a-head ticket for this all-day \u201cLabour business conference\u201d had been snapped up within four hours of being offered. Among the attendees were representatives from AstraZeneca, Barclays, HSBC, Goldman Sachs, Google, Legal &amp; General and Shell. No one said, as Ed Miliband once did as Labour leader, that elements of business act like \u201cpredators\u201d. The event was the most explicit demonstration yet of Labour\u2019s concerted effort to get close to business and to be seen to be close. There\u2019s clearly an audience among companies and investors for the message that they would be better off with Labour after the havoc inflicted by Brexit, the \u201cfuck business\u201d posture of Boris Johnson, the financial chaos unleashed by Liz Truss and Kamikaze Kwarteng, and Rishi Sunak\u2019s screeching U-turns over net zero and high-speed rail. One senior Tory involved in his party\u2019s effort to rebuild broken bridges with business reports that whenever he visits the chief executive of a FTSE 100 company he finds that \u201cRachel Reeves has got there before me\u201d. This romance invites the question: who is seducing whom? Is business falling head over heels for the steely charms of Ms Reeves and Sir Keir\u2019s chat-up lines about desiring \u201ca partnership\u201d? Or has Labour\u2019s leadership gone weak-kneed by gazing at the corporates through rose-tinted spectacles? Some of the attendees at Labour business events are genuine long-term supporters. There are also a few converts from across the aisle. Shortly before the schmoozefest at the Oval, Labour was delighted by an endorsement from Richard Walker, the boss of the Iceland supermarket chain and an erstwhile donor to the Tories. Truth to tell, the great majority of corporate executives aren\u2019t attracted to Labour because they have been melted by Sir Keir\u2019s inspirational oratory. They want to be in a relationship with Labour because they can read the opinion polls. Like bees to a honeypot, money swarms in the direction of power. Business chiefs almost universally expect that it will soon be Labour ministers who are deciding how they are regulated and how much they are taxed. That\u2019s why they want to rub shoulders with the next government. It is not so self-evident to all members of their party why Sir Keir and Ms Reeves seem mad keen to be seen as chummy with the captains of industry and bosom pals with the potentates of finance. The corporate world is not regarded with affection by the electorate. The most recent Ipsos Veracity Index gives business leaders a public trust score of 30 out of 100, just ahead of estate agents, but some way behind trade union officials. Nurses come top, as they always do. Don\u2019t ask about journalists. Labour\u2019s leadership reasons that while voters may not love big business, they do tend to associate entrepreneurship with success and aspiration, and Sir Keir would like to be associated with those things too. An even more important assumption in Labour\u2019s upper ranks is that it is good for their credibility if people who handle lots of money indicate that they think the party can be trusted not to crash the economy or wreck the national finances. The leadership has not just studied the New Labour playbook; there are people on Sir Keir\u2019s team who helped to write it. There\u2019s been conscious imitation of how Labour wooed business leaders over lunches and dinners \u2013 the so-called \u201cprawn cocktail offensive\u201d \u2013 in advance of Tony Blair\u2019s landslide election victory in 1997. Labour also thinks it is imperative that it is trusted by the City after the election. There will be rapid and severe trouble for a Starmer government if it doesn\u2019t command the confidence of the money-movers in financial markets. It is not simply to armour herself against Tory attacks that Ms Reeves puts so much relentless stress on her \u201ciron-clad commitment\u201d to \u201cfiscal responsibility\u201d. She doesn\u2019t want the \u201cbond vigilantes\u201d to pull the plug on a Labour government the way they went after Ms Truss when she shattered her credibility. The central pitch to business is that a Labour government will sustain a stable environment in which to invest and won\u2019t mess with company planning by constantly fiddling with the tax regime. Compare and contrast, they tell chief executives, with a Tory party so volatile it changed prime minister twice and chancellor three times in a single year. Labour also thinks it won\u2019t achieve its ambitions for government without the help of business. Sir Keir\u2019s boldest claim is that, under Labour, Britain can achieve the highest sustained growth in the G7. He is also promising that he can get 1.5m homes built in five years while accelerating the construction of critical infrastructure projects. He won\u2019t pull all that off without buy-in from business. There is persistent doubt about the strength of Labour\u2019s commitment to the green prosperity plan, its most future-facing and potentially transformational project. Making a success of that is heavily dependent on persuading the private sector to put more of its money into the transition to a carbon-free economy. Ms Reeves is offering some lollipops to business by pledging not to raise corporation tax above 25% in the first term of a Labour government and promising to retain the \u201cfull expensing\u201d regime that rewards companies with a tax break when they invest in new plant and technology. She upset some of her colleagues by saying that a Labour government will not reimpose a cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses. That came as a surprise because it is not so long ago she was whacking the Tories for scrapping the cap. There are issues with bringing it back. While popular with voters, there\u2019s little evidence the cap changed the behaviour of banks for the better. It is ineffective as a curb on excessive pay because there are other ways for banks to lavish lucre on top traders and executives. The argument Ms Reeves chose to make was that Britain needs a thriving financial sector because it employs a lot of people and generates a lot of revenues. While true enough, this didn\u2019t shield her from attacks by some on the left. The Scottish National Party seized on what it called a \u201cshameful\u201d volte-face as evidence for its claim that there is nothing to distinguish Labour from the Tories. There have even been some rumbles of dissent, a rarity these days, from within the shadow cabinet. Some of Ms Reeves\u2019 perplexed colleagues question the wisdom of Labour coming over as plutocrat-friendly when the typical voter has been so crunched by the cost of living crisis. That\u2019s a warning to the Labour leadership not to take its wooing of the City so far that it leaves everyone else feeling jilted. The zeal with which Labour is promoting itself as the party of business can make its approach to the world look more skewed than it actually is. Labour is also putting some demands on companies by saying it wants more done to address the gender pay gap and to improve the diversity of boardrooms. Labour hasn\u2019t resiled from its plans to abolish non-dom tax status, impose VAT on private school fees and close a lucrative tax loophole exploited by private equity dealmakers. It is also planning a significant increase in the responsibilities employers owe to those who work for them. This includes one pledge to ban zero-hours contracts and another to end the pernicious practice of fire and rehire. \u201cWe are going to level up workers\u2019 rights in a way that has not been attempted for decades,\u201d Sir Keir told the audience at the Oval. He added: \u201cThat might not please everyone in the room.\u201d And it didn\u2019t. Scratch below the surface of this apparent romance between Labour and business and you won\u2019t find true love. It\u2019s more a marriage of convenience. A Labour government will be in power to serve the whole country, not just one sectional interest, however important. Collaboration in the pursuit of common goals makes sense. Cosiness would be a mistake. Labour should be guided by Goldilocks when setting the temperature of its relationship with business. Not too cold, but not too hot either. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the Observer"

            "content": "Unions and workers\u2019 rights groups are urging the government to reconsider plans to reintroduce fees for employment tribunals amid fears it will encourage exploitation. A coalition of 48 organisations, including the TUC, Citizens Advice, Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the Fawcett Society and Maternity Action, said bringing back fees, which were ditched in 2017, meant \u201cbad employers are being given the go-ahead to undercut good ones\u201d. The government was forced to ditch a previous fee regime, under which charges ranged from \u00a3390 to \u00a31,200 depending on the case, after the supreme court ruled it was preventing access to justice, breaching UK and EU law. The number of cases brought by individuals dropped by almost 70% after the fees were first introduced in 2013 by Chris Grayling, the lord chancellor at the time. In a joint statement the workers\u2019 rights groups said the new fees, which start from \u00a355 to bring a claim, risked pricing many people out of workplace justice. \u201cWe believe [reintroducing fees] will deter many from lodging worthy claims and gives a green light to bad employers to exploit their workers,\u201d they said. \u201cBad employers are being given the go-ahead to undercut good ones, safe in the knowledge they are less likely to face claims in the employment tribunal \u2026 Employment rights are only real if they are enforced.\u201d While the initial fee can cover a claim on behalf of more than one person, an additional \u00a355 appeal fee would be charged for each judgment, decision, direction or order being appealed against. Some employment tribunal rulings, such as the hard-fought case over employment status by Uber drivers, faced multiple appeals hearings over many years, meaning that significant costs could still be racked up for claimants. The government said last month that it was on consulting on bringing back fees, arguing that the proposed costs were low enough to allow workers to pursue low-value claims. Help would also be available for those who could not afford the fee. There is also an exemption for individuals using a tribunal to claim their right to a payment from the national insurance fund, which usually relates to pension contributions or redundancy payments where an employer is insolvent. It said \u201ccareful consideration has been given to the lessons learned\u201d from 2017 and the new fees would be \u201cproportionate and affordable\u201d in line with the supreme court judgment. The consultation will run until 25 March. The government said the new fees would \u201censure users are paying towards the running costs of the tribunals and put its users on broadly the same footing as users of other courts and tribunals who already pay fees\u201d. It has said it expects the fees to generate up to \u00a31.7m a year from 2025, and that it cost \u00a380m to run employment tribunals last year. Paul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC, said working people should be able to enforce their rights. \u201cIntroducing fees for tribunals puts yet another hurdle in the way of those seeking justice at their most vulnerable moment. The Conservatives have already tried this and failed. \u201cLast time they introduced tribunal fees, claims dropped by two-thirds, and the supreme court threw fees out, saying they interfered with access to justice. \u201cThat should have been the nail in the coffin for these cynical plans, but ministers have decided to side with bad bosses over workers and resurrect employment tribunal fees.\u201d A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cOur consultation proposal to introduce a modest fee of \u00a355 would help save the taxpayer money and ensure our court system continues to run effectively and efficiently. \u201cWe are protecting access to justice for all and have launched a more generous scheme providing financial help for those who cannot afford to pay the proposed fees.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-29T14:00:21Z",
            "content": "A surge in employment combined with scant investment by firms to improve output triggered a sharp drop in worker productivity, limiting prospects for income growth without fanning inflation, the Productivity Commission said in its annual report. Across the economy, productivity fell 3.7% in 2022-23, as output growth failed to keep pace with a record 6.9% increase in hours worked, the commission said. A rush by employers to hire new staff was much higher than in previous bursts \u2013 the nearest comparison was the 4.3% rise in hours worked in 1988-89. \u201cAustralians\u2019 incomes grew in 2022-23, mostly because they worked more hours,\u201d said the commission\u2019s deputy chair, Alex Robson. \u201cBut productivity growth is about working smarter, not working harder or longer.\u201d With labour market participation hovering near its record 67%, the economy has little scope to generate higher incomes by adding workers or time on the job, he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse, we know nominal wage growth without productivity growth can fuel inflation,\u201d Robson said. \u201cSustainable, long-term wage growth can only be realised by securing productivity gains.\u201d Employers, though, were also not doing their bit. The capital-to-labour ratio, one measure of spending on equipment to improve output, fell by a record 4.9% for the year. \u201cSo while a record number of Australians had jobs, employers didn\u2019t invest in the equipment, tools and resources that are needed to make the most of employees\u2019 skills and talents,\u201d Robson said. \u201cFurther capital investment would help turn our strong employment growth into strong productivity growth.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Reserve Bank has been one of the economic institutions to warn wage increases had to be accompanied by increased productivity to avoid adding to inflation pressures and delaying any interest rate cuts. In its latest statement on monetary policy, released at its first board meeting of 2024, the RBA listed productivity outcomes as among \u201cstill highly uncertain\u201d outcomes in its forecast for how fast inflation may fall back to its 2%-3% target range. \u201cOther things equal, poor productivity outcomes would underpin higher-than-expected costs for businesses and put upward pressure on the prices paid by consumers,\u201d it said. Wages rose 4.2% last year, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, or slightly faster than the 4.1% inflation rate. That was the first time in about two years that the wage price index had exceeded its consumer price equivalent. Still, economists have been wary about reading too much into recent poor productivity results. One issue has been the lingering effects of the Covid pandemic disruptions, with many people spending more time working from home. And, as the Productivity Commission itself notes, the decline in hourly output per worker was partly the result of some of the extra hours worked being taken up by \u201cless experienced or less productive labour\u201d. Many of those jobs were also in \u201crelatively low\u2011productivity sectors\u201d such as retailing and hospitality, the report said. With the unemployment rate now creeping up to 4.1% in January from a half-century low of 3.4% in October 2022, output per hour was also beginning to improve. \u201cThe decline in labour productivity appears to have halted in the first quarter of the 2023-24 financial year, although this is largely attributable to a fall in hours worked,\u201d the bulletin said. By industry, labour productivity grew most in the professional, scientific and technical services sector, with a 3% increase. The wholesale trade industry posted the largest fall, at 11.4%, as hours worked jumped 15.7%. All up, 11 out of the 16 market sector industries reported a decline."

            "date": "2024-02-17T17:00:20Z",
            "content": "Britain has a sick economy and it is getting sicker. The clear message from last week\u2019s raft of economic data is that the UK is being held back by the growing number of people not able to work because of long-term illness. There are many theories about why the trend is worsening. Possible factors include long Covid, delays in NHS treatment as waiting lists grow longer, poor workplace practices, stress and the impact of austerity. But one thing is certain. The economic impact of ill health is a headache for Jeremy Hunt. It will be a headache for Rachel Reeves if she becomes the first female chancellor. It is a headache for every business that is struggling to fill vacancies. Figures released last week by the Office for National Statistics illustrated the extent of the problem. The number of people saying they are inactive due to long-term sickness is now 2.8 million \u2013 an increase of more than 200,000 in the past year and of 700,000 since the pandemic started in 2020. This matters, and not just for those who would be working if their circumstances were different. This high level of long-term illness helps explain why the UK\u2019s workforce is 700,000 smaller than its pre-Covid level, why the labour market is so tight and why the economy is flatlining. Jane Gratton, deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cBusinesses are growing increasingly concerned about higher levels of inactivity and its economic impact. It is impacting on growth and inflation. Wages are rising because of skills shortages. This has an effect on both employers and individuals.\u201d This is not a new issue. Large numbers of employees were invalided out of the workforce when factories and coalmines were closed in the de-industrialisation of the 1980s and 1990s. This century, Britain has had a higher percentage of people inactive due to ill health than Germany, France or Italy. But two new factors \u2013 Covid and longer NHS waiting lists \u2013 have made matters significantly worse in recent years. Yet what\u2019s especially worrying for economic policymakers is that Britain has gone from being the G7 country with the lowest levels of inactivity to the one where, uniquely, the workforce has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. The Office for Budget Responsibility has pointed out: \u201cThe available international evidence suggests that while the UK has consistently been a strong performer internationally in terms of working-age participation, its post-pandemic rise in inactivity stands out. And ill health has consistently been a bigger factor behind inactivity in the UK than in most other advanced economies, with post-pandemic trends likely to have amplified these differences.\u201d While it would be tempting to dub Britain the sick man of Europe, it would not be strictly accurate. Feminist thinktank the Women\u2019s Budget Group (WBG) has pointed out that there are 200,000 more women than men inactive due to ill health (1.5 million against 1.3 million). The WBG says this is not just down to Covid, but continues a trend that was evident before the pandemic. Zubaida Haque, the WBG\u2019s deputy director, said women were more likely to be in low-paid jobs and suffering the impact of austerity. \u201cThis has not been happening in a vacuum. Women were hit disproportionately by the pandemic but they were also more severely impacted by the benefit cuts made between 2010 and 2020. It is no good the government trying to deal with the symptoms of the problem.\u201d Hannah Slaughter, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the 2.8 million people inactive due to long-term sickness were a real concern: \u201cThis is holding back the economy, putting pressure on the public finances and the NHS, and limiting opportunities for too many people. Reversing this trend will be a priority for the current and next government.\u201d According to the Department for Work and Pensions, the government is already on the case. A spokesperson said: \u201cWith an extra 4 million people in work since 2010, we are now going even further, with welfare reforms forecast to reduce the number of people who would otherwise have been placed in the highest tier of incapacity benefits by over 370,000. \u201cOur back to work plan will help over a million people, including those with disabilities and long-term health conditions, to start and stay in work, as we continue to bring down inflation, cut taxes and grow the economy.\u201d One option for the government would be to try to fill the hundreds of thousands of job vacancies by tightening welfare conditions. But experts such as Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation thinktank, have warned that forcing people into work through punitive benefit sanctions would be counterproductive and might lead to more ill health. Whichever approach it decides to take, the government is under pressure to do more, both in terms of preventing illness, and in tailoring back-to-work programmes for those who take time off sick, ensuring that they don\u2019t exit the labour market altogether. While it is inactivity due to ill health that has grabbed the headlines recently, plenty of people with health problems are working, and are more likely to carry on if they get appropriate support. A study by the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank found people were more likely to leave work because of a heart condition than for any other health problem. The IPPR said someone suffering the onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 2021-22 had a 22% likelihood of leaving their job, compared with 14% for those with a mental health problem and 16% for those diagnosed with cancer. Chris Thomas, head of the IPPR\u2019s commission on health and prosperity, said: \u201cAfter great strides in tackling cardiovascular disease in the 20th century, the UK is now stalling, if not reversing. This is costing not just lives, but also livelihoods. The good news is that heart disease is one of the most preventable health conditions, but the government has to get on to the front foot and deliver proactive policies. Both human lives and economic prosperity depend on it.\u201d Gratton at the BCC said firms could help by allowing flexible working, investing more in occupational health and offering staff medical insurance. Jon Boys, senior research economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said the reduction in workers was compounding labour supply difficulties and limiting growth. There was ample evidence of both in last week\u2019s economic data, with the ONS reporting more than 900,000 job vacancies and unemployment below 4%, at a time when the UK economy was in recession. Boys said breaking down barriers to working for people with health problems should be a priority for policymakers and employers. Like Gratton, he said it was vital to focus on occupational health, to prevent individuals from exiting the workforce prematurely: \u201cIt is all very well getting people back into work but the bigger issue is not allowing them to fall out of it in the first place.\u201d Boys said both government and employers needed to address inactivity: employers through an awareness of the impact of stress in the workplace and addressing heavy and unsustainable workloads, and ministers by tackling NHS waiting lists. \u201cThe government has to recognise that health policy is economic policy,\u201d Boys said. \u201cThey can\u2019t be treated in silos.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-27T18:43:56Z",
            "content": "Puffing and wheezing its way on to the parliamentary agenda, the Department for Transport\u2019s long-promised bill to reform Britain\u2019s railways was finally published last week, in draft form. Almost certainly, given limited legislative time before the next election, it will never be voted into law. As Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, waspishly observed, it was fitting that this final act of strategic mismanagement should lead to a disastrously late arrival. It is six years since the government commissioned a review of the rail industry, following timetabling chaos in the north of England. Since then, multiple transport secretaries have presided over what has amounted to a rolling omnishambles. In the north, cancellations, late-running services and overcrowding have brought the network into disrepute. The cancellation of HS2 beyond Birmingham, and the related downgrading of Northern Powerhouse Rail, have made a mockery of the government\u2019s supposed levelling up ambitions. Nationally, ministers\u2019 mishandling of pay negotiations with unions has inflicted extended misery on travellers, and needlessly alienated an entire workforce. Most recently, government-backed plans to shut more than a thousand station ticket offices proved so unpopular that they were binned almost as soon as the public got wind of them. The common thread in this sorry sequence has been a refusal to invest sufficiently for the long term, and a blinkered determination to prioritise cost-cutting across the network. Since the pandemic, this Treasury-driven approach has assumed that the railways need to permanently adjust to a new reality, in which an economic model dependent on business travel no longer applies. Though passenger numbers are now back at 90% of the pre-Covid peak, revenues have not kept pace, and guaranteed income from commuter season tickets has fallen away. The new normal does not seem to have troubled the private companies that lease out Britain\u2019s trains \u2013 their profits trebled last year. But it is the lamentable shortsightedness in Whitehall that truly exasperates. According to forecasts from one specialist rail consultancy, the number of people travelling by train could double by 2050. This would be exactly the right direction of travel, helping the country make the necessary move to a greener transport network. Handled with imagination and flair \u2013 for example, in relation to ticketing \u2013 it could also deliver huge social benefits. But a misconceived austerity strategy is inflicting reputational damage as service standards drop, grievously undermining industry morale and risking a spiral of decline. Beyond a commitment to renationalise train operators as existing contracts expire, Labour has largely been keeping stumm about its own ideas. It has so far not ruled out creating an independent Great British Railways-type body to run the industry, as envisaged in the DfT\u2019s draft bill. But what the railways need above all is a government focused on growth not decline, which recognises the strategic importance of public transport in Britain\u2019s future. After a period in which industrial relations have reached rock bottom, the rail unions and train operators should be seen as partners in that wider vision. A new era of ambition and collaboration is required, after the scandalous dysfunction of recent years. The curtain must come down on a period in which passengers have been paying more for less, victims of an overbearing Treasury that has known the price of everything and the value of nothing."

            "content": "China is off track on all of its core 2025 climate targets, despite the fact that clean energy is now the biggest driver of the country\u2019s economic growth, analysis has found. After years of extraordinarily rapid growth, China is now grappling with a slowdown that is causing ripples internally and internationally. The government has supercharged the growth of the renewable energy industry but it has simultaneously poured stimulus funds into construction and manufacturing, and continues to approve coal power. China\u2019s total energy consumption increased by 5.7% in 2023, in the first moment since 2005 that demand for energy grew faster than its GDP. China\u2019s economy grew by 5.2% last year, a rate that would be rapid for most countries but is slow in comparison with previous rates of growth. But carbon dioxide emissions have continued to grow, even as economic growth has slowed due to the fact that China\u2019s economic growth during and after the Covid-19 pandemic has been highly energy intensive. Between 2021 and 2023, CO2 emissions grew at an average of 3.8% a year, up from 0.9% a year between 2016 and 2020. GDP growth slowed slightly over the same period. The findings were published in an analysis from Carbon Brief conducted by Lauri Myllyvirta, a lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). Under the Paris agreement, China\u2019s climate pledges require a number of targets to be met by 2025; these include increasing the share of non-fossil energy sources to 20% and reducing the carbon intensity of the economy by 18%. Carbon intensity refers to how many grams of CO2 are released to produce a kilowatt hour of electricity. However, Myllyvirta\u2019s analysis found that China was \u201cway off track\u201d on many of these targets, primarily because of the carbon intensity of recent economic growth. CO2 emissions will have to fall by between 4% and 6% to meet the government\u2019s 2025 target, Myllyvirta predicts. Part of the problem stems from the fact that during the Covid-19 pandemic, the government supported the economy by injecting stimulus measures into the construction and manufacturing sector, \u201cshifting the pattern of growth into a more carbon-intensive direction\u201d, said Myllyvirta. At the same time, many other countries targeted their stimulus measures towards households, driving up demand for consumer goods, resulting in an export boom from China. It is not impossible to do, said Myllyvirta: \u201cOptimistically, these distortions to the economic structure before and during zero-Covid could be reversed, and that combined with the clean energy drive could serve to bring down emissions rapidly.\u201d Around one percentage point of China\u2019s CO2 emissions growth last year came from manufacturing clean energy technologies, such as solar PV, electric vehicles and batteries. These products will ultimately lead to a net drop in emissions, although some of that will be felt outside China as goods are exported. Part of the challenge in understanding China\u2019s energy transition is that the numbers involved in every sector are of global significance. Despite the fact that, in 2023, China commissioned as much solar PV as the entire world did in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency, the rapid growth in energy demand in recent years has outstripped the clean energy additions. On the current trend of increased energy demands, energy production from non-fossil sources would need to grow by more than 11% a year to meet the 2025 target. Currently, renewable energy production is increasing by an annual rate of 8.5%. Clean energy contributed $1.6tn (\u00a31.26tn) to China\u2019s economy in 2023, accounting for all of the growth in investment. And on the target of reducing the carbon intensity of China\u2019s economy by 18% by 2025, China has so far managed only a 5% reduction since 2020. That means that CO2 emissions will have to come down in absolute terms from 2023 to 2025 to meet the target. According to the National Energy Administration, China\u2019s installed capacity of renewable energy exceeded 1.45bn kilowatts in 2023, accounting for more than half of the country\u2019s total installed power generation capacity. But a separate report published on Thursday by CREA and Global Energy Monitor found that China approved 114 gigawatts (GW) of coal power in 2023, up from 104 GW in 2022. China\u2019s share of global coal emissions surpassed 64% in 2023. Since Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, pledged to \u201cstrictly control\u201d new coal power in 2021, the approval of new coal has actually increased rapidly. Nearly half of the growth in power generation between 2020 and 2023 came from coal. That is partly because some thermal power developers and government officials see this decade as a window of opportunity in which CO2 emissions can continue to increase before 2030, when Xi has promised they will peak. Still, China is widely expected to meet that target by 2025. Local governments, particularly mining provinces, often rely on investment in coalmines and thermal power sources to boost their GDP figures. Myllyvirta said: \u201cThe major acceleration in coal consumption growth and in approvals of new coal power plants that has taken place since President Xi made these pledges in 2021 contradicts the commitments \u2013 and China needs to take determined action in 2024-25 to avoid failing to respect them.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 27 February 2024 to credit Global Energy Monitor as co-authors with CREA of one of the reports cited."

            "content": "The Bank of England governor has doused hopes that better-than-expected inflation news last month will accelerate cuts in interest rates, stressing the need for further evidence of wage moderation before Threadneedle Street moves. Appearing before the House of Lords economics committee on Wednesday, Andrew Bailey said it was \u201cencouraging\u201d that inflation had remained unchanged at 4% in January but the previous month\u2019s figure for the cost of living had been higher than predicted. Bailey said: \u201cWe slightly overshot last month and we slightly undershot this month. That leaves us pretty much where we were.\u201d Financial markets had been forecasting a rise in the annual inflation rate to 4.2% in January and now think the Bank will start cutting official borrowing costs from their current level of 5.25% in June. The governor said the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee \u2013 the nine-member body that sets interest rates \u2013 wanted to see more evidence of a cooling in wage rises before acting. It was likely pay bargainers would ask for smaller increases as inflation came down, he added. Bailey\u2019s comments came as the Aslef rail union announced new strike dates and a six-month extension to its mandate for industrial action. After the worst year for industrial unrest since 1989, average public sector pay grew by 5.9% in the last quarter of 2023 compared with the year before, while private sector pay rose 5.8%. Investors put the chance of a quarter-point cut in June at 60%, up from 40% before the data was released. Threadneedle Street had predicted a small rise in inflation last month, while economists polled by Reuters expected an increase to 4.2%. Bailey said it was \u201ctouch and go\u201d the UK economy was in technical recession \u2013 indicated by two successive quarters of falling output \u2013 in the second half of 2023 but there were signs of a \u201cmodest pick-up\u201d in activity in early 2024 that would continue thereafter. Hours earlier, the Office for National Statistics said inflation remained unchanged in January after the first fall in food prices in more than two years and deep discounts in the winter sales for clothing and furniture offset rising gas and electricity bills. Offering consumers some respite amid the cost of living crisis, the latest figures showed food and non-alcoholic drink prices fell at a monthly rate of 0.4% in January. It was the first monthly decline since May 2021, driven by price cuts on bread and cereals, cream crackers, sponge cake and chocolate biscuits. Against a backdrop of a tough Christmas for UK retailers because of weak consumer spending, furniture prices also fell at the fastest monthly rate in four years amid steep reductions for kitchens, leather settees, dining tables and chairs. Last month\u2019s better-than-predicted news on the cost of living is likely to be followed by a fall in inflation to below the government\u2019s 2% target within months, helped by a sharp fall in the Ofgem price cap in April amid a decline in wholesale energy prices. Inflation was last at 2% in July 2021 and rose to a peak of 11.1% in October 2022 before starting to decline. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cInflation never falls in a perfect straight line, but the plan is working; we have made huge progress in bringing inflation down from 11%, and the Bank of England forecast that it will fall to around 2% in a matter of months.\u201d Core inflation \u2013 which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, and is closely watched by the Bank \u2013 remained unchanged in January at 5.1%, according to the ONS. Services inflation rose to 6.5% in January, up from 6.4% a month earlier. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cAfter 14 years of economic failure, working people are worse off. Prices are still rising in the shops, with the average household\u2019s costs up \u00a3110 a week compared to before the last election.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-19T12:39:05Z",
            "content": "The Bank of England risks making the UK\u2019s recession worse unless it cuts interest rates soon to ease the pressure on households amid the cost of living crisis, its former chief economist has warned. Andy Haldane, who had been a leading advocate of raising interest rates before leaving the central bank in 2021, said there was a danger that the Bank could \u201ccrush the economy\u201d by keeping borrowing costs at the highest level in 16 years. Official figures released on Thursday showed Britain\u2019s economy fell into recession at the end of last year as hard-pressed consumers cut back on spending in response to high interest rates and elevated living costs. UK gross domestic product (GDP) fell by a larger than expected 0.3% in the three months to December after a decline in all main sectors of the economy and sharp decline in retail sales in the run-up to Christmas. It followed a drop of 0.1% in the third quarter. Economists regard two consecutive quarters of falling GDP as the definition of a recession. Asked whether there was a danger the Bank could make the recession worse unless it cut interest rates soon, Haldane told Bloomberg\u2019s UK Politics podcast: \u201cThat\u2019s where the balance of risks lies, yes. \u201cFor me the case for putting in place some upfront, early insurance on the monetary policy side is strong and strengthening, and I\u2019m fearful we leave that insurance a little too late in the year.\u201d Financial markets expect the Bank to begin cutting rates this summer from the current level of 5.25%, with a first reduction in borrowing costs anticipated from as early as June. Investors are pricing in a 17% chance of a cut in May, with the probability of a June cut at almost 50%. It comes after inflation held steady at 4% in January, defying expectations for a modest increase, after the first monthly fall in food prices for two years offset rising energy costs. Inflation had peaked at 11.1% in October 2022, a 41-year high. The Bank\u2019s policymakers have warned, however, that the UK faces ongoing inflationary risks from a tight jobs market and rising prices in the services sector of the economy. Andrew Bailey, the Bank\u2019s governor, and three other members of its rate-setting monetary policy committee are expected to give evidence to the Commons Treasury committee on Tuesday. Threadneedle Street had faced criticism for holding back on the start of its interest rate raising cycle until December 2021, when borrowing costs were set at a record low of 0.1%. Haldane was among critics at that time who warned higher rates were required to tackle soaring inflation. However, the Bank\u2019s former chief economist, who is now the chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts thinktank, has suggested he would have backed interest rate cuts from the end of last year as inflationary pressures fade and economic activity comes under pressure from higher borrowing costs. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have missed inflation on the way up, which happened, it\u2019s quite another to then have crushed the economy on the way down,\u201d Haldane said. \u201cThat double blow to credibility is one if I were a central banker, in my old job, I would be looking to avoid.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-28T03:49:41Z",
            "content": "Inflation remained flat in January at a two-year low, helped by falling prices for meat and seafood, stoking hopes the Reserve Bank may bring forward interest rate cuts. The consumer price index in January was 3.4%, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. Economists predicted CPI would increase to 3.6% from December\u2019s 3.4%. Food and non-alcoholic beverages reported a pick up in annual inflation to 4.4% last month from 4% in December. Meat and seafood prices, though, were down 2% from a year earlier compared with a 1.9% drop in December. Government intervention also helped reduce some of the price increases. Electricity prices, for instance, were 0.8% higher than a year ago in January, with rebates moderating the rise. \u201cExcluding the rebates, electricity prices would have increased 15.3% in the 12 months to January 2024,\u201d said Michelle Marquardt, ABS head of prices statistics. Rents continued to post large increases. The 7.4% rise in rental costs from January 2023 matched the rise reported for December, with vacancy rates remaining at or near historically low levels in some capitals. Treasurer Jim Chalmers said rents \u201cwould have risen 9.1% without our boost to Commonwealth Rent Assistance\u201d. \u201cThe direction of travel is clear: inflation is moderating helped by the Albanese government\u2019s cost-of-living policies,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cInflation is moderating in encouraging ways but we know it\u2019s not mission accomplished because people are still under the pump.\u201d Monthly CPI figures can be more volatile than quarterly ones because the ABS surveys only part of the basket of goods and services. Still, they provide a snapshot of inflationary pressures in the economy. The Reserve Bank wants to be sure inflation remains on course to return to within its target range of 2%-3% by next year and to about 2.5% by 2026. It raised its cash rate 13 times between May 2022 and November 2023 to a 12-year high of 4.35%. It noted in the minutes from its February board meeting that goods price inflation \u201chad declined more than expected\u201d. However, services inflation \u201cremained high and was still expected to decline only gradually\u201d. Prior to the CPI release investors estimated the chance of a cut in the RBA\u2019s key interest rate was about 5% when the board next meets on 18-19 March, according to the ASX\u2019s rates tracker. After a review of the central bank\u2019s operations released last year, the RBA board will now only meeting eight times a year instead of 11. Markets were little moved in the wake of today\u2019s CPI figures, with the Australian dollar hovering near 65.5 US cents and the stock market holding its losses for the day of about 0.1%. David Bassanese, chief economist at BetaShares, said \u201cAustralia\u2019s broad disinflationary trend remained intact during January with another lower-than-expected inflation result\u201d. \u201cAll up, today\u2019s CPI release should be broadly reassuring to the RBA and, on balance, reduces the risk it might consider yet another rate increases in coming months,\u201d Bassanese said, adding the numbers reinforced his view that the central bank would be able to cut interest rates at least twice in the final months of 2024. Besa Deda, chief economist for Westpac\u2019s business division, said the January CPI figure means the commercial bank\u2019s quarterly CPI forecast of 0.7% may have to be revised lower. \u201cWe think the rate-hiking cycle has ended and today\u2019s result is further evidence of that,\u201d Deda said. \u201cWe continue to expect that cuts are still a second-half 2024 story because the RBA has suggested it wishes to be convinced of further progress being made on inflation.\u201d As households change their spending habits over the years, the ABS has to adjust the weighting given to each category to estimate how much overall prices are changing in the economy. On Wednesday, the ABS updated the basket of goods and services, bringing some of the weightings closer to pre-Covid levels. During the pandemic lockdowns, households spent more on appliances, furniture and other equipment, including computers, and much less on travel and restaurants. The share of goods reached 58% of the CPI index at one point, and just 42% on services. The 2024 update has revised the share to 54.5% for goods and 45.5% for services, a move that \u201creflects spending patterns closer to the pre-Covid-19 period\u201d, the ABS said. The recreation and culture group category has seen a big adjustment, rising 1.71 percentage points in the rejig. The fact more Australians headed overseas and with international airfare prices remaining elevated, the weighting of this sub-category increased 0.92pp. Overseas arrivals and departures are now back to about 90% of pre-Covid levels, the ABS said. In January\u2019s figures alone, holiday travel and accommodation was 7.1% cheaper than a year earlier, not far off the 9.1% year-on-year drop reported in December. After the 2024 CPI weighting update, housing remained the largest category, accounting for 21.74% of the overall index. That was half a percentage point lower than for last year, dragged down by fewer people buying new homes. Food and non-alcoholic beverages, with a weighting of 17.15%, were little changed from the 2023 index. Recreation and culture at 12.55% leapfrogged transport\u2019s 11.42% to contribute the third largest weighting within the CPI index."

            "title": "Bank of England sticks with 5.25% interest rate but hints at coming cut",
            "date": "2024-02-01T12:26:58Z",
            "content": "The Bank of England has dropped the broadest possible hint that the next move in interest rates will be downwards after forecasting inflation will fall below 2% within months, despite keeping borrowing costs unchanged for a fourth consecutive time. Threadneedle Street stressed that more evidence was required that inflation would stick at the target set by the government before the Bank could deliver a first cut to borrowing costs since the start of the pandemic. It warned that risks from fast-rising prices remained amid the cost of living crisis. In a widely expected decision, the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted by a majority to keep interest rates at the current level of 5.25%, the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. However, one member of the panel \u2013 the independent economist Swati Dhingra \u2013 pushed for an immediate reduction in borrowing costs, in a powerful signal to financial markets that the central bank was edging closer to taking action. The Bank issued a sharp downgrade in forecasts for inflation, pencilling in a fall below 2% in May for the first time since early 2021, although it warned it was likely to return above the target rate later this year amid robust pay growth in the British economy and the fading impact from lower energy prices. Andrew Bailey, the Bank\u2019s governor, said: \u201cWe have had good news on inflation over the past few months. It has fallen a long way, from 10% a year ago to 4%. But we need to see more evidence that inflation is set to fall all the way to the 2% target, and stay there, before we can lower interest rates.\u201d Financial markets had predicted rates would be left unchanged for a fourth consecutive time after a steady decline in inflation over recent months, despite a small increase in December from 3.9% to 4%, with City investors anticipating a first rate cut from as early as June. The Bank has left borrowing costs unchanged since September, having paused its most aggressive hiking cycle in decades. The central bank lifted rates from a record low of 0.1% in December 2021, driving up the cost of mortgages and loans for millions of households. The prospect of interest rate cuts will provide a boost for Rishi Sunak as the prime minister prepares to send voters to the polls in a general election expected this autumn. Financial markets are anticipating a reduction in borrowing costs of up to 1 percentage point. Interest rates and inflation falling as financial markets expect would also provide a tailwind for economic growth, with the Bank pencilling in a modest upgrade to its GDP forecasts from zero growth this year to about a quarter of a percentage point. However, it warned inflation was only on track to fall \u201ctemporarily\u201d below 2% this spring before rising back to about 2.75% before the end of the year and remaining above the target for the rest of its three-year forecast, fuelled by the \u201cpersistence of domestic inflationary pressures\u201d in the services sector and labour market. It also warned of risks over the coming months from disruption to shipping in the Red Sea amid the Israel-Gaza war, with the potential to drive up consumer prices in Britain. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect [inflation at 2%] to be the sustained level. It\u2019s going to rise somewhat thereafter,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cThis is not back to 10%, let\u2019s be clear. But that\u2019s not an acceptable state of affairs as a resting place, so it\u2019s important we do the rest of the work.\u201d Exposing a three-way split on the committee amid concerns over the potential for inflationary pressures becoming entrenched, two members of the MPC \u2013 the independent economists Jonathan Haskel and Catherine Mann \u2013 pushed for a further quarter-point increase in the Bank rate. A majority of six members \u2013 including Bailey \u2013 voted to keep rates on hold. Reflecting concerns over stubbornly high inflation, the Bank highlighted robust levels of wage growth expected this year in surveys conducted by its network of agents across the country, which found companies were planning to offer pay settlements of about 5.4% this year, only slightly below the levels seen in 2023. It also insisted that borrowing costs would \u201cneed to be restrictive for an extended period\u201d to return inflation sustainably to its 2% target, while indicating that it was prepared to keep them under review before taking action. Bailey said the question was how long the Bank needed to maintain rates at elevated levels, but added: \u201cIt is too soon to take that decision, we need some more evidence.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-15T02:03:52Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s jobless rate jumped to a two-year high in January as employers barely added any jobs and more people started to look for work. The economy added 11,100 full-time jobs and shed 10,600 part-time roles, leaving a net gain for the month of just 500 jobs. The jobless rate last month was 4.1%, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. That result compared with economists expecting the rate to tick up to 4% from December\u2019s reported 3.9% with a net increase of 25,000 jobs. \u201cThis was the first time in two years, since January 2022, that the unemployment rate had been above 4%,\u201d said Bjorn Jarvis, ABS head of labour statistics. Part of the increase in the jobless rate was because more people started to look for work at the start of the year although the participation rate remained unchanged from December at 66.8%. \u201cOur labour market has been weakening but it has been weakening from a quite incredibly strong and resilient base,\u201d the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, told a media conference in Canberra. \u201c[W]e enter this period of economic uncertainty from a position of genuine strength and the labour market is a big part of that story.\u201d Labour market figures have been volatile in recent months, with November jobs jumping 61,500 only for 65,200 to be lost in December, according to preliminary numbers. Economists estimate the economy needs to add about 30,000 jobs a month to keep the unemployment rate steady as the population swells. The Reserve Bank will be watching today\u2019s employment figures as its assesses the impact of 13 increases of official interest rates since May 2022 that have lifted the cash rate to a 12-year high. RBA governor Michele Bullock told senate estimates earlier on Thursday:\u201cWe think we\u2019re in a good position to get inflation down in a reasonable amount of time while still keeping employment growing,\u201d she said. Hours worked in January fell by 49m, continuing a trend downwards since the middle of 2023. \u201cSince October 2023, the annual growth rate in hours worked has slowed considerably, down to 0.7% in January 2024, and well below the annual employment growth of 2.6%,\u201d Jarvis said. Investors viewed the labour market figures as further reducing the chances of another RBA interest rate rise. The Australian dollar was down about 0.1 US cents to 64.9 US cents and the ASX 200 share index extended gains for the day by about 0.1 percentage points to 0.9%. Lower interest rates make it less attractive to hold the Aussie dollar while also making it cheaper for firms to borrow. Prior to today\u2019s jobs figures, investors had fully priced in an RBA cut of 25 basis points in the cash rate to 4.1% by November, according to the ASX rates tracker. \u201cThe swift weakening in labour market conditions raises some doubts as to whether we will see an orderly easing in conditions in 2024,\u201d Sean Langcake, head of macroeconomic forecasting for Oxford Economics Australia, said. \u201c[P]olicy makers will be a little more concerned about the outlook after today\u2019s data.\u201d Sarah Tan, an economist with Moody\u2019s Analytics, said \u201ccracks are emerging in the Aussie labour market\u201d but forward indictors still pointed to \u201crobust employment demand\u201d. \u201cDecember survey data from the Australian Department of Jobs and Skills showed 20% of respondents were looking to bring on more staff over the next three months,\u201d Tan said. \u201cSome 5% were looking to trim their workforces, compared with 3% in November.\u201d Job vacancies also remained more than 70% above pre-pandemic levels with employers seeking about 400,000 workers. Population growth, though, was likely to exceed job generation, pushing the jobless rate to 4.5% by December, she said. New South Wales, the state that accounts for about a third of the economy, has dropped back to the pack with seasonally adjusted unemployment rate matching the national average at 4.1%. The state boasted a 3.4% jobless rate six months ago, compared with 3.7% for Australia overall. Victoria and the Northern Territory recorded the lowest unemployment rate at 3.9%, down from December\u2019s rate of 4% and 4.5%, respectively. Tasmania, where voters go to the polls for a state election on 23 March, saw its jobless rate jump from 3.6% in December to 4.5% last month. Queensland, which is also going to the polls later this year, has seen its unemployment rate edge lower, from 4.5% in July to 4.2% last month."

But as we started reporting, our team kept finding ourselves drawn to the people whose lives were becoming intertwined with AI. We realised: this was not just a series about an extraordinary advance in technology, it was about what it means to be human in an age where machines are gaining the power to comfort us, cure diseases, fight wars and automate our work (except making podcasts!). Black Box is a snapshot of the first moments when everything started to change.\u201d Nicole Jackson, head of audio, Guardian News &amp; Media, said: \u201cBlack Box is a brilliant deep dive into the complex world of AI. Using narrative storytelling, the team have found extraordinary stories to illustrate the ways in which this new intelligence is going to change everything - for the better and for the worse. From meeting scientists who are behind what could be the most impactful invention of this century to hunting down Russian coders who are using AI to wreak havoc around the world, the question the podcast continually probes is: as we give more and more power to AI, what will it mean for all of our lives?\u201d Black Box is the Guardian\u2019s next narrative podcast after the release of the chart-topping and critically acclaimed Can I tell you a Secret?. Following the podcast\u2019s success a new two-part documentary of the same name has been released on Netflix and is a number one rated series, based on original reporting by the Guardian. The Guardian has been creating podcasts for over 17 years. We\u2019re currently one of the leading podcast producers in the UK, with a combined podcast network that enjoys millions of listens every month. Recent highlights include: Popular food podcast Comfort Eating with Grace Dent is now in its sixth season, with new weekly episodes featuring the likes of Katie Price, Amol Rajan, Kathy Burke, Michelle de Swartz and more chatting about life through food. Flagship daily news podcast Today in Focus recently turned five. One of the Guardian\u2019s most successful podcasts to date, since launching in November 2018, the podcast has achieved over a phenomenal 250 million all-time listens.

            "title": "Don\u2019t wait for Post Office-style scandal before regulating AI, ministers told",
            "date": "2024-02-06T00:01:46Z",
            "content": "Ministers have been warned against waiting for a Post Office-style scandal involving artificial intelligence before stepping in to regulate the technology, after the government said it would not rush to legislate. The government will acknowledge on Tuesday that binding measures for overseeing cutting-edge AI development are needed at some point \u2013 but not immediately. Instead, ministers will set out \u201cinitial thinking for future binding requirements\u201d for advanced systems and discuss them with technical, legal and civil society experts. The government is also giving \u00a310m to regulators to help them tackle AI risks, as well as requiring them to set out their approach to the technology by 30 April. However, the Ada Lovelace Institute, an independent AI research body, said the government should not wait for an impasse with tech firms or errors on the scale of the Post Office scandal before it acted. Michael Birtwistle, an associate director of the institute, said: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be waiting for companies to stop cooperating or for a Post Office-style scandal to equip government and regulators to react. There is a very real risk that further delay on legislation could leave the UK powerless to prevent AI risks \u2013 or even to react effectively after the fact.\u201d The potential for misuse of technology and its impact on people\u2019s lives has been thrown into stark relief by the Horizon scandal, where hundreds of post office operators were wrongfully pursued through the courts due to a faulty IT system. The government has so far used a voluntary approach to regulating the most advanced systems. In November it announced at a global AI safety summit that a group of major tech companies, including the ChatGPT developer OpenAI and Google, had agreed with the EU and 10 countries, including the US, UK and France, to cooperate on testing their most sophisticated AI models. In its response to a consultation on the AI regulation white paper, the government is sticking to its framework of established regulators \u2013 such as the communications watchdog, Ofcom, and the data regulator, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office \u2013 regulating AI with reference to five core principles: safety, transparency, fairness, accountability and the ability of newcomers to challenge established players in AI. \u201cAI is moving fast, but we have shown that humans can move just as fast,\u201d said the technology secretary, Michelle Donelan. \u201cBy taking an agile, sector-specific approach, we have begun to grip the risks immediately, which in turn is paving the way for the UK to become one of the first countries in the world to reap the benefits of AI safely.\u201d The government is also expected to confirm that talks between copyright holders and tech companies over treatment of copyrighted materials to build AI tools have failed to produce an agreement. The Intellectual Property Office, the government agency charged with overseeing the UK\u2019s copyright regime, had been attempting to draw up a code of practice but could not broker an agreement. The failure of the talks was first reported by the Financial Times. The use of copyright-protected content in building AI tools such as chatbots and image generators, which are \u201ctrained\u201d on vast amounts of data culled from the internet, has become one of the most legally contentious aspects of the boom in generative AI, the term for technology that instantly produces convincing text, image and audio from hand-typed prompts. Matthew Holman, a partner at the UK law firm Cripps, said: \u201cUltimately, AI developers need clarity from UK government about how they can safely conduct data collection and systems training without being constantly at risk of a copyright claim for countless rights holders. \u201cAt the same time, copyright proprietors require help protecting their valuable intellectual property, which is being routinely copied without permission.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-19T00:01:07Z",
            "content": "The amount of fraud committed in the UK more than doubled to \u00a32.3bn in 2023, marking the second-biggest year for scams in the last two decades, according to a report that also warns of the future impact of fraudsters using artificial intelligence to rip off consumers. The accounting firm BDO\u2019s latest FraudTrack report found that the number of reported cases rose by 18% to a three-year high, and the number of high-value cases over \u00a350m increased by 60% year-on-year in 2023. Half of the high-value frauds were over \u00a3200m. BDO said factors behind the overall rise included the growing popularity of online scams, phishing and system breaches, as well as authorised push payment (APP) transactions, where fraudsters trick people into transferring money to them. \u201cAnalysis of the data over the last decade shows the number of reported cases of fraud is rising and the amounts involved are getting bigger,\u201d said Kaley Crossthwaite, a partner at BDO. \u201cAnd we believe that it is likely to continue to do so. The sad reality is that the fraudsters will be looking to stay one step ahead by exploiting new options like AI.\u201d UK banks have warned of \u201can epidemic of scams\u201d. Barclays said last year that more than 70% of scams were happening on social media, online marketplaces and dating apps. London and the south-east of England remained the biggest fraud hotspot, with a 170% year-on-year increase in value as a result of several high-profile cases, and a 43% increase in reported cases. Major cases last year included Entain, the owner of the Ladbrokes and Coral betting chains, reaching a \u00a3585m settlement with HM Revenue and Customs, the UK\u2019s tax authority, over alleged bribery at a business it owned in Turkey. The former Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone also pleaded guilty to fraud after being accused of failing to declare more than \u00a3400m of overseas assets to the UK government. He agreed to pay HMRC \u00a3652m. The region with the second-highest level of reported fraud was the east Midlands, which jumped from 12th place in 2022. BDO said the true overall level of fraud was likely to be significantly higher than \u00a32.3bn because statistics from the Crime Survey for England and Wales had revealed that fewer than one in seven offences are reported to the police. A report last year found that the number of people committing \u201charmless\u201d fraud, such as cheating on their council tax or trying to reclaim money on lost gambling bets, had soared amid the cost of living crisis."

            "date": "2024-02-21T22:04:29Z",
            "content": "The artificial intelligence boom is pushing demand for Nvidia\u2019s products past Wall Street\u2019s already lofty expectations. The chipmaker beat analyst expectations on Wednesday by leaps and bounds when it reported fourth-quarter earnings, posting $22.1bn in revenue on an expected $20.55bn and $4.93 in earnings per share against an expected $4.64. Revenue was 22% higher than the previous quarter, up 265% from a year ago. Nvidia\u2019s most closely watched earnings figure \u2013 revenue from data centers \u2013 was up more than 400% from the same period last year, reaching $18.4bn. Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a press release: \u201cAccelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\u201d Nvidia\u2019s revenue and demand for its shares are seen as bellwethers for overall interest in artificial intelligence due to the heavy reliance on its wares in developing AI. Microsoft, OpenAI, Amazon, Meta and Google have all struck deals with the company to purchase its chips in bulk as they race to release new AI products and features. Some key players, including OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman, are toying with starting their own AI chip ventures to compete with the established Nvidia, which would probably cost hundreds of billions of dollars. Nvidia plans to ship a new chip, the B100, at the highest end of its products line in 2024, stoking expectations around its explosive growth. Nokia and Nvidia announced a partnership on Wednesday to develop AI solutions that could improve telecommunications infrastructure. Wall Street has come to expect enormous growth from Nvidia; the baseline analyst expectation on Wednesday was a 240% increase in revenue. Tech companies are rushing to create AI products on the back of the company\u2019s specialized AI chips and software, considered among the best on the market. Nvidia\u2019s revenue tripled in the last quarter, and its earnings have beaten analyst expectations for the past four. Its stock has more than tripled in value over the past year, bringing the company above the $1.5tn valuation threshold. The company surpassed Google and Amazon in market capitalization last week, becoming the third-largest company in the world by value for a few days."

            "title": "We must start preparing the US workforce for the effects of AI \u2013 now | Steven Greenhouse",
            "date": "2024-02-29T11:01:14Z",
            "content": "As artificial intelligence spreads rapidly across America\u2019s economy, there\u2019s a lively debate about how it will transform the future of work. What many people fail to realize is that AI has already changed millions of workers\u2019 jobs \u2013 often for the worse. At Amazon, some warehouse and delivery drivers complain that AI-driven bots have fired them without any human intervention whatsoever. At some companies, surveillance apps track how much time workers spend in trips to the bathroom, with some workers protesting that the time limits are too strict. Many corporations gather information about their employees through webcams, keyboards, internet activity and phone logs, and that can include private information about workers\u2019 political opinions, sexual orientation, union activity and even their emotions and mental state. Inside many call centers, AI tools monitor the calls that agents make, and based on factors like the agent\u2019s or customer\u2019s tone of voice, those tools often send messages to an agent\u2019s computer, directing them to talk with more empathy or energy. And then there are the forecasts that AI will wipe out millions of jobs. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that by 2030, tasks that account for up to 30% of the hours now worked across the US could be automated, and that AI will push 12 million American workers out of their jobs. Goldman Sachs predicts that AI will disrupt 300m jobs worldwide by 2030. C-suite executives can\u2019t wait to deploy more AI in their offices, warehouses and factories, but many workers, white-collar and blue-collar alike, worry that AI will mean only bad news for them: more stress, surveillance, and speed-ups, and more layoffs, too. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way. In Germany and several other European countries, workers often have a voice in how their employers roll out and use artificial intelligence. German law requires that companies notify their works councils (worker-management committees that exist in most German workplaces) in advance about any plans to introduce AI. Those councils often then discuss how to use AI, typically with an eye to having it complement workers and make them more productive, instead of replacing them. Virginia Doellgast, a Cornell University expert on AI and work, told me that the German model, with its works councils and strong unions, leads to less employee resistance to AI, smoother rollouts of AI-related technologies, and increased productivity that benefits companies and workers alike. But in the United States, a country where workplace decisions are typically top-down with employees having little or no input, workers often feel like victims and guinea pigs when it comes to AI. Indeed, many workers don\u2019t even know when their employers are using AI to surveil them or speed up their jobs. Labor leaders wish that US workers could have a strong voice in how AI is introduced and implemented, but that\u2019s wishful thinking in a nation where just 6% of workers in private industry are in labor unions. At unionized workplaces, but not non-union ones, employees have a right not only to negotiate about AI when it substantially affects working conditions, but also to push for protections against some of AI\u2019s worst effects. Hollywood\u2019s writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 unions won important protections on AI in the negotiations that settled their lengthy strikes last year. One labor leader told me that unions certainly recognize that new technologies can increase productivity and overall prosperity. But he added that AI-related technologies often \u201cspeed up the work, deskill the work, make workplaces more stressful and make jobs more demanding\u201d. At some companies, AI-powered tools keep tabs on whether employees meet their production quotas, and those tools sometimes automatically increase the quotas of employees who regularly meet them. With employers increasingly using AI to screen r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, AI has faced complaints about discriminating against older applicants, women, people of color and workers with disabilities. At many call centers, AI-powered apps review the transcripts of agents\u2019 conversations with customers and sometimes give warnings or demerits to agents for straying too far from the assigned script. Some economists warn that if corporations can roll out AI with little input from workers, then AI will increase production and profits for corporations, with few or any gains for workers \u2013 all while increasing the nation\u2019s overall income inequality. Workers will suffer from speed-ups, stress and layoffs, and society at large may have to finance tens of billions of dollars in unemployment insurance, health coverage and perhaps food and rent assistance for many who lose their jobs to AI. To minimize AI\u2019s negative effects on America\u2019s 160 million workers, there are many things government, labor and business should do. Government should require companies to notify their workers when they\u2019re using AI tools to monitor them. Recognizing that workers aren\u2019t in a position to assess the downsides of AI, Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO union federation, has called for having a government agency vet AI technologies to determine whether they\u2019re harmful to workers \u2013 just as the FDA vets drugs to make \u201csure drugs don\u2019t kill people before they\u2019re put out into the world\u201d. With AI threatening to cause large-scale layoffs, the government should create incentives for employers to embrace four-day, even three-day workweeks to spread the work around and minimize layoffs. For example, if AI makes a 1,000-employee company consider laying off 200 people, that company could avoid layoffs by shifting its 1,000 employees to four-day workweeks. Labor unions need to snap to attention on AI and educate workers, both union and non-union, about AI\u2019s harms and benefits \u2013 it can mean more invasiveness, but also increase productivity and hopefully workers\u2019 wages, too. Unions should also educate workers about how to press their employers to reduce AI\u2019s harms and to share the fruits of AI so that workers, and not just shareholders, benefit from the increased productivity and profits it produces. (The AFL-CIO\u2019s Technology Institute is already doing some of this educating.) Unions should press companies to use AI in ways that complement rather than displace workers, and that means pushing for enhanced training to help employees work with AI. Unions should of course keep up their efforts to unionize tech workers. As for business, Michael Richards, policy director at the US Chamber of Commerce\u2019s technology engagement center, said that \u201cwhile there are clear benefits\u201d to AI, \u201cthere are legitimate concerns\u201d surrounding the technology. Richards said companies \u201crecognize that engaging in an inclusive dialogue about using new technologies is critical\u201d. Such a dialogue could reduce workers\u2019 distrust of AI and encourage employee input, for instance, about ways to tweak AI tools to have them work more efficiently alongside workers. There\u2019s little doubt that AI will bring big changes, good and bad, to America\u2019s workplaces. To reduce AI\u2019s harmful effects, President Biden should create a panel of government, union and business officials, much like the tripartite boards that President Franklin Roosevelt created to maximize arms production during the second world war. This new panel should make recommendations about how best to use AI in America\u2019s workplaces, all with the goal of maximizing AI\u2019s benefits for the nation and sharing the gains from AI while minimizing the pain for workers.

            "title": "US voters face a stark choice on foreign policy \u2013 and they might prefer Trump\u2019s offer | Emma Ashford",
            "date": "2024-02-28T07:00:30Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump has all but clinched the Republican presidential nomination, kicking off a US general election campaign between two elderly one-term presidents, each of whom is profoundly unpopular in their own way. Perhaps more unusually for the US, however, it also kicks off an election in which the foreign policy stakes are far higher than usual, and one in which the two presidential rivals offer radically different visions of the US\u2019s role in the world. Political scientists have long known that American voters do not typically vote on foreign policy issues, which pale in comparison with economic or social issues. In 2024, however, that rule is not likely to hold. A plethora of recent polls suggest that Americans are increasingly concerned about foreign policy; one survey found that four in 10 voters rank the issue among their top concerns. This may all be less surprising than it at first appears. With two major wars overseas and growing perceptions of a threat from China, foreign policy seems more urgent in 2024 than it has in years. But the trend is also bolstered by the fact that politicians are increasingly framing questions of domestic industrial policy, energy policy and even immigration as foreign policy or national security issues. And, unlike many previous contests, there is a sharp dichotomy between the two parties. Joe Biden seems determined to stake his presidency on foreign policy issues; his speeches in recent months have sought to tie his stewardship of the war in Ukraine \u2013 and support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza \u2013 to the survival of democracy here at home in America. His October Oval Office speech argued that: \u201cAmerican leadership is what holds the world together.\u201d Whether or not this is wise, Biden clearly views his own legacy as primarily that of a foreign policy president \u2013 and views democracy around the world as the pivotal issue of our times. Trump, meanwhile, has always espoused a harder-edged nationalist worldview, one that flies in the face of Biden\u2019s vision of America as the world\u2019s police officer. Earlier this month, he told supporters he wouldn\u2019t protect Nato member states that didn\u2019t meet the alliance\u2019s defence spending targets \u2013 and indeed would, perhaps, welcome a Russian attack on Europe. The overall picture is likely to be one of clashing grand narratives: Trump\u2019s America First nationalism versus Biden\u2019s global pro-democracy crusade. Both sides will be described with smears: Trump will undoubtedly argue that Biden is a globalist who puts foreign countries\u2019 needs above the interests of American voters, whether factory workers in Ohio or US soldiers stationed in the Middle East. Biden, on the other hand, will argue that Trump is an isolationist who doesn\u2019t understand the US\u2019s vital role as the indispensable nation, promoting global peace and stability. One suspects that this battle \u2013 combined with ongoing chaos in world affairs \u2013 is not likely to favour Biden. US voters are increasingly sceptical about the idea that America is the world\u2019s indispensable nation; and young voters in particular are dubious about the Biden administration\u2019s commitment to human rights and appalled by his support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Biden\u2019s other problem, of course, is that it is easier to criticise than to fix complex international problems. Where Biden may be able to make inroads is in reminding voters of how mercurial and chaotic Trump\u2019s first presidency was. After all, Trump was in love with Kim Jong-un \u2013 who sent him the sweetest letters \u2013 long before he turned against \u201clittle rocket man\u201d. Trump made no secret of his attempts to woo Xi Jinping before turning to trade war against China. And he was against intervention in Syria, for it, and then against it once again. A second Trump presidency would no doubt include much of the same volatility, protestations from his supporters that better staffing can resolve this problem notwithstanding. But we can make some predictions about a second Trump presidency with a reasonable amount of confidence. In practice, he will probably take a significantly harder line on China, including new tariffs and trade restrictions. Prominent conservatives likely to hold roles in his administration \u2013 such as former deputy assistant secretary of defence Elbridge Colby \u2013 are notable China hawks, and Trump\u2019s animus towards free trade is well known. He will almost certainly deprioritise Europe in favour of Asia. His congressional allies, already sceptical of Ukraine aid, are unlikely to approve significant further spending or arms to Kyiv. Perhaps the biggest potential foreign policy danger lies on the US\u2019s southern border, where the growing influx of migrants from around the world claiming asylum is increasingly perceived by many Americans to be a threat. Trump has promised to treat this as a national security issue, pledging to deploy troops to the border, and potentially even engaging in military action against cartels in Mexico or elsewhere. This is a potential disaster. The US\u2019s 20-year, festering insurgency campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan were bad enough; a similar campaign on its southern border could be much worse. Then there are elements of a second Trump administration that might look surprisingly consistent; the Biden administration has already maintained a remarkable number of Trump policies, from the China tariff wars to the embrace of Saudi-Israel normalisation. Yet elections are as much about narrative as anything else, and Trump will benefit throughout 2024 from the ability to criticise Biden\u2019s foreign policy record and present his own vision of a slimmed-down America First approach. Indeed, polling suggests that this could have significant appeal for voters: a majority of Americans think it is time to push for a negotiated settlement in Ukraine, while a plurality believe that the US should either downsize or withdraw troops completely from Europe and want the US to play a major, but not leading, role globally. At the end of the day, it remains impossible to accurately predict anything when it comes to Trump; his conduct in office never bore a strong resemblance to his rhetoric. But as the commotion over the US\u2019s commitments to Nato shows, foreign policy is likely to be a significant issue throughout this year\u2019s presidential campaign, and one that \u2013 perhaps counterintuitively \u2013 plays to Trump\u2019s strengths. After 20 years of democracy promotion and Middle Eastern wars \u2013 and four years that have seen so much upheaval and crisis in international affairs \u2013 can the Biden campaign really be sure that Trump\u2019s vision of a US that looks after its own interests first will not resonate with voters? That\u2019s a risky bet. Emma Ashford is a senior fellow with the Reimagining US Grand Strategy programme at the Stimson Center, Washington DC, and the author of Oil, the State and War"

            "date": "2024-02-18T12:58:38Z",
            "content": "Politicians, diplomats, civil society representatives and businesspeople met for the third and last day of this year\u2019s Munich Security Conference. David Lammy, the British shadow foreign secretary, said that he wants a new security pact between the EU and the UK. J.D. Vance, a Republican senator from Ohio, said the future of US foreign policy is a pivot to East Asia and \u201cEurope has to wake up to that fact.\u201d He also argued that the US doesn\u2019t produce sufficient munitions to support Ukraine and that \u201cwhat\u2019s reasonable to accomplish is some negotiated peace.\u201d Ricarda Lang, co-chair of Germany\u2019s Alliance 90/The Greens, gave a rebuttal, saying that Vladimir Putin has shown he doesn\u2019t want peace. Poland\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Radek Sikorski, and Ukraine\u2019s deputy prime minister, Olha Stefanishyna, both said issues between Poland and Ukraine over grain and trucking need to be resolved. Ayman Safadi, Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, said that \u201cwe should not be responsible for cleaning Israel\u2019s mess\u201d and that \u201cwe all cannot have peace\u201d unless Palestinians have a right to statehood. The Palestinian Authority\u2019s prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, said that \u201cwhat is immediately needed is a ceasefire and what is more needed is to allow international aid to get into Gaza.\u201d The EU\u2019s policy chief, Josep Borrell, said that when it comes to Israel and the Palestinians, \u201cif we want to play a geopolitical role in this issue, we have to be more united.\u201d Borrell also said \u201cthe West Bank is the real obstacle for the two-state solution.\u201d Finland\u2019s president-elect, Alexander Stubb, said that \u201cthis is our 1918, 1945, 1989 moment, of our generation.\u201d Angus Lapsley, Nato\u2019s assistant secretary general for defence policy and planning, summarised his impressions of this year\u2019s conference in Munich. \u201cFor me this year it was how allies and industry are coming to terms with scale/pace of change and investment needed to deliver collective defence. Our job at NATO is giving them the plan,\u201d he wrote. Christoph Heusgen, chairman of the Munich Security Conference, is closing the three-day event. \u201cWe started this conference on an extremely sad note, and this was the death of Alexei Navalny,\u201d he said, pointing to the speech of Alexei\u2019s wife, Yulia, at the conference. He added: I found the silver lining in the determination of the speech of the Ukrainian president, Mr. Zelenskyi. I find it in the strength of the many Ukrainians we have here, from civil society, from parliament. And I also find the strengthen in the determination of the \u2026 transatlantic community. Yes, there are challenges. But one of the features of this conference has always been that we have a congressional delegation, that we have Democrats and Republicans coming here, and I felt at least, that there is a dynamic \u2013 that our American partners, that the senators, that the members of the House of Representatives from both aisles, they will find a way very quickly how we can provide the support for the Ukrainian people that they deserve, that they need to defend our freedom. On the European side, Heusgen said he found \u201ca lot of satisfaction\u201d in what leaders said. However he added: \u201cwe cannot afford the luxury of waiting more to get the European defence organised.\u201d On the Middle East, the MSC chair said \u201cit was heartbreaking to see up here the photographs of the hostages\u201d and that \u201cit was horrible to hear a new figure of 17,000 orphans in Gaza.\u201d He added: Where is the silver lining? I found the silver lining in something that happened here that Munich stands for, peace through dialogue. I found a silver lining in a meeting that took place here between the president of Israel and the prime minister of Qatar. And I found a silver lining in president Herzog standing up here and thanking the prime minister of Qatar for what he is doing to try to come to a solution. This solution can only be a ceasefire, so that the hostages are freed and that the suffering of the people stops. He also said this year\u2019s conference looked at other conflicts and challenges, and that we have to open up. \u201cThis Munich conference has been the most diverse,\u201d he said. He finished the conference saying that Bayern Munich, which has lost two games in a row, is playing this afternoon \u201cand I hope there is a silver lining.\u201d Finland\u2019s president-elect, Alexander Stubb, said in Munich that \u201cthis is our 1918, 1945, 1989 moment, of our generation.\u201d He said: I think for the next ten years, we will live in an age of \u2018unpeace\u2019, where international rules and institutions will continue to be challenged, we will live in an age of unrest, where there will be a lot of conflicts popping up left and right. And I think the big \u2013 if not a battlefield, at least spheres of interest \u2013 is going to be between the global west, which tries to protect the current system, global east \u2013 China, Russia\u2013 which tries to challenge it, and the global south, which will have a big role in deciding in the way in which way it goes. Israeli diplomat Jonathan Rosenzweig has responded to Mohammad Shtayyeh\u2019s comments in Munich, criticising the Palestinian Authority. The Eurasia Group\u2019s Ian Bremmer said one of his takeaways from the Munich Security Conference is that \u201cIsrael has become much more internationally isolated.\u201d Just as leaders and ministers gathered in Munich discuss the situation in the Middle East, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has made an announcement. \u201cIn light of remarks that have been heard recently in the international community about an attempt to unilaterally force a Palestinian state on Israel, today I submit for government approval a declarative decision on the issue,\u201d he said. The proposed declaration states: Israel absolutely rejects international diktat regarding the permanent arrangement with the Palestinians. Such an arrangement will be achieved only by direct negotiations between the parties, without preconditions. Israel will continue to oppose unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. Such recognition, following the 7 October massacre, will award an immense and unprecedented prize to terrorism, and prevent any future peace agreement. Speaking in Munich earlier today, the Palestinian Authority\u2019s prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, stressed that \u201cwhat is immediately needed is a ceasefire and what is more needed is to allow international aid to get into Gaza, not only through one single entry, but through all the entries that are there.\u201d He also said he believes Egypt would not allow Palestinians to enter its territory. \u201cWe don\u2019t want Palestinians to move from Gaza into Egypt,\u201d Shtayyeh said. \u201cPeople should be allowed to go back to their homes,\u201d he added. The dynamics at this morning\u2019s panel underscored shifts in transatlantic dynamics. The EU\u2019s policy chief, Josep Borrell, said in a speech at the Munich Security Conference that \u201cthe question is, is there a political space for Europe to support a two-state solution?\u201d \u201cI think it is, but for that we need to be more united,\u201d he said, adding: If we want to play a geopolitical role in this issue, we have to be more united, as we have been in the case of Ukraine, where with maybe the exception of a single country, our unity has been remarkable. But here I see, that there is a dispersion of approaches, and many member states want to play own game. He also said: Without a clear prospect for the Palestinian people, [there] will not be peace in the Middle East, and the security of Israel will not be ensured just by military means. Speaking of the Middle East, Josep Borrell said: We need to promote a political solution. A comprehensive one, which includes not only Gaza but also the West Bank. Borrell said he is surprised everyone talks about ending the war in Gaza. \u201cYes, we have to end the war in Gaza. But, nobody has talked a lot about the West Bank. And the West Bank is the real obstacle for the two-state solution,\u201d he said. He added: The West Bank is boiling. The level of violence against the Palestinians has been increasing since the seventh of October. It was already very high before that. And if now UNRWA has to stop supporting the Palestinian people in the West Bank, we could be on the eve of a greater explosion. Speaking in Munich, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the most important geopolitical issues facing the EU today are related to Ukraine, Gaza and the global south \u2013 as well as defence. \u201cWe have to increase and provide Ukraine with security commitments,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe most important security commitment for Ukraine is membership\u201d of the EU. He also warned that \u201cwe have to consider different scenarios about how much engaged will US be on European security.\u201d Ayman Safadi, Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, said in Munich that \u201cwe should not be responsible for cleaning Israel\u2019s mess.\u201d He added: What we see in Gaza is a devastating war, mass murder, a destruction of the livelihood of 2 million people, pushing people to the abyss, destroying hospitals, killing journalists, killing medics, killing humanitarian workers. And we got to frame things in the right context: the root cause of all of this is occupation. Safadi also said: We\u2019re a country that made peace with Israel 30 years ago, but we made peace within the context of a broader peace that should allow for regional conditions that will ensure safety, security, dignity for all people, for Israelis and Palestinians. But Israel cannot have security unless Palestinians have security. We all cannot have peace unless the Palestinian people have their legitimate right to statehood and freedom and dignity fulfilled. This seems to have been pushed under tons of layers of ignorance and acting as if Palestinians do not exist. The Labour party\u2019s announcement that it will seek a security and defence agreement with the EU if elected to power later this year confirms what many expected. The UK left the EU without such a deal after Boris Johnson, the prime minister who delivered Brexit to the country, decided against informing the then EU negotiator Michel Barnier during trade negotiations that the EU would not be seeking such a deal. By that stage relations between the UK and the EU were poor and deteriorating. The UK wanted a clean-break Brexit and to \u201ctake back control\u201d of policing and remove the threat of a European army from its future. His decision was a complete U-turn on the \u201croad to Brexit\u201d that his predecessor Theresa May had mapped out in Munich in 2018 when she called for a new \u201cspecial partnership\u201d which she said would \u201cretain the co-operation that we have built and go further in meeting the evolving threats we face together\u201d. But the ongoing war in Ukraine has made the Labour position more palatable, even to a Conservative audience. In fact the current foreign secretary David Cameron, May\u2019s predecessor in Downing Street, will brief EU foreign ministers, by video, in Brussels on Monday on the UK\u2019s approach to the Middle East and the conflict in the Red Sea. Responding to the Polish foreign minister on stage, Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine\u2019s deputy prime minister, said: We have to solve it. There are legitimate messages on both sides. I think that the major contribution in resolving these issues has been done by Ukraine, because we secured the Black Sea. And now the grain is easily releasable through the Black Sea. We also have done our steps that we ensured the control of exports to neighbouring countries. So there are some steps done, but we have to solve it. Poland\u2019s Radek Sikorski stressed Poland\u2019s support for Ukraine but acknowledged that Warsaw and Kyiv have two problems linked to grain and trucking. This is difficult because it\u2019s structural. He added: We need to solve this so as not to cloud the overall picture of great Polish solidarity with Ukraine. And there is a solution on the horizon to both of them \u2013 which is Ukraine\u2019s victory in the Black Sea. The reason why the trucking is so vital is that Ukraine wasn\u2019t able to export its goods via the sea. And the same for grain. If we really and truly recover the control by Ukraine of western Black Sea, it will also help to address these issues. Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, said on a panel together with Georgia\u2019s president Salome Zourabichvili that \u201cit\u2019s very important\u201d that the country\u2019s former president Mikheil Saakashvili, who is now in jail, be \u201ctreated fairly and perhaps you could contribute to his release.\u201d \u201cThose who wish Georgia well would welcome it,\u201d he said. Responding to Republican senator J.D. Vance, German politician Ricarda Lang pushed back at the idea of a deal with Russia. Putin has shown over and over again \u2013 and he just showed this with the murder of Navalny on Friday \u2013 that he has no interest in peace at the moment. That he does not want peace. So if you say we stop supporting Ukraine, stop giving weapons to them, you are not having some scenario where this leads to peace, but at the moment this leads to two scenarios: either you are prolonging the war, or you give up Ukraine and Putin wins. J.D. Vance, the Republican senator from Ohio, said he believes Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want to abandon Europe, but \u201cis actually issuing a wake up call to say that Europe has to take a bigger role in its own security.\u201d He added: \u201cI do not think that Vladimir Putin is an existential threat to Europe, and to the extent that he is, again, that suggests that Europe has to take a more aggressive role in its own security.\u201d The senator said that \u201cgiven the realities\u201d his argument is that \u201cwhat\u2019s reasonable to accomplish is some negotiated peace.\u201d I think Russia has incentive to come to the table right now. I think Ukraine, Europe and the United States have incentive to come to the table. That is going to happen. This will end in a negotiated peace, the question is when it ends in negotiated peace, and what that looks like. The limiting factor for US support to Ukraine, the Republican senator J.D. Vance argued in Munich, is \u201cnot money, it\u2019s munitions.\u201d We don\u2019t make enough munitions to support a war in eastern Europe, a war in the Middle East and potentially contingency in East Asia. So the United States is fundamentally limited. Speaking on stage, J.D. Vance, a Republican senator from Ohio, said that \u201cDonald Trump was maybe the best president at deterring Russia in a generation.\u201d He added: On the question of European security: I think there\u2019s a fundamental issue here that Europe really has to wake up to. And I offer this in the spirit of friendship, not in the spirit of criticism. Because no, I don\u2019t think that we should pull out of Nato, and no, I don\u2019t think that we should abandon Europe. But yes, I think that we should pivot. The United States has to focus more on East Asia, that is going to be the future of American foreign policy for the next forty years. And Europe has to wake up to that fact. Asked how he sees his proposed security pact, David Lammy said: There are a number of issues. Procurement and joint and shared procurement, remains a significant challenge. And there does need to be complementarity across Europe. We should not be replicating in one country what another country can do. Clearly, our industrial capacity needs work. There is industrial capacity currently in the UK, with important companies like BAE Systems working there. Again, that will have to be a shared endeavour. And some of that endeavour, of course, will always continue to be transatlantic, working with our American partners. So I think that there are, in fact, significant areas, where we can work together. And going forward, just as we came together to determine the rules that should govern our global system after the Second World War, when we think about AI, when we think about quantum, when we think about advances in biotech, again, that takes shared endeavour. And we\u2019ll have to do that at speed. You know, sometimes, Europe can feel rather sluggish and bureaucratic. We will have to do that at speed. The urgency of war in Europe, I hope, reminds us of that fact. David Lammy, the British shadow foreign secretary, said on stage at the Munich Security Conference that he wants a new security pact between the EU and the UK. He said: Of course I\u2019m hoping that there is a general election this year and I have the privilege of becoming the UK foreign secretary, because it\u2019s absolutely fundamental that the United Kingdom and Europe have the closest of relationships and the Brexit era is over, the situation is settled. And what my party is proposing is a new EU-UK security pact. And it\u2019s a pact that is effectively built on the fact that we obviously have war here in Europe. But the truth is, and it\u2019s important that we summon up to the room the courage of Alexei Navalny \u2013 what it reminds is that not withstanding that war, Russia will continue to be a threat for Europe for months, years, perhaps a generation more. And that means that the defence capability of the UK, alongside our partners in France particularly representing about 50% of Europe\u2019s defence capability, but also the intelligence capability of the Five Eyes system in partnership with the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, is absolutely essential, and is why we need now a new security pact. Now, that security pact is not to rival Nato, it is to run in parallel with Nato. Ricarda Lang, co-chair of Germany\u2019s Alliance 90/The Greens, said at the Munich Security Conference that she grew up with the notion of the end of history but that this has changed dramatically over the past years. \u201cFor us, as Europe, this is the question: how can we strengthen our democracy?\u201d she said. Internally, Europe needs to come closer together, she said. In terms of security, the question of how to support Ukraine \u201cis of the utmost importance,\u201d she stressed. The question of whether democracies prevail is linked to whether Ukraine prevails, according to Lang. The first panel this morning has an interesting lineup: it includes J.D. Vance, a Republican senator from Ohio, Ricarda Lang, co-chair of the Alliance 90/The Greens in Germany, David Lammy, the British shadow foreign secretary, , and Priyanka Chaturvedi, deputy leader of the Shiv Sena party in India\u2019s parliament. Good morning and welcome back to a special edition of the Europe blog, coming to you from the Munich Security Conference. It\u2019s the third and last day of the conference, which for decades has brought together key policymakers from around the globe to Munich for debates on security. Questions over the future of western assistance to Ukraine, the war between Israel and Hamas, and the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny dominated discussions in the historic Hotel Bayerischer Hof. Today, discussions will continue, with speakers including Finland\u2019s president-elect Alexander Stubb, British shadow foreign secretary David Lammy and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. Stay tuned for updates."

            "title": "Human rights groups denounce failed Senate deal on border policies and foreign aid \u2013 as it happened",
            "date": "2024-02-07T22:55:23Z",
            "content": "We\u2019re wrapping up our live politics coverage for tonight. A recap of today\u2019s key events is below. Tomorrow, the supreme court will hear oral arguments on whether Donald Trump is eligible to run for office, a case that represents the culmination of years of work by left-leaning watchdog groups who argue that Trump\u2019s conduct on 6 January amounts to insurrection against the US government, and should bar him from holding office. From today: Senate Republicans rejected a bipartisan compromise bill that combined changes in US immigration policy and additional security measures at the US-Mexico border with nearly $100bn in foreign aid, including to Ukraine and Israel. The Biden-backed bipartisan compromise had been denounced by immigrant rights and human rights groups like Amnesty International, who called the proposals cruel, inhumane, and likely to lead to more suffering and death. Congressional Republicans faced criticism, including from their own members, for internal dysfunction after the failure of the bipartisan border compromise bill followed the flopped House GOP attempt to impeach Democratic homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Democrats are now using the GOP votes against a border deal to campaign against Republicans, arguing that party members caved to Trump, who had publicly urged them not to pass the deal. \u201cYou do not let a fire burn so that Donald Trump can campaign on the ashes,\u201d Democratic senator Patty Murray said. The Senate planned to move ahead with votes to advance a simpler bill that would simply provide foreign military aid to Ukraine and Israel, a measure that Biden said he would support. But as Republicans negotiated over whether they could add back in some border policy measures to the foreign aid bill, and the clocked ticked later into evening, forward movement stalled. But independent Sen. Bernie Sanders had already said earlier he would oppose legislation to provide military aid to Israel: \u201cIsrael has the right to defend itself against Hamas\u2019s terrorism, but it does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people,\u201d Sanders said, saying \u201cover 27,000 Palestinians have been killed and 67,000 wounded \u2013 two-thirds of whom are women and children\u201d since the war began. Still waiting\u2026. It is now nearly 5:30pm in Washington. The failed bipartisan compromise bill that paired US \u201cborder security\u201d provisions with billions in military aid for Ukraine and Israel had been sharply criticized by advocacy groups that support immigrant rights and human rights. \u201cImmigrants are essential members of our communities who move the country forward. Throwing immigrants under the bus in exchange for short-term, unrelated foreign aid is an enormous political and moral miscalculation,\u201d Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center and the NILC Immigrant Justice Fund, said in a statement in response to the bill\u2019s failure. Matos criticized Democrats for making a bipartisan deal with Republicans on border policy, arguing \u201cIt has long been clear that Republicans in Congress were never serious about resolving the issues in our immigration system and are only interested in weaponizing fear to score political points.\u201d Amnesty International had also denounced the now-failed bipartisan compromise, saying it included \u201cthe most extreme anti-immigrant proposals this country has seen in 100 years\u201d and that the policies were \u201cdraconian and antithetical to human rights\u201d and \u201cwill only lead to more suffering, more cruelty, and more death.\u201d Amnesty also criticized US senate support for \u201cbillions of dollars in unconditional military and security funding\u201d to Israel \u201cat a moment when there\u2019s concern about atrocities, including war crimes.\u201d Frustration as GOP rejects a bipartisan border compromise, only to demand another If you\u2019re just catching up on today\u2019s senate Republican vote to reject a bipartisan border deal, followed by GOP demands that amendments with border provisions be allowed for a standalone foreign military aid bill, here are some perspectives: And from a bit earlier: This is Lois Beckett, picking up our live politics coverage from Los Angeles. We are still waiting on a vote to see whether the senate will proceed with debate over a proposed $95b military assistance bill for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan. Some details on the current conversations among Republican senators from Punchbowl News and HuffPost: The focus will shift to the US supreme court tomorrow, where justices will consider a case challenging Donald Trump\u2019s ability to appear on presidential ballots, after advocacy groups argued his involvement in the January 6 insurrection should disqualify him. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Rachel Leingang with more on those efforts: A US supreme court case that could remove Donald Trump from the 2024 presidential ballot is the culmination of several years of work by left-leaning watchdog groups to reinvigorate the 14th amendment and its power. A Colorado case that found Trump couldn\u2019t run for re-election there was filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), though other groups and individuals have filed lawsuits and petitions in many states trying to remove Trump under the 14th amendment\u2019s third clause. The clause says that people who were in office and participated in an insurrection against the US can\u2019t hold office again. Some of the challenges have gone through the courts, while others have appealed directly to elections officials in charge of placing candidates on the ballot. Colorado was the first ruling to decide against Trump, so it is headed to the supreme court at the former president\u2019s behest. Because of how consequential and rare the issue is, it was expected that the high court would eventually be the arbiter of how the clause applied in the modern era. The Senate is now voting on whether to begin debate on the $95b military assistance bill for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan. That vote needs only a simple majority to succeed, but the story doesn\u2019t end there. Fox News reports that Democrats want the measure to pass quickly, but, as with most legislation in the Senate, will need at least nine Republican votes to do that. The GOP is demanding that majority leader Chuck Schumer allow amendments be made to the bill \u2013 including some measures dealing with immigration, even after the party just a few minutes ago voted down a bill to make major changes to how the US deals with migrants and asylum seekers: As we wait to find out if Republicans will vote to provide military aid to Ukraine and Israel without hardline border policies, Punchbowl News reports that a key GOP lawmaker is warning that approving the bill could hurt the party\u2019s chances in the November elections. That\u2019s the argument made in a party strategy meeting by senator Steve Daines of Montana, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is tasked with winning the party seats in Congress\u2019s upper chamber: Republicans are tipped to retake control of the Senate in November. For Democrats to maintain their one-seat majority, Joe Biden would have to win re-election, and the party would have to win two of the three seats they are defending representing Ohio, West Virginia and Montana \u2013 all red states. That\u2019s assuming their lawmakers in safer seats are re-elected, and the Democrats fail to defeat Republican senators representing Texas, Florida, or any other red state. The bipartisan bill combining an overhaul of US immigration policy and security measures at the US-Mexico border with nearly $100bn in foreign aid on Wednesday has failed to garner enough votes to move forward in the US Senate, although voting continued. More details as they happen. There are already 49 No votes. Sixty Yes votes in the 100-strong chamber are needed to pass bills. The White House is focused on getting a Ukraine aid package through the US Congress, the White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Wednesday, adding there was no \u201cplan B\u201d, Reuters reports. We believe we still can and will deliver aid for Ukraine,\u201d Sullivan told reporters during a joint press conference with the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. Stoltenberg said it was vital Congress agreed on continued support for Ukraine in the near future. Stoltenberg said there was no imminent threat to any Nato ally, but added: We must sustain our support and that is a responsibility for all allies.\u201d The US Senate is currently voting on the bipartisan border and foreign aid bill that a group of lawmakers has been working on for months and unveiled on Sunday. But the bill appears doomed, despite Republicans having insisted on immigration reform to tighten security at the US-Mexico border. Legislation needs 60 votes to pass the 100-member Senate, where Democrats hold a wafter-thin majority, so GOP support is needed to pass bills. Arizona independent US senator Kyrsten Sinema just told the chamber that the Republican abandonment of efforts to pass immigration reform legislation was \u201cshameful\u201d. Sinema (who switched from the Democratic party to become an independent not long after the midterm elections in 2022, when Republicans won control of the House), said that many Republican senators may just want to ignore a bill involving tightening border security, but Arizona could not afford that as it is dealing with the increase in migration every day. Republican senator James Lankford of Oklahoma spoke on the floor of the Senate moments ago to say that Americans were telling Congress to \u201cdo something\u201d about the increase in migration at the US-Mexico border. \u201cWe have to decide if we are going to do that or not, if we are going to do nothing, or do something,\u201d he said. He said the bill that looks doomed is \u201ca bill put together by a bipartisan effort \u2013 welcome to the US Senate\u201d. Lankford worked across the aisle with Democrats Patty Murray and Chris Murphy and independent senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona to prepare the complex bill that implements immigration reforms, toughens the US-Mexico border, and funds more aid for Ukraine, Israel and allies in the Indo-Pacific region such as Taiwan. At almost 400 pages, he said it took months of complicated work. But he said he had Republican colleagues who believed lies they read on social media rather than the text of the bill itself. One unnamed fellow GOPer told him: \u201cIf you are trying to move a bill that solves the border crisis during the election, I will do everything to destroy you,\u201d Lankford said. And they have done so, he said, by signaling they would not support a bill Republicans had said was sorely needed. Washington state\u2019s Democratic senator Patty Murray is on the floor of the US Senate now, lambasting Republicans who are obstructing the border and war aid spending legislation, and thanking her Republican fellow senator, James Lankford, of Oklahoma, who just spoke passionately. Murray talked of Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine and Israel\u2019s offensive against Hamas, and the need for more US funds for those allies, and said: \u201cToday is a critical vote. Today is a critical day to decide.\u201d She asked if senators would keep their word when they negotiate with each other. Both she and Lankford are lamenting the fact that legislation in front of the Senate to implement border reforms and boost funds for Ukraine and Israel is on the brink. \u201cAnd lets not forget there is the [US-Mexico] border,\u201d she said. \u201cThe site of so many Republican photo ops.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the moment we are in, by voting it down, Republicans will be telling our allies our word cannot be trusted, telling dictators like Putin that our threats are not serious,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd telling the American people they do not want to solve the crisis at the border, they want to campaign on it \u2013 you do not let a fire burn so that Donald Trump can campaign on the ashes,\u201d Murray said. Hours after the House descended into farce yesterday evening when Republicans failed to impeach the homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, and blocked legislation to send military aid to Israel, the Senate is taking a crack at approving a complex bill to tighten immigration policy while assisting both Israel and Ukraine. If that legislation does not pass, and there\u2019s plenty of reason to believe it will not, since Republicans say they no longer like the border security changes, the Senate\u2019s Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said they\u2019ll vote on a bill that solely contains funds for Kyiv, and for the counterattack against Hamas. Will that attract the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate, and, if it does, will it make through the House, where Ukraine foes are plenty? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. Here\u2019s what else is going on today: Joe Biden says he will support the Israel-Ukraine aid bill, even if it does not include immigration policy changes. The Mayorkas impeachment will die in the Senate, predicted Oklahoma\u2019s Republican senator James Lankford, who negotiated the ill-fated immigration policy bill. Nikki Haley had a terrible night in Nevada, where she came in second in the primaries to \u201cnone of these candidates\u201d. This morning, she blamed the Republican party\u2019s problems on Donald Trump, who appears on course to win its presidential nomination. The big question looming over the Senate is: will either version of the Israel-Ukraine aid bill, one of which contains immigration policy changes, the other which does not, receive enough votes to pass? To succeed, either legislation will need to receive 60 votes, meaning at least some Republicans will have to sign on. Punchbowl News reports that John Thune, the number-two Republican in the Senate, was mum about how his lawmakers were feeling: Independent senator Bernie Sanders says he will oppose the legislation to provide military aid to Israel, citing the widespread destruction and civilian casualties caused by its invasion of Gaza. \u201cIsrael has the right to defend itself against Hamas\u2019s terrorism, but it does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people. Since this war began over 27,000 Palestinians have been killed and 67,000 wounded \u2013 two-thirds of whom are women and children. Over 1.7 million people have been driven from their homes and have no idea as to where they will be in the future. Almost 70% of the housing units in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged,\u201d the Vermont lawmaker said. \u201cThis bill provides $10bn dollars more in US military aid for the Netanyahu government to continue its horrific war against the Palestinian people. That is unconscionable. That is why I will be voting NO.\u201d Joe Biden will sign legislation to send new military aid to Ukraine and Israel, even if it does not contain policy changes intended to stop migrants from crossing the southern border, the White House announced. Here\u2019s what spokesman Andrew Bates had to say: We support this bill which would protect America\u2019s national security interests by stopping Putin\u2019s onslaught in Ukraine before he turns to other countries, helping Israel defend itself against Hamas terrorists and delivering live-saving humanitarian aid to innocent Palestinian civilians. Even if some congressional Republicans\u2019 commitment to border security hinges on politics, President Biden\u2019s does not. We must still have reforms and more resources to secure the border. These priorities all have strong bipartisan support across the country. Whether the Senate manages to pass any legislation today is a different matter. The Senate will this afternoon take two votes on approving aid to Israel and Ukraine, one on a bill that will include hardline immigration policies, and one without, the chamber\u2019s Democratic leader Chuck Schumer announced. \u201cI have scheduled a vote on the supplemental that includes strong bipartisan border reforms that Republicans have demanded for months,\u201d Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor. He went on: Now, if Republicans blocked this national security package with border legislation that they demanded later today, I will give them the opportunity to move forward with the package without border reforms. This package will otherwise be largely the same. It will have strong funding for Ukraine, funding for Israel, help for innocent civilians in Gaza and funding to the Indo Pacific. The legislation on the floor today is one of the most important security packages the Senate has considered in a very long time. So the onus is on Senate Republicans to finally take yes for an answer. Last year, Republicans blocked Senate passage of a bill to provide aid to Israel and Ukraine, demanding that the Democrats agree to pass a law to stem the flow of migrants across the US border with Mexico. But after Joe Biden and his allies announced their support this week for hardline policies intended to do that, the GOP said they were no longer interested \u2013 reportedly because Donald Trump pressured them to do so. It\u2019s unclear how Senate Republicans will vote today. In his speech, Schumer warned the party that they would be doing Trump\u2019s bidding and harming national security if they block both pieces of legislation. \u201cIt would be an embarrassment for our country, an absolute nightmare for the Republican party if they reject national security funding twice in one day. Today is the day for Republicans to do the right thing when it comes to our national security,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWhy are the Republicans doing all this? Why have they backed off on border when they know it\u2019s the right thing to do? Two words, Donald Trump.\u201d The House GOP may one day get its act together and impeach the homeland security chief, Alejandro Mayorkas. But the effort will almost certainly go no further than that. Two-thirds of the Senate would have to vote to convict him, and with Democrats in the majority, that margin appears impossible to obtain. Don\u2019t take it from us \u2013 take it from Oklahoma\u2019s Republican senator James Lankford, who said as much just now: One wonders if Lankford isn\u2019t feeling a little bit bitter at the moment. He spent weeks bargaining with Democrats on the immigration policy compromise that would have seen hardline policies put in place in exchange for aid to Ukraine and Israel being passed. But that deal was shot down by his fellow Republican lawmakers, aided by Donald Trump, almost as soon as it was announced, meaning all that negotiation was probably for nothing. In remarks to reporters in the Capitol, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, said Republicans will try impeaching homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas again, but did not say when that would happen: Last time was a setback, but democracy is messy. We live in a time of divided government. We have a razor-thin margin here and every vote counts. Sometimes, when you\u2019re counting votes, and people show up when they\u2019re not expected to be in the building, that changes the equation. But, listen, we have a duty and a responsibility to take care of this issue. We have to hold the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security accountable, and Mayorkas needs to be held accountable. The Biden administration needs to be held accountable, and we will pass those articles of impeachment. We\u2019ll do it on next round. Last night\u2019s defeat of the impeachment effort was an embarrassment for Johnson, who has only been in the speaker\u2019s job for about three months. Asked to respond to comments from a fellow House Republican that it was a mistake to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House, Johnson said: \u201cIt was a mess, what happened here, but we\u2019re cleaning it up.\u201d He was also noncommittal about how the House would react if the Democratic-led Senate approves a bill that would fund aid to Israel and Ukraine. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what the Senate does. We\u2019re allowing the process to play out and we\u2019ll handle it as it is sent over,\u201d he said. Fresh off her not-victory in the Nevada primaries, Nikki Haley is pinning the blame for the GOP\u2019s woes on Donald Trump: Trump\u2019s hand is indeed being felt in Congress, where he played a major role in torpedoing an immigration policy compromise Republicans had themselves demanded in exchange for their votes to approve new aid to Ukraine and Israel. Congress now appears to be deadlocked on the issue, after the House GOP tried and failed to pass a standalone bill for Israel yesterday. Haley, meanwhile, is expected to make what may be the last stand of her presidential campaign in South Carolina\u2019s primaries on 24 February. That Democrats wanted to see the impeachment of Alejandro Mayorkas torpedoed isn\u2019t much of a surprise. More notable are the defections of three Republicans who voted against the charges, dooming the effort. In the Wall Street Journal, Mike Gallagher, one of the trio, said he voted against the charges because they would \u201cpry open the Pandora\u2019s box of perpetual impeachment\u201d: Impeachment not only would fail to resolve Mr Biden\u2019s border crisis but would also set a dangerous new precedent that would be used against future Republican administrations. The first article of impeachment lays out in grueling detail Mr Mayorkas\u2019s manifest incompetence. But incompetence doesn\u2019t rise to the level of high crimes or misdemeanors. Proponents of impeachment concede the framers rejected the idea that policy disputes or \u2018maladministration\u2019 constitute grounds for impeachment. They argue instead that Mr Mayorkas\u2019s underenforcement goes beyond maladministration, even though it doesn\u2019t reach the level of a criminal offense. In an appearance on C-SPAN, Tom McClintock, who also rejected the charges, worried that impeaching Mayorkas would set a precedent that could backfire: Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House minority leader, took something of a victory lap this morning, after his party successfully mobilized to block the impeachment of the homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, with the help of three Republican defectors. Addressing the press, the New York congressman called on House Republicans to drop what he characterized as partisan stunts, such as the charges against Mayorkas, who faced no threat of being convicted by the Senate. Here\u2019s what Jeffries had to say: Nikki Haley\u2019s struggles are fueling a behind-closed-doors campaign by the Republican National Committee to get her to exit the race so it can collaborate with Donald Trump, the Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell reports: Top officials at the Republican National Committee want Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor, to drop out of the race for the GOP nomination so it can launch a joint fundraising committee with Donald Trump to bolster its finances, according to people familiar with the situation. The RNC last week reported $8m in cash to spend in its year-end filing, an amount less than half of what it had when Trump was running for the presidency in 2016 and below what it needs to stand up operations as it prepares to take on Joe Biden in the general election. The issue for the RNC has been the lack of direct revenue, with small-dollar donors seen to generally prefer to donate directly to the Trump campaign and larger, institutional donors who dislike Trump preferring to donate directly to challengers like Haley, the people said. While the RNC was slightly buoyed with a $12m haul in January, RNC leadership has discussed in recent weeks the need for Haley to exit the race so they can as soon as possible launch a joint fundraising committee with Trump, which would allow wealthy donors to write checks larger than $800,000. The RNC does not technically need Haley to drop out to do joint fundraising agreements \u2013 it partnered with Trump in 2016 before the former Ohio governor John Kasich dropped out \u2013 but, the thinking goes, if Haley were out, the RNC could pick up her large-dollar donors who want to support the party but not Trump directly. The Nevada primary did not go as planned for Nikki Haley, but it went just fine for Joe Biden, who handily won the state\u2019s Democratic primary with 89% of the vote, based on ballots counted so far. With the power of incumbency, the president is not expected to have any trouble winning the Democratic party\u2019s presidential nomination. On Saturday, he overwhelmingly won in South Carolina against his two challengers, Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson, and in January triumphed in New Hampshire, even though he did not campaign there. \u201cI want to thank the voters of Nevada for sending me and Kamala Harris to the White House four years ago, and for setting us one step further on that same path again tonight. We must organize, mobilize, and vote. Because one day, when we look back, we\u2019ll be able to say, when American democracy was a risk, we saved it \u2013 together,\u201d Biden said in a statement following his win in Nevada. House members weren\u2019t the only Republicans getting humiliated yesterday. As the Guardian\u2019s Maanvi Singh reports, Nikki Haley managed to lose Nevada\u2019s presidential primary to nobody: Nikki Haley suffered an embarrassing defeat in Nevada\u2019s Republican presidential primary contest, when she was beaten by the \u201cnone of these candidates\u201d option, despite Donald Trump\u2019s absence from the ballot. Joe Biden, meanwhile, secured another primary victory after his nearest challenger, Marianne Williamson, registered only in the low single digits. The AP called the results about two hours after polls closed on a soggy and subdued election day in Nevada. The \u201cnone of these candidates\u201d option beat Nikki Haley in the state\u2019s Republican presidential primary contest, the AP projected, an embarrassing result for the former UN ambassador who was the only major candidate on the ballot. The race is essentially meaningless in the nominating process, however, as the big event for Republicans is on Thursday, when the GOP will hold caucuses with Donald Trump on the ballot that will determine the actual delegates sent to the Republican national convention. Last night, House Republicans and their speaker, Mike Johnson, were humiliated when their attempt to impeach the homeland security chief, Alejandro Mayorkas, failed on the House floor. Here\u2019s the moment Johnson personally delivered the bad news: Those are Democrats you can hear cheering. Nonetheless, Johnson\u2019s spokesperson says the speaker will try again to bring charges against Mayorkas over his handling of migration at the southern border: But when? The reason Republicans lost last night is that all Democratic lawmakers showed up to vote, while three of the GOP\u2019s own members voted against impeachment. Republicans should be able to win a second vote once majority leader Steve Scalise returns from cancer treatment, but Politico reports he won\u2019t be back until next week, at the earliest. That creates the scenario of the impeachment effort\u2019s fate becoming entwined with the 13 February special election in New York\u2019s suburbs to fill the empty seat created after the House expelled fabulist George Santos. A victory by Republican Mazi Pilip could prove decisive to the success of a second impeachment vote \u2013 but if Democrat Tom Suozzi wins, Republicans could find that they once again don\u2019t have the votes to succeed. Good morning, US politics blog readers. What a fiasco yesterday was for Republicans in Congress. First, the GOP turned against a deal they had demanded to impose hardline immigration policies and provide military aid to Ukraine and Israel, reportedly because Donald Trump wants to campaign on the issue. It was an embarrassing defeat for Mitch McConnell, the top Senate Republican who supports both countries\u2019 causes. But whatever mortification he felt was eclipsed by the farce that occurred late in the day in the House of Representatives. The Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, barreled ahead with a floor vote on impeaching the homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, thinking it had the support to pass. Little did he know that it, in fact, did not, after Democrats united against it and three Republicans defected. But Johnson\u2019s bad night wasn\u2019t over yet. He teed up a vote on a standalone package to fund Israel\u2019s military, thinking he could sway the country\u2019s Democratic backers into voting for it. They did not take the bait, and that legislation also failed to pass. The House GOP has vowed to press on with the Mayorkas impeachment, bringing the measure back up as soon as today, though it remains unclear if they have the votes to actually do that. Meanwhile, the Senate\u2019s Democratic leader Chuck Schumer is going on the offensive, reportedly by planning a vote on military aid to Israel and Ukraine, without the border crackdown the GOP, at one point, pressed for. We\u2019ll see if that goes anywhere. Here\u2019s what else is happening today: Nikki Haley managed to come in second to \u201cnone of these candidates\u201d in Nevada\u2019s low-stakes presidential primary, raising further questions about the viability of her challenge to Trump for the Republican nomination. Matt Gaetz and Elise Stefanik, two big Trump fans in the House, plan to introduce a resolution saying that he did not engage in an insurrection. Trump yesterday was denied immunity by an appeals court for his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election. His campaign says he will appeal."

            "title": "Canadian conservatives divided over trans policy ",
            "date": "2024-02-14T13:06:22Z",
            "content": "At the end of January, Danielle Smith, the premier of Alberta, announced a list of policy changes targeting transgender youth in the Canadian province, including a ban on hormonal treatment, puberty blockers and gender-confirmation surgery for children 15 years old and younger. The move marked the most restrictive rules on gender confirmation in the country. A few days later, Doug Ford \u2013 the Conservative premier of Ontario, and one of the most influential politicians in Canada \u2013 was asked whether his government intended to follow Smith\u2019s policies. \u201cNo,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe have a lot here, and we\u2019re leaving everything alone.\u201d The two conservative leaders\u2019 contrasting views on care for transgender youth highlight the limits of a culture war apparently imported to Canada from the United States. The issue, which affects only a slim minority of youth across the country, has nonetheless sharply divided political leaders within the conservative movement, with some believing it is a losing political issue that puts them on the wrong side of public opinion. In a video posted to social media on 31 January, Smith announced a string of what she described as policy changes. She said top and bottom gender-confirmation surgeries would be banned for minors under age 17, although bottom surgery is already limited to adults. While top surgery is permitted in Alberta, reporting also suggests only eight youth received surgery for gender confirmation last year. Under the new proposal, hormone therapy will only be available to teens aged 16 and older, with permission from their parents, a physician and a psychologist, instead of at the onset of puberty. Parents will need to give permission before students 15 and under can use a name or pronoun at school other than the one given at birth, Smith said. Students will need to opt in to classes dealing with sexuality and gender, reversing previous policy under which parents could have their children opt out of sexual education classes. Transgender women would be banned from women\u2019s sports. In the days after the announcement, Smith told the media the changes were motivated by a \u201cconcern of what will happen\u201d, rather than any current issues facing her government. Smith\u2019s announcement prompted widespread criticism, both from the Alberta Medical Association, which called on the premier to \u201creconsider\u201d the proposed policies and to work with \u201cexperienced professionals\u201d and the Canadian Paediatric Society, which warned that the proposals \u201cwill lead to significant negative health outcomes, including increased risk of suicide and self-harm\u201d. \u201cIt has to be the most hateful piece of legislation that we\u2019ve seen in the LGBTQ community,\u201d said Jen Gilbert, a professor at the University of Toronto. \u201cThey seem to want to take a very small number of young people and turn them into political pawns. And not only does it hurt those young people, it sends a signal to all queer and trans kids that their identities are up for debate.\u201d Gilbert, who specializes in sex education, said Smith\u2019s proposed changes mirror the legislative activism of conservatives in the United States and the burgeoning \u201cparental rights movement\u201d. \u201cThese activists are networked with each other and they\u2019re sharing techniques, strategies about how to affect policy. This particular set of restrictions is very similar to what we\u2019ve seen proposed in the US,\u201d said Gilbert. \u201cAnd these policies that claim to be for the rights of parents clearly aren\u2019t: what about LGBTQ parents and the parents of queer and trans kids?\u201d Months before Alberta waded into the issue, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan \u2013 both led by conservative premiers \u2013 announced changes to pronoun policies in schools, the latter using the notwithstanding clause of Canada\u2019s constitution to block any legal challenges. But as a growing list of conservative politicians court a fixation on gender issues, Doug Ford has bucked the trend. \u201cOf course, we don\u2019t know where he\u2019s going to be six months from now. He\u2019s the king of the flip-flop,\u201d said Susan Gapka, a Toronto-based community organiser and transgender rights activist. \u201cBut he also cares a lot about public opinion. And so his recent stance \u2013 that he\u2019s not going to get involved in this \u2013 has given me a bit of hope. And hope is something we desperately need right now.\u201d Ford has resisted neat political categorisation amid the deep partisanship that has come to define modern Canadian politics. \u201cHe\u2019s rightwing, he believes in smaller government. But he\u2019s not as driven ideologically as other leaders in the province,\u201d said Nelson Wiseman, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto. \u201cHis background is in business, not politics.\u201d The Ontario premier also has a reputation as a leader willing to quickly retreat on major policy proposals if he senses a shift in public opinion against his government. \u201cThe proposals in Alberta would not stand up to court challenges and so Smith would need to invoke the notwithstanding clause to suspend the fundamental rights of trans people if she wants to pass these sorts of policies,\u201d said Gapka. \u201cI suspect Doug Ford sees this \u2013 and realizes it\u2019s something he wants to avoid.\u201d Other Ontario conservatives seem baffled by Smith\u2019s decision. One told the Toronto Star it was a \u201csolution in search of a problem\u201d. Wiseman said few people in Ontario \u2013 or even in Alberta \u2013 list gender confirmation for young people as a major voting concern: \u201cWhen you ask people in either province what are the issues, nobody mentions this. They talk about inflation, they talk about the environment. And so you\u2019re stupid wading into it.\u201d But Gapka says the Alberta policies have cast a dark cloud over the transgender community and renewed the need for national efforts to help those most affected by the proposed changes. \u201cI think about those young families in rural Alberta and how they must be feeling right now,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll fight for them. They can count on that. And we will overcome.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-27T05:00:12Z",
            "content": "Jeremy Hunt\u2019s financial planning is \u201cdubious\u201d and \u201clacks credibility\u201d and the chancellor should not announce tax cuts in next week\u2019s budget if he cannot lay out how he will fund them, an economic thinktank has said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) calculates that Hunt would need to find \u00a335bn of cuts from already threadbare public services if he plans to use a Whitehall spending freeze to pay for pre-election giveaways. A fresh round of austerity in unprotected departments would boost the chancellor\u2019s war chest for tax cuts, the independent tax and spending watchdog said, but an increase from an expected \u00a315bn of headroom to about \u00a350bn over the next five years would come at a high cost. The IFS called for vague pledges to reduce spending to be replaced with concrete plans on where savings could be achieved, given the likely hardship and difficulty of achieving further reductions. Its report said: \u201cThe economic case for tax cuts is weak. The public finances remain in a poor position.\u201d In his autumn statement last November, Hunt committed to an increase in Whitehall spending of about 1% above inflation, but pressure is growing from Tory backbenchers to lift voters\u2019 spirits on 6 March with a round of tax cuts and measures to boost growth. On Monday, Damian Green, the chair of the One Nation caucus of Tory MPs, said the best way to grow the economy was by \u201ccutting taxes and giving people the opportunity to buy their own homes\u201d. There is speculation Hunt may cut 1p off the basic rate of income tax or introduce a further cut to national insurance contributions, on top of the one announced in the autumn statement. Existing promises to boost the subsidy for childcare and protect spending on the NHS, international aid, schools and defence mean the brunt of any resulting austerity would fall on several unprotected Whitehall ministries, the IFS said, including the Home Office and the departments for justice, transport and higher education. Hunt is understood to be considering a reduction in the overall increase in Whitehall spending, bringing it down from 1% above inflation to 0.75% or even 0.5%. However, the IFS said it was possible a freeze in real terms could become the preferred option, which would hit services at a time when a rise in the population is increasing demand. \u201cThis would see unprotected day-to-day spending falling by 6.7% a year, and per capita spending on unprotected public services falling by 7.4% a year,\u201d the thinktank said. The director of the IFS, Paul Johnson, said Hunt would need to explain how council services that are already on their knees could survive further austerity. \u201cWe also have huge backlogs in the justice system, universities that are genuinely struggling after 10 years of frozen budgets, and a prison system that is full,\u201d he added. Hunt has told parliament he will bring down the UK\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio in the last year of a five-year forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). To coincide with the budget, the OBR will predict the likely tax receipts and spending by the government for the period between the financial years of 2024-25 and 2028-29. James Smith, an economist at the bank ING, said: \u201cThe savings earmarked so far are already very challenging and further savings appear unrealistic. Talk of tax cuts inevitably triggers memories of the 2022 mini budget crisis, where UK government borrowing costs rose precipitously following a package of unfunded measures designed to boost growth.\u201d While Smith said a repeat of the Liz Truss-era gyrations was unlikely, the uncertainty surrounding how Hunt would balance the government\u2019s books meant the UK was paying higher interest rates on its debt than was necessary. The IFS suggested that this year\u2019s budget deficit may be about \u00a311bn smaller than it was forecast to be in November, but still much higher than it was forecast to be in March 2022. The thinktank said the faster population growth projected by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) could boost revenues but also meant Treasury plans would see per-person spending rise by just 0.2% a year after the election. Taxes have increased steeply under successive Conservative administrations, bringing about the biggest tax-raising parliament in modern history. A report by the Resolution Foundation thinktank found that British households were on course to be worse off at the end of this parliamentary term, despite Hunt\u2019s \u00a320bn of tax cuts in his autumn statement. Martin Miklo\u0161, an economist at the IFS and one of the report\u2019s authors, said: \u201cIn November\u2019s autumn statement, the chancellor ignored the impacts of higher inflation on public service budgets and instead used additional tax revenues to fund eye-catching tax cuts. At next week\u2019s budget, he might be tempted to try a similar trick, this time banking the higher revenues that come from a larger population while ignoring the additional pressures that a larger population will place on the NHS, local government and other services. \u201cHe might even be tempted to cut back provisional spending plans for the next parliament further to create additional space for tax cuts. The chancellor should resist this temptation. Until the government is willing to provide more detail on its spending plans in a spending review, it should refrain from providing detail on tax cuts.\u201d A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cOur responsible action with the public finances meant we could cut taxes for working people and businesses in the autumn statement. We will not comment on speculation over whether further reductions in tax will be affordable in the budget. \u201cWe are on track to meet our fiscal rules, and total departmental spending will be \u00a385bn higher after inflation by 2028-29 than at the start of this parliament, including record funding for the NHS.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-16T11:09:56Z",
            "content": "NatWest made its biggest annual profit last year since the 2007 financial crisis, helped by high interest rates, as the bank confirmed the interim boss, Paul Thwaite, would permanently take over as its chief executive before a public sale of its government-owned shares. The UK lender \u2013 which is still 35% government-owned \u2013 said pre-tax profits rose 20% to \u00a36.2bn in the year to December. That is higher than analyst forecasts for \u00a36bn, and marks its largest annual profit recorded since it made \u00a310bn in 2007, the year before excesses led to a \u00a345.5bn public rescue that has yet to be fully unwound 16 years later. Bumper profits in 2023 came as the bank made more money from loans and mortgages, compared with what it paid to savers, after another year of interest rate increases by the Bank of England. Those earnings, known as net interest income, rose 12% to \u00a311bn. It sent NatWest shares up more than 5%, making it the biggest riser on the FTSE 100. The bank\u2019s bonus pool for bankers fell 3% to \u00a3356m despite the jump in profits. NatWest said this reflected the impact on shareholders, after the bank missed previous earnings guidance. Shareholders will receive a \u00a31bn payout, with a final dividend worth 11.5p a share, and have a chance to take part in a \u00a3300m share buyback programme. The earnings results will set a high benchmark for Thwaite, who NatWest confirmed on Friday would take over permanently as chief executive with immediate effect, running the bank alongside the incoming chair, Rick Haythornthwaite. Thwaite was paid \u00a31.7m pay package for the year, including a \u00a3245,000 cash bonus, and other benefits such as \u00a321,000 for business travel and \u00a31,700 for home security. Thwaite, who previously ran NatWest\u2019s business banking division, took over as the interim chief executive in July after his predecessor, Alison Rose, was forced to quit over a debanking row with Nigel Farage. Thwaite\u2019s appointment will help pave the way for government plans to sell shares in NatWest to the general public later this year, after the state agency that manages the taxpayer stake said the market needed reassurance on NatWest\u2019s leadership before going ahead. The debanking controversy started when Coutts \u2013 the NatWest-owned private bank for the ultra-wealthy \u2013 planned to shut Farage\u2019s bank accounts, and snowballed after Farage obtained internal documents that showed the bank had concerns over his political views. The scandal escalated when it emerged that Rose had discussed Farage\u2019s case with a BBC journalist. Rose was forced to forgo \u00a37.6m in pay from NatWest, although independent lawyers hired by the bank concluded she had made an \u201can honest mistake\u201d in speaking with the BBC and that concerns over Farage\u2019s political views were not the driving factor in the decision to shut his accounts. While the jump in earnings will be a relief after a tumultuous year, there are signs that profit growth could slow. NatWest warned that total income was expected to drop to \u00a313bn-\u00a313.5bn in 2024, from \u00a314.8bn this year, adding: \u201cThe economic outlook remains uncertain.\u201d The bank\u2019s forecasts point to a drop in inflation to 2.5% by the end of 2024 \u2013 from 4% now \u2013 leading to a cut in interest rates to 4% from current levels of 5.25%, which could put pressure on net interest income. Thwaite said the encouraging news on inflation was also being offset by other factors, including the government\u2019s removal of energy bill support and the fact that millions of homeowners were still set to roll off fixed mortgage terms on to higher rates. That bank had seen customers try to \u201ctake more control of their spending\u201d and were supplementing their income, including through cashback sites and secondhand shops online. However, Thwaite said the bank was going into 2024 \u201cfocused on the things we can control; delivering profitable growth, becoming more efficient, more productive, and simpler to deal with, while managing our cost and capital efficiently. Together, these actions will drive long-term, sustainable value for our customers, shareholders, and the wider UK economy.\u201d"

The US House of Representatives on Tuesday impeached Alejandro Mayorkas, Joe Biden\u2019s secretary of homeland security, on explicitly political charges related to conditions at the southern border.

The tight 214-213 vote comes amid an unprecedented situation at the US-Mexico border: there has been a surge in the number of encounters, with arrivals coming in record numbers despite more perilous journeys. Last week, Republicans in the Senate sank an immigration and border deal \u2013 proposed after extensive negotiations with Democrats \u2013 after Donald Trump, the likely Republican presidential nominee, made his opposition clear.

            "title": "China offers to deepen security ties with Hungary",
            "date": "2024-02-19T11:11:55Z",
            "content": "China has offered to deepen security cooperation with Hungary, underscoring Budapest\u2019s warming ties with Beijing just as Hungarian officials snubbed a visiting delegation from Washington. Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, met China\u2019s minister of public security, Wang Xiaohong, on Friday. In comments published by China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency over the weekend, Wang said he was hoping to \u201cdeepen cooperation in areas including counter-terrorism, combating transnational crimes, security and law enforcement capacity building under the belt and road initiative\u201d. The aim, according to the Chinese minister, would be \u201cto make law enforcement and security cooperation a new highlight of bilateral relations\u201d. Hungary is a member of the EU and Nato, making China\u2019s offer highly unusual. Budapest, which also maintains closer links to Moscow than any other EU member, has been nurturing a relationship with Beijing. Last year, Orb\u00e1n was the only EU leader to attend a forum of the belt and road initiative in Beijing. China\u2019s electrical vehicle manufacturer BYD has said it will open its first European production factory in Hungary. In a statement about Friday\u2019s meeting with Wang, a spokesperson for Orb\u00e1n said the prime minister had declared that \u201crespect is increasingly missing from international diplomacy, but it has always remained between Hungary and China\u201d. \u201cThe negotiating parties drew attention to the importance of security and stability,\u201d the spokesperson said. The prospect of greater security cooperation between Budapest and Beijing comes at a time when Hungary\u2019s relationship with its EU and Nato allies is at a low point. While Hungary\u2019s standing in western capitals has been deteriorating for years, Budapest\u2019s decision to renege on a promise not to be the last to ratify Sweden\u2019s Nato application has further undermined trust. Budapest\u2019s isolation was demonstrated over the weekend at the Munich security conference, from which senior Hungarian officials were absent. However, in a speech in Hungary on Saturday, Orb\u00e1n signalled a shift, announcing that \u201cwe are on course to ratify Sweden\u2019s accession to Nato at the beginning of parliament\u2019s spring session\u201d. The continued strain was on full display over the weekend, as Hungarian officials refused to meet visitors from Washington. \u201cAllies have been awaiting Hungary\u2019s action on Sweden\u2019s accession to Nato for 21 months,\u201d the US ambassador in Budapest, David Pressman, wrote on social media. \u201cRegrettably, a range of senior Hungarian government officials and Fidesz parliamentary representatives declined to meet with the most senior US bipartisan congressional delegation to visit Hungary in years,\u201d he added. In his weekend speech, Orb\u00e1n \u2013 who is facing domestic political pressure and protests amid a scandal that led to the resignation of the country\u2019s president \u2013 made his preferences clear. \u201cWe cannot interfere in other countries\u2019 elections, but we would very much like to see President Donald Trump return to the White House and make peace here in the eastern half of Europe.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-01T13:06:03Z",
            "content": "You\u2019re reading the Guardian US\u2019s free Trump on Trial newsletter. To get the latest court developments delivered to your inbox, sign up here. On the docket: follow the money The $83.3m in damages that Donald Trump was ordered to pay for defaming E Jean Carroll may soon seem like chump change. In the New York civil business fraud trial, where a verdict is expected any day, the penalty could reach hundreds of millions of dollars, drain the former president\u2019s liquid assets, and hamper him from making more money by dismantling his businesses. \u201cThe documents here clearly contain fraudulent valuations that defendants used in business,\u201d Judge Arthur Engoron wrote back in September, ruling that the Trump Organization, Trump and his sons Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump, who are also executives, committed fraud by lying for years about the value of various assets of their company to inflate its value and get better terms on bank loans and insurance. The only question now is what Engoron will assess as punishment. The New York attorney general, Letitia James, who prosecuted the case, has asked for $370m in penalties as well as barring Trump from ever running a company that does business in New York state again and preventing him from buying real estate or taking out a loan in the state for the next five years. A verdict is expected any day. During a hearing in November, the judge said he was aiming to issue a decision by the end of January, though he did not set himself a firm deadline. Whatever he decides on, the financial penalty will probably be steep, even for someone like Trump, who Forbes estimates is worth about $2.6bn and has roughly $426m in liquid assets. If Trump is barred from doing business in New York state \u2013 or, in one of the most extreme and least likely punishments Engoron could hand down, his companies are liquidated \u2013 that could potentially force the sale of some of the iconic New York properties he built his business reputation on, like the Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan which contains its three-floor penthouse that was his longtime home before he switched residency to Florida in 2019. New York\u2019s anti-fraud statute leaves Engoron \u201can awful lot of wiggle room\u201d in his decision, perhaps an uncomfortable amount, Columbia University law professor Eric Talley said. \u201cThere\u2019s just not a big track record for companies of this size that are at this stage for this kind of proceeding involving this particular statute,\u201d he said. Talley suspects Engoron is aiming for a \u201cGoldilocks-ian sweet spot between having a completely toothless and limp order that basically does nothing\u201d and what would amount to a \u201ccorporate death penalty\u201d. Briefs \u25cf Nathan Wade, a special prosecutor on Trump\u2019s Georgia Rico trial, settled his divorce case on Tuesday. After allegations that he and the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, are in a romantic relationship, records obtained in the divorce proceedings showed that he had twice purchased airline tickets for himself and Willis. The settlement means that neither has to testify under oath, in a hearing that was scheduled for Wednesday, after being subpoenaed by Wade\u2019s estranged wife. But this isn\u2019t over. Michael Roman, a former Trump campaign official and one of the former president\u2019s codefendants, is seeking to have both Wade and Willis removed from the case and the entire district attorney\u2019s office disqualified, with the claim that their alleged relationship is a conflict of interest. Trump filed his own motion last Thursday to do the same. Both Willis and Wade have received subpoenas to appear in court on 15 February for a hearing on the motion. \u25cf On Monday, Georgia state lawmakers passed a bill that would create a panel with the power to remove elected prosecutors from office, potentially giving them a way to boot Willis from office and end her prosecution of Trump. \u25cf In the Florida national security documents criminal case, Judge Aileen Cannon was set to meet in closed chambers with special counsel Jack Smith and prosecutors on Wednesday in order to, as Cannon\u2019s order put it, \u201cassist with the court\u2019s evaluation\u201d of Trump\u2019s requests for access to the classified materials. The order also specified that Trump\u2019s lawyers not be present and that the meeting takes place in a \u201cfacility suitable for the discussion of classified information\u201d. \u25cf Illinois became the latest state basically pleading for the US supreme court to make a decision on whether the 14th amendment requires removing Trump from the presidential ballot for violating the US constitution by committing insurrection. The state board of elections decided unanimously on Tuesday that it didn\u2019t have the power to decide the issue, setting up further legal battles. State officials in Colorado and Maine have ruled that he should be removed, while multiple other states have ruled the opposite. Cronies and casualties Former Trump campaign attorney (and Georgia plea-bargainer) Sidney Powell allegedly received a spreadsheet claiming to contain private passwords of employees for the voting technology company Smartmatic from Marshall Herring, president of the far-right TV network One America News, according to new legal filings from Smartmatic\u2019s lawyers obtained by CNN. Smartmatic is suing OAN for defamation, and in legal filings, says the evidence suggests OAN executives \u201cmay have engaged in criminal activities\u201d because they \u201cappear to have violated state and federal laws regarding data privacy\u201d. Peter Navarro, a close Trump ally and former administration official, was sentenced to four months in prison last Thursday. He had been found guilty of criminal contempt of Congress last fall for ignoring a subpoena from the House January 6 committee. What\u2019s next Any day We\u2019re expecting the verdict on the punishment in the New York business fraud case imminently. Friday That\u2019s the deadline for Willis to respond in writing to a motion arguing she should be removed from the Georgia case because of an alleged romantic relationship with another prosecutor. 8 February The US supreme court has set oral arguments on whether the 14th amendment of the US constitution bans Trump from running for federal office. The clause disqualifies former officials who previously took an oath to uphold the constitution and then \u201cengaged in insurrection or rebellion\u201d against the US. At issue is a Colorado state election officials ruling that the amendment applies to Trump and would remove him from the presidential ballot in that state. 12 and 13 February Hearings on motions on how to protect the classified information at the heart of the Florida documents case. 15 February Fulton county Judge Scott McAfee has scheduled a hearing on the motion to disqualify Willis and Wade from the Georgia prosecution. Calendar crunch Court gazers have begun wondering what\u2019s holding up the DC circuit court of appeals from making a ruling on Trump\u2019s claim that presidents are immune from criminal prosecution, which has put the brakes on special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election interference case. It\u2019s been more than seven weeks since Judge Tanya Chutkan paused the countdown to a 4 March trial date so appellate judges could rule. The three-judge panel hearing the appeal seemed skeptical of Trump\u2019s claims when they heard arguments back on 8 January, and were expected to rule quickly. But three weeks later, they have yet to issue a decision. There is no time limit for judges, and it would only take one judge on the panel to delay things. Two of the judges were appointed by President Joe Biden, and one, Judge Karen Henderson, was appointed by George HW Bush. Henderson opposed expediting the case on a previous motion, though during oral arguments, she expressed skepticism of Trump\u2019s view. \u201cI think it is paradoxical to say that his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed allows him to violate criminal law,\u201d she said from the bench. The panel\u2019s decision is only the first step for Trump\u2019s presidential immunity gambit. Whoever the appeals panel rules against can (and most likely will) appeal to a hearing by the entire circuit court and then to \u2013 where this matter will almost undoubtedly eventually land \u2013 the US supreme court. All the while, the entire election interference trial timeline is on pause, and the longer this drags on, the less likely a trial will happen before the 2024 election \u2013 or at all."

Thousands of AT&amp;T customers reported service disruptions that rendered them unable to send texts, access the internet or make calls, even to emergency services via 911. More than 50,000 incidents were reported at about 7am ET, according to data from the outage tracking website Downdetector.com. Outage reports spiked above 70,000 around 9am ET. By 11am ET, reports of service failures had decreased to 60,000. Just after noon, AT&amp;T said in a statement it had restored 75% of its network. Around 4pm ET, the company said it had \u201crestored wireless service to all our affected customers\u201d. \u201cWe sincerely apologize to them,\u201d the company\u2019s statement reads.

We are working urgently to restore service to them. We encourage the use of wifi calling until service is restored.\u201d AT&amp;T, the largest cellular service provider in the US, with 240 million subscribers, has not offered a detailed explanation for the outage but said in a statement that it did not believe it was due to a cyber attack. \u201cBased on our initial review, we believe that today\u2019s outage was caused by the application and execution of an incorrect process used as we were expanding our network,\u201d the company said in a statement. Intermittent outages have hit AT&amp;T networks in recent days, but the scale of Thursday\u2019s outage was much larger. Cities where most users were affected included San Francisco, Houston, Atlanta and Chicago, the website showed. Federal law enforcement agencies in the US were investigating whether a technical malfunction or a cyberattack could have caused the outage, ABC News reported. According to a memo from the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s digital threats division, Cisa, \u201cthe cause of the outage is unknown and there are no indications of malicious activity.\u201d Users of Verizon, T-Mobile, Cricket and UScellular also reported disruptions, though the outage with the services was much smaller than AT&amp;T, according to Downdetector. Verizon and T-Mobile tweeted that the outage had not affected their own customers except when attempting to reach customers of another carrier. T-Mobile said in a statement: \u201cWe did not experience an outage.\u201d Verizon\u2019s statement read: \u201cVerizon\u2019s network is operating normally.\u201d AT&amp;T operates a network for first responders and emergency services, FirstNet, which went out alongside the company\u2019s general cell network, but AT&amp;T said FirstNet was back online by 10.30 am US eastern time. A post on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, from the San Francisco fire department said the outage was affecting people\u2019s ability to reach emergency services by dialing 911. \u201cWe are aware of an issue impacting AT&amp;T wireless customers from making and receiving any phone calls (including to 911),\u201d the fire department said, adding that it was \u201cactively engaged and monitoring this\u201d. Chicago\u2019s office of emergency management and communications issued a similar statement. Atlanta\u2019s mayor, Andre Dickens, said that calls to and from the city\u2019s emergency services were still functional: \u201cAtlanta\u2019s e-911 is able to receive inbound and make outbound calls. We have received calls from AT&amp;T customers that their cellular phones are in SOS mode.\u201d Massachusetts state police said the department\u2019s dispatch centers had been inundated with worried callers testing their phone service by dialing 911. The bureau advised against doing so. The department said via X: \u201cMany 911 centers in the state are getting flooded w/ calls from people trying to see if 911 works from their cell phone. Please do not do this. If you can successfully place a non-emergency call to another number via your cell service then your 911 service will also work.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-08T07:27:34Z",
            "content": "British defence intelligence officials say the UK is closer to a large-scale conflict than at any recent point, as the Middle East crisis intensifies while Russia pursues an expansionist agenda and China develops advanced weapons. One senior official said the secretive 4,500-strong unit was the busiest it had been in at least a decade, and said the fast turnover of ministers made it harder to ensure key politicians were making informed decisions. The official was asked if they agreed with Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, who said in a speech last month that the UK and the west was \u201cmoving from a postwar to a prewar world\u201d. The official, based in defence intelligence and speaking on condition of anonymity, cited Russia\u2019s continuing attack on Ukraine and the possibility of an expansion of the conflict, while adding that it remained possible China would attempt to take Taiwan by force. \u201cIs there a likelihood of a large-scale conflict? Yes, there is. It\u2019s probably more likely than it has been at any recent point,\u201d they said, reflecting a period of instability deepened by the Israel-Gaza war and US-led bombing campaigns against Houthi rebels in Yemen and Iranian-back militias in Iran and Syria. A particular challenge, they added, was dealing with \u201cthe turnover of decision makers\u201d during years of Conservative turmoil. Three prime ministers, four foreign secretaries and two defence secretaries have served since late 2019, the course of the current parliament. Senior officials and military leaders had a \u201cresponsibility to educate\u201d, the senior defence official argued, recognising that politicians often came to defence and foreign policy roles with little experience of international or military affairs. An exception is David Cameron, a former prime minister who was unexpectedly appointed last year by Rishi Sunak as foreign secretary. Shapps was given the job of defence secretary last September despite no experience of military affairs. Defence Intelligence is not a statutory spy agency like MI5, MI6 and GCHQ but nevertheless forms a key part of Britain\u2019s secret state, tasked with monitoring military threats, activity and conflict worldwide. Outside London, its principal operation is at RAF Wyton, in Cambridgeshire. Dozens of teams operate at the base, aggregated into a newsroom the size of a football pitch in a building called Pathfinder. Monitoring desks displaying maps, satellite imagery, drone footage or other feeds from conflict zones or other regions are arranged in honeycomb banks to allow for team working. The complex range of activities include using remote imagery to identifying potential Houthi missile and radar sites, which have been bombed three times by the US and UK since mid-January. Identical tools are used to conduct damage assessment and assess casualties from a distance. In keeping with Five Eyes practice, all raw intelligence is shared with the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and officials from all countries operate inside Pathfinder. Monitoring activities follow the sun, with the newsroom handing over to the US in the evening and picking up from New Zealand in the morning. One team, DI Watch, operates on a 24-hour basis, tasked with continually monitoring reports of violence or conflict. If thought necessary, a cross-government alert should be produced within 10 minutes and a slide with context and a graphic, similar to the US Discord leaks, distributed within an hour. An open source intelligence team relies on satellite imagery to monitor developments in military installations in Russia, China and elsewhere. Last month, some of its work was sent to a panel of UN experts showing satellite photos of North Korean cargo shipments to Russia, said to be weapons. Another group specialises in mapping locations using drones and lasers, and regularly assists British police. Its 3D visualisations help officers provide security for large events in the UK, while the drone team to helped discover footprints left by the killer of the Hull student Libby Squire as he dumped her body in a river. A capability assessments team monitors weapons developed by adversaries. Its recent work has included an examination of the DF-27, a Chinese hypersonic missile that emerged in 2022. It has a range of about 3,100 miles (5,000km) and can travel more than five times the speed of sound, making it difficult to shoot down soon after launch. A second defence official emphasised that Beijing was still considered the longer-term threat because of its size and technological capability, despite the series of current conflicts. They said there were \u201cstorms in the Middle East and a hurricane in Ukraine but China is climate change\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 February 2024 to replace an unsuitable image."

            "date": "2024-02-08T15:40:37Z",
            "content": "Time to wrap up. The chief of the CBI has said \u201clarge-scale\u201d tax cuts should be kept off the table as the country gears up for an election. Rain Newton-Smith told an audience in London that businesses \u201cwant stability so they can invest for the future\u201d, not tax cuts driven by short-termism. She insisted: To fund our public services with an ageing population, we must keep large-scale tax cuts off the table. Bank of England policymaker Catherine Mann has warned that inflation is \u201cthe most pernicious of taxes\u201d, as she explained why she wanted to raise interest rates last week. Mann warned of risks of \u201ccontinued inflation momentum and embedded persistence\u201d, adding that Red Sea disruption could also push up prices in the UK. China has the opposite problem, though \u2013 deflation. Its consumer prices index fell at the fastest pace in 15 years in January, pulled down by cheaper food. The outlook for the UK housing market has improved, surveyors say\u2026.. \u2026but more mortgage-holders have dropped into arrears in the last quarter. Shares in UK chip designer Arm has soared after it reported seeing higher royalty and licensing revenue amid strong AI demand. Here\u2019s the rest of today\u2019s news stories: Bank of England policymaker Catherine Mann is explaining that she voted to raise UK interest rates last week because of the need to fight the \u201cpernicious\u201d tax of inflation. In a speech to the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum this afternoon, Mann warns that there are risks of \u201ccontinued inflation momentum and embedded persistence\u201d, due to sluggish supply growth and the risk of \u201cupside shocks\u201d. Mann explains that the UK jobs market is \u201cstill relatively tight\u201d and is loosening only slowly. She also points out that financial conditions have eased substantially since September, as the markets have anticipated cuts to Bank Rate in the coming months. Mann says: Inflation is the most pernicious of taxes, affecting all households, and those at lower incomes most severely. Considering both backward-looking outcomes and my forward-looking assessments and risks, I determined it was prudent to vote for another increase in Bank Rate. It was a finely balanced decision. Mann was joined in her vote to raise interest rates to 5.5% by fellow policymaker Jonathan Haskel. Six of the nine committee members voted to hold rates, while one, Swati Dhingra, voted for a cut. Mann warns today that there is evidence of \u201cupward bias\u201d by firms when they set their prices, which would add to inflationary pressures. The Bank of England forecasts that inflation will fall to its 2% target this spring, down from 4% in December, before rising by the end of the year She also fears that Middle East turmoil could quickly push up prices in the UK: More immediately, upside risk to shipping and insurance costs associated with the Red Sea turmoil may affect near-term inflation outcomes and be magnified through firm-level price setting behaviors, which would augment persistence. I worry that such an upward inflation shock coming on the heels of the recent high inflation environment will be more swiftly incorporated into firms\u2019 costs and prices, exacerbating upside momentum, which is slow to dissipate when the inflation shock subsides. The value of UK chip designer ARM has surged by over a third at the start of Wall Street trading, after it beat revenue expectations last night. Investors have driven ARM\u2019s share price up by 36% to $105.14, after it lifted its outlook for this year, citing a recovery in the smartphone market and high demand for artificial intelligence technology. Arm is the biggest supplier of design elements for the processing chips used in products from smartphones to games consoles. It floated in New York last autum at an offer price of $51 each, so anyone who bought shares in the IPO have now doubled their money. The dollar has strengthened following today\u2019s drop in US jobless claims, knocking the pound down half a cent to $1.258. Over in the US, the number of people filing new claims for unemployment support have fallen. There were 218,000 fresh \u2018initial claims\u2019 for welfare support last week, a drop of 9,000 compared to the previous week. That suggests that US firms are continuing to hold onto staff, following a larger-than-expected rise in new jobs created in January. The boss of the Confederation of British Industry has urged politicians to keep \u201clarge-scale\u201d tax cuts off the table, and to focus on funding public services. Speaking at a conference in Westminster, CBI director general Rain Newton-Smith said that companies do not want to see tax reductions \u201cdriven by short-termism\u201d. Newton-Smith argued that for growth to be truly sustainable, it must prevent persistent high inflation. She says: Business investment is set to fall five per cent this year, in part because of higher interest rates needed to bring inflation down. As one business leader told me, they don\u2019t want to see tax cuts driven by short-termism which leads to higher interest rates. They want stability so they can invest for the future. To fund our public services with an ageing population, we must keep large-scale tax cuts off the table. Last week, the International Monetary Fund issued a strong warning to Jeremy Hunt against cutting taxes in his budget in March, stressing the need to boost key areas of public spending instead. Hunt had been hinting that the budget would include tax cuts. But following the IMF\u2019s intervention, he played down the prospect, saying there was less room for tax reductions than hoped. Newton-Smith also called for green investment to be increased from \u00a310bn to \u00a350bn per year by 2030, so the UK can hit its net zero target by 2050. She says: The majority will need to come from the private sector. But public sector investment in green technologies is essential as a catalyst to crowd that in. Whether that is de-risking Sustainable Aviation Fuels through contracts for difference, or helping our public buildings to move to low carbon heat and our social housing sector to insulate homes, lowering bills. Just look at the Port of Tyne, a fantastic CBI member I visited two weeks ago. Last year they secured \u00a3100m for their Tyne 2050 project \u2013 half catalytic public investment; half all-important private sector investment. But in the UK, overall public sector investment is too low and too volatile. The average OECD country invests nearly fifty per cent more. That\u2019s a timely intervention, with the Labour party expected to scale back its \u00a328bn green investment programme today\u2026. \u2026.a decision that has been criticised by environmentalists, progressive campaigners, and policy experts today: Newton-Smith was appointed the CBI\u2019s director last spring, after her predecessor Tony Danker was dismissed after the Guardian revealed unrelated complaints about his conduct in March. The CBI settled with Danker for an undisclosed sum this week and reiterated that his departure was unrelated to other allegations of misconduct at the group. Profits at motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson have dropped, as demand slows. Harley-Davidson has reported an operating loss of $21m for the last quarter of 2023, down from a profit of $4m in Q4 2022. Net income shrank 38% to $26m. Global motorcycle shipments fell by 7% to 179,984. Just in: US sportswear company Under Armour has raised its profit forecasts, as input costs ease. Under Armour also lifted its annual profit margin forecasts \u2013 it now expects annual gross margin growth of 120 to 130 basis points, compared to previous expectations of a 100 to 125 basis point increase. However, it also expects revenues to fall by 3% to 4% this financial year, \u201ctightening the previous expectation\u201d of a 2-4% drop. Revenues fell 6% in the last quarter, Under Armour reports today. But gross margin increased 100 basis points to 45.2 percent, driven primarily by \u201csupply chain benefits related to lower freight expense\u201d. That indicates that inflationary pressures hitting consumer goods makers are easing. Shares have risen 6% in pre-market trading. Santander UK have reportedly taken offence at an advert by rival Nationwide, in which Dominic West played an obnoxious bank chief. Sky News report that Santandar UK have filed a formal complaint with advertising watchdogs over a Nationwide campaign which \u201cdiscredits and denigrates\u201d Britain\u2019s high street banking industry. Sky\u2019s Mark Kleinman explains: Sky News has learnt that the Spanish-owned lender has told the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that the Nationwide television commercial - featuring the actor Dominic West as an arrogant bank boss - is misleading about its rivals\u2019 approach to closing branches. The complaint was filed during the autumn, soon after the building society campaign launched, according to insiders, but has not been publicly disclosed. The ASA has yet to adjudicate on the advert, in which West \u2013 the boss of A.N.Y Bank - produces a massive lunch bill before proposing branch closures, declaring: We\u2019re not Nationwide, are we? We\u2019re nothing like them. Over in Germany, house prices have dropped at the fastest pace on record. The German Real Estate Index, published by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, shows that property prices dropped sharply in Europe\u2019s largest economy last year. Sale prices of apartments fell by 8.9% during 2023, while single-family home price fell 11.3%. The price of multi-family homes dropped 20.1% during the year. The report says: The speed and extent of the current fall in real estate prices in Germany are historically unprecedented. Never since the expert committees started recording prices in the 1960s, have real estate prices fallen so quickly and sharply. Speculation is swirling over the future of parcel delivery firm Yodel. Yodel employs 10,000 staff and delivers goods for a number of retailers such as John Lewis, Argos and AO World. Sky News reported yesterday that the Barclay family, who own Yodel, are scrambling to find a buyer for the company. In response, Yodel said that it is \u201ccurrently exploring strategic development options\u201d and that \u201cany decisions taken will be made in the best interest of our clients, colleagues and key stakeholders\u201d. But if a buyer can\u2019t be found, Yodel could be forced to call in the administrators. The Daily Telegraph reported last night that Yodel was \u201cpreparing to call in administrators\u201d, as pressure for a cash injection mounted. They say: A source close to negotiations over Yodel\u2019s future said its looming financial obligations mean an urgent cash injection is required within two weeks. The business had never made a profit until the Government-imposed coronavirus lockdown massively boosted online shopping. Banks need to be more proactive in helping people who are struggling to pay their mortgages, reckons Alastair Douglas, CEO of TotallyMoney: \u201cThe latest figures show that more and more homeowners and landlords are falling into arrears, and we can expect the trend to continue as 1.7 million cheap fixed-rate deals come to an end this year. If you\u2019re somebody who\u2019s struggling, contact your lender and ask for support \u2014 and remember this won\u2019t impact your credit rating. However, missed payments can \u2014 and they could stay on your credit file for up to six years. If these persist, you might end up in mortgage arrears, leading to court action and even repossession. Banks need to be more proactive in issuing this support, and must reach out to people who they think might be in difficulty. Otherwise we won\u2019t just be looking at a mortgage crisis, but a mental health one too.\u201d More than 200 companies have joined a new US initiative, created by the Biden administration, to support the safe development and deployment of generative AI. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has announced the U.S. AI Safety Institute Consortium (AISIC) this morning. Many of the major players in AI have joined, including OpenAI, Google and Microsoft, along with Meta, Apple, Amazon.com, Nvidia, Palantir, and Intel. Financial groups JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are also on the list, as are BP, Cisco, IBM, Hewlett Packard, Northop Grumman, Mastercard, Qualcomm and Visa, and major academic institutions and government agencies. Raimondo says: \u201cThe U.S. government has a significant role to play in setting the standards and developing the tools we need to mitigate the risks and harness the immense potential of artificial intelligence.\u201d There\u2019s more takeover action bubbling in the City today. Shares in packaging firm DS Smith have jumped 10% after it revealed it has received a \u201chighly preliminary expression of interest\u201d from rival, and fellow FTSE 100 member, Mondi. It says: The Board of DS Smith understands that Mondi is considering a possible offer for DS Smith although no proposal has been received at this stage. There can be no certainty as to whether any proposal will be made or the terms of any such proposal. A further announcement will be made if and when appropriate. Mondi now has until 5.00pm on 7 March to make an offer, or walk away for six months. It\u2019s official: NatWest Group has announced the appointment of Wealth Management executive Emma Crystal as the new CEO of its Wealth Businesses, including Coutts, subject to regulatory approval. Paul Thwaite, NatWest\u2019s interim CEO, says: \u201cEmma\u2019s extensive Wealth Management experience and deep client focus make her the ideal person to lead our Wealth Businesses at this time. The UK Wealth Management market is large and growing and Emma\u2019s proven ability to work across organisational boundaries will be invaluable in helping us deliver an outstanding client experience and achieve our growth ambitions.\u201d As covered earlier (9.38am), the position has been vacant since Peter Flavel was pushed out of Coutts in the row over the \u201cdebanking\u201d of Nigel Farage. Rising cost-of-living pressures and higher interest rates have pushed more mortgage holders into arrears on their loans, new data shows. UK Finance reports that the number of homeowner mortgages in arrears increased by 7% in the last quarter of 2023, to 93,680. There was an 18% increase in buy-to-let mortgages in arrears, up to 13,570, as more landlords struggled to cope with higher borrowing costs. But although arrears are rising, the number of homeowner mortgaged homes being taken into possession dropped by 14% in the last quarter, to 540. Also, 500 BTL mortgaged properties were taken into possession in Q4, 11% greater than the previous quarter. That combined total of 1,040 repossessions in Q4 2023 is almost half the nearly 2,000 repossessed in the last three months of 2019, before the pandemic. Eric Leenders, managing director of Personal Finance at UK Finance, says: \u201cThe number of mortgage holders in arrears, whilst still low, is continuing to rise as the cost-of-living and high interest rates take their toll on households. Importantly, help is available to anyone worried about their finances \u2013 please reach out to your lender as soon as possible to discuss the support options available. Lenders have teams of trained experts ready to help. Contacting your lender to find out what support is available won\u2019t affect your credit score.\u201d NatWest Group is turning to an executive from UBS to run Coutts, its private bank, to succeed the top Coutts executive who was forced out during last year\u2019s \u2018debanking\u2019 row involving Nigel Farage. Sky News report: Sky News has learnt that NatWest has lured Emma Crystal, who has also worked for Credit Suisse, to become the next chief executive of its wealth management division, which includes Coutts. Ms Crystal, who is expected to join later this year, will replace Peter Flavel, who left NatWest last summer. The Guardian understands Crystal\u2019s appointment could be announced later today. Employees at almost one in 10 UK companies are having to work extra hours to make up for worker shortages, the latest realtime data from the UK economy shows. The Office for National Statistics says: In late January 2024, 19% of businesses with 10 or more employees reported they were experiencing worker shortages, broadly stable with late December 2023; of those businesses, 49% reported that their employees were working increased hours as a consequence. The ONS also reports that UK spending on debit and credit cards increased by 2% last week, and there was a small rise in footfall on the high street. China\u2019s deflation problem highlights the country\u2019s economic malaise, explains Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown: While inflation is still an unruly force central banks are attempting to tame in many nations, China is grappling with its evil twin. Deflation. Prices have fallen at their steepest rate since 2009, with the consumer price index falling 0.8% compared to a year earlier. Although falling food prices, particularly pork, is partly behind the trend. This was exacerbated by sharply lower demand during the month compared to last year due to the lunar new year celebrations landing in February, but underlying weakness remains with non-food inflation falling back. China is still mired in a property slump, affecting wealth perceptions and making consumers more cautious about spending big. Small stimulus measures aimed at increasing trading activity and lending into the economy have helped revive the Chinese stock market this week, but these are likely to be sticking plasters rather than a longer-term treatment for sluggish economy. Shipping giant Maersk has warned that oversupply in the sector will hit its earning this year, prompting it to suspend its share buy-back programme. In new financial guidance for 2024, Maersk says it could make an underlying loss of up to $5bn this year, although it could manage to break even. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation this year will be between $1bn and $6bn, Maersk predicts, down from $9.6bn in 2023. And while the Red Sea crisis is pushing up shipping rates, market conditions are likely to remain challenging, it says. Vincent Clerc, CEO of A.P. Moller-Maersk, explains: The current market remains one of robust volumes, but while the Red Sea crisis has caused immediate capacity constraints and a temporary increase in rates, eventually the oversupply in shipping capacity will lead to price pressure and impact our results. The ongoing disruptions and market volatility emphasize the need for supply chain resilience, further confirming that Maersk\u2019s path toward integrated logistics is the right choice for our customers to effectively manage these challenges. Having benefitted from soaring shipping rates in the pandemic, Maersk\u2019s earnings have been hit by the drop in prices to ship containers around the world. For 2023, it has reported profits on an EBIT basis of $3.9bn, down from $30.8bn in 2022. Last November, it announced 10,000 job cuts, due to the drop in demand triggered by the global economic slowdown. Shares in Maersk have dropped 13% this morning. Bad weather has hampered energy firm SSE\u2019s output from renewable power sources last year, and slowed the rollout of new wind turbines. SSE has reported that its SSE Renewables output over the last three quarters was around 15% below plan, having been hit by \u201cmixed weather conditions, short-term plant outages\u201d and the rephasing of its flexible hydro output. SEE says that \u201cexceptionally still and dry weather conditions\u201d hit output at its onshore wind, offshore wind and hydro business. Also, work on an offshore wind farm at Dogger Bank A has been disrupted by a series of storms. SSE says: Turbine installation on Dogger Bank A has been affected by challenging weather conditions with vessel availability and supply chain delays further impacting progress. SSE points out there have been 10 named storms in the 2023/24 season \u2013 Agnes, Babet, Ciaran, Debi, Elin, Fergus, Gerrit, Henk, Isha, and Jocelyn. John Moore, senior investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, says: \u201cUnfavourable weather has had a negative impact on SSE, showing it is not all plain sailing for the renewables sector even as the policy environment improves. Despite this, the company remains on target to meet its previous guidance for the year, with the transition to a rebased dividend that is part of its plans for shareholder returns combined with significant capex investment. SSE\u2019s shares are down -10% in the year to date, but it has strong prospects and a good amount of momentum, putting the company in a strong position \u2013 even if inclement weather conditions cause a blip in performance in the short term.\u201d The new boss of consumer goods giant Unilever has admitted that its competitiveness \u201cremains disappointing, despite a return to sales growth and a pick-up in profit margins. Unilever\u2019s CEO, Hein Schumacher, told the City: \u201cToday\u2019s results show an improving financial performance, with the return to volume growth and margins rebuilding. However, our competitiveness remains disappointing and overall performance needs to improve. We are working to address this by improving our execution to unlock Unilever\u2019s full potential.\u201d Unilever reported underlying sales growth of 7.0% for 2023 \u2013 due to a 6.8% increase in pries, and just 0.2% in sales volumes. Underlying price growth decelerated from 10.7% in the first quarter of last year to 2.8% in the fourth quarter, due to a slowdown in raw material inflation during 2023. Nutrition and Ice Cream faced the highest input cost inflation in 2023 which translated into higher pricing, Unilever says. Only around a third of the company\u2019s brands increased their market share last year, as customers in Europe shifted to supermarket brands, while Americans bought more \u201csuper-premium\u201d goods. Unilever\u2019s board has approved a share buyback programme of up to \u20ac1.5 billion to be conducted during 2024. Shares in the company have jumped by 3.4% in early trading. In the financial markets, Japan\u2019s Nikkei share index has closed at its highest level in 34 years. Investors in Toyko drove the Nikkei up to its highest closing level since February 20. Sentiment was boosted by a rally on Wall Street, where mega tech stocks continue to shine. Shares also rallied after a high-ranking Bank of Japan (BOJ) official signaled that the central bank would only tighten policy gradually. Reuters explains: BOJ Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida said in a speech that came in the middle of the morning trading session that conditions were falling into place for an exit from massive stimulus, but \u201ceven if the BOJ were to end our negative interest rate policy, it\u2019s hard to imagine a path in which it would then keep raising the interest rate rapidly.\u201d Bloomberg reports that economists see deflation pressure in China continuing for at least another six months, largely because of the real estate turmoil. They explain: While China was able to reach an official growth goal of \u201caround 5%\u201d in 2023, repeating a similar performance this year may be difficult without bigger efforts by policymakers. \u201cThe prolonged property woes and stock market volatility hurt household sentiment,\u201d said said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. Conditions are brightening in the UK property sector, surveyors say. Buyer demand, agreed sales, and new instructions all moved out of negative territory in January, the latest survey from The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) this morning shows. Surveyors also reported that house prices were lower, but at a slower pace than in recent months, RICS says, with signs of stabilisation in London, Scotland and the North West of England. RICS Senior Economist, Tarrant Parsons, says: \u201cThe UK housing market has seen a continued improvement in buyer activity through the early part of the year, supported by the recent easing in mortgage interest rates. Although sales volumes through much of the year ahead are likely to remain relatively subdued compared to the longer-term average, the outlook has now turned modestly brighter on a consistent basis over the past few survey reports. Here\u2019s Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, on today\u2019s China\u2019s inflation data: China announced this morning that deflation accelerated in January to -0.8% y-o-y, faster than a 0.5% deflation penciled in by analysts and the fastest price drop in over 14 years. In plain English, it means that the Chinese efforts to boost growth and bring inflation back are not working according to the plan. Money poured into the Chinese system doesn\u2019t circulate in a way to stimulate economy \u2013 blame people who lost confidence \u2013 and the radical measures that the government has put in place to prop up equity valuations hardly help China\u2019s battered stock markets to get back on their feet. Today, sentiment in the CPI 300 index is mixed. I was writing yesterday that a deeper than expected deflation number will certainly encourage Chinese authorities to announce more stimulus measures. But measures alone won\u2019t help getting the Chinese markets\u2019 heads above water if investors don\u2019t play along. Another worry about the Chinese recovery is that because the Chinese dream has been dashed by a $7 trillion selloff in the equity markets, many could be tempted to take their loss and walk away in the slightest recovery. In summary, the road to a sustainable recovery seems far away. China\u2019s January\u2019s -0.8% annual inflation reading could mark the low point in the current cycle, according to Lynn Song, ING\u2019s chief economist for Greater China. Song argues that China is not trapped in a \u201cdeflationary spiral\u201d, and predicts that pork prices could pick due to demand in this month\u2019s Lunar new year holidays. Song explains: Sequential data paints a more upbeat picture. In MoM terms, headline CPI rose 0.3%, food CPI rose 0.4%, and non-food CPI rose 0.2%. While a far cry from the above-target inflation levels seen in many other economies, these numbers do not imply China is stuck in a deflationary spiral. Furthermore, China\u2019s pork cycle also indicates that the drag from pork prices will also fade in the coming months. While still a major drag in January\u2019s data, pork price inflation has actually risen for the past two months, and the December 2023 MoM change in the pig stock was the largest decline since March 2022. With expected demand for the Lunar New Year holiday in February, this could return to positive growth in next month\u2019s release. As such, considering the more favourable base effects for February\u2019s data, we see a high likelihood that January\u2019s data could mark the low point for YoY inflation in the current cycle. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Consumer prices across China are falling at the fastest pace in 15 years, as its economy struggles with weak demand. China\u2019s consumer price index fell 0.8% year-on-year in January, data released this morning showed. It\u2019s the fourth straight month of declines, and the biggest contraction since 2009 after the financial crisis. The inflation rate was dragged down by falling food prices, which dropped by 5.9% year-on-year in January. Pork prices dropped by 17%, and were a major drag on inflation, while fresh vegetables were 12.7% cheaper than a year ago and fruit cost 9.1% less. China\u2019s factories continued to cut their prices last month, too. The producer price index (PPI) slid 2.5% from a year earlier in January after a 2.7% fall the previous month. China\u2019s consumer prices dropped into deflationary territory last summer, and prices have been flattish since. Its economy has struggled as the bounceback following the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions falters, and as its indebted real estates sector contracts. The drop in annual inflation puts more pressure on Beijing policymakers to take fresh steps to stimulate the economy. China\u2019s stock markets have rallied a little today. Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at capital.com, says the markets have \u201costensibly reacted favourably\u201d to disappointing Chinese price data. While a very concerning sign for China\u2019s economy, which could be becoming entrenched in a debt and deflation cycle, the markets arguably responded in a positive way to the news. Perhaps markets see the terribly low number as a potential catalyst for more muscular monetary or fiscal stimulus from the central government, which, up until this point, has been moderate in applying countercyclical policy.

            "title": "NHS nurses being investigated for \u2018industrial-scale\u2019 qualifications fraud",
            "date": "2024-02-14T07:00:32Z",
            "content": "Hundreds of frontline NHS staff are treating patients despite being under investigation for their part in an alleged \u201cindustrial-scale\u201d qualifications fraud. More than 700 nurses are caught up in a potential scandal, which a former head of the Royal College of Nursing said could put NHS patients at risk. The scam allegedly involves proxies impersonating nurses and taking a key test in Nigeria, which must be passed for them to become registered and allowed to work in the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very worrying if \u2026 there\u2019s an organisation that\u2019s involving themselves in fraudulent activity, enabling nurses to bypass these tests, or if they are using surrogates to do exams for them because the implication is that we end up in the UK with nurses who aren\u2019t competent,\u201d said Peter Carter, the ex-chief executive of the RCN and ex-chair of three NHS trusts, calling it an \u201cindustrial-scale fraud\u201d. He praised the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) for taking action against those involved \u201cto protect the quality of care and patient safety and the reputation of nurses\u201d. Nurses coming to work in the UK must be properly qualified, given nurses\u2019 role in administering drugs and intravenous infusions and responding to emergencies such as a cardiac arrest, Carter added. Forty-eight of the nurses are already working as nurses in the NHS because the NMC is unable to rescind their admission to its register, which anyone wanting to work as a nurse or midwife in Britain has to be, unless directed to do so by an independent panel at a hearing. In the meantime, it has told them to retake the test to prove their skills are good enough to meet its standards but cannot suspend them. The 48 are due to face individual hearings, starting in March, at which they will be asked to explain how they apparently took and passed the computer-based test (CBT) of numeracy and clinical knowledge taken at the Yunnik test centre in the city of Ibadan. At the hearings, a panel may direct the NMC to remove individuals from the register. The times recorded raised suspicions because they were among the fastest the nursing regulator had ever seen. But the NMC is taking more direct action with a 669-strong second batch of Nigerian health staff \u2013 again mostly nurses, but also including fewer than five midwives \u2013 whose test results it has found were also obtained through fraud. Most of them have also already come to the UK, sources say. However, they are in a different position to the 48 because they are thought to be mainly working as healthcare assistants in the NHS and care homes. That is because the NMC has not approved their applications to join its register while it continues to investigate widespread impersonation at the Yunnik test centre. About 80 nurses from the 669 applicants have obtained a new CBT test and applied to join the NMC register, so they can start working in that role. However, the nursing regulator has banned almost all of them because it had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about their honesty and trustworthiness. \u201cThis is because even with a new CBT there remains character concerns given what happened at Yunnik and what the data appeared to show about these individuals,\u201d the NMC said. Andrea Sutcliffe, the NMC\u2019s chief executive and registrar, said it had taken necessarily robust action after Pearson VUE, which had a contract with the Yunnik test centre, alerted it last year to what she called \u201cwidespread fraudulent activity\u201d in which a \u201cproxy tester\u201d posed as a nurse. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve found evidence of widespread fraud at a test centre,\u201d she said. It is the biggest-ever such fraud the NMC has come across, she added. The deception at Yunnik has led to the NMC declaring the CBT test results apparently obtained by 1,955 Nigerian-trained health professionals to be invalid. All of them, even including the 1,238 about whom the regulator says it cannot prove fraud was involved, have been given three chances to resit the CBT test, or face expulsion or exclusion from the register. \u201cWe have concerns that 48 people already on the register obtained their test result fraudulently. We\u2019ll hold hearings where an independent panel will decide whether those individuals gained fraudulent entry to our register. If so, they\u2019re likely to be removed from the register,\u201d said Sutcliffe. \u201cThere are 669 applicants to the register about whom we have the same fraud concerns. We\u2019re reviewing each application carefully in line with our guidance on health and character. We\u2019ve refused entry to the register for the vast majority of the 80 applications we\u2019ve considered so far, and those individuals can appeal.\u201d The future of the 717 nurses remains unclear. The GMB union fears that those refused on to the NMC register will be sent back to Nigeria. It said nurses had been \u201cexploited\u201d in Nigeria, urged the NMC to let all those with suspect test results to be allowed to retake the test in the UK and said the health service needed their skills to help address the UK-wide shortage of nurses. The GMB said two Nigerian women who are members had had their applications for NMC registration refused, despite insisting that their test results from Yunnik were legitimate. Both had then been dismissed by the private care home where they were working, until their status was established, and they now fear they will be deported to Nigeria with their families. \u201cThose in charge at this centre have exploited the hope of workers wanting to nurse in the UK and left our members in a desperate situation. \u201cThe profession\u2019s high standards of integrity must be enforced but these aspiring nurses were badly advised, firstly to enrol at this centre and then give questionable accounts of what happened there,\u201d said Louise Gilmour, the GMB\u2019s Scotland secretary. \u201cThey should be given another chance and allowed to work if they pass the necessary tests in the UK. \u201cThese are workers, mostly women, willing to uproot their lives and settle here to work in a health and social care service that is suffering a crisis in staff recruitment and retention.\u201d The NMC has stopped using 40 of the 800 test centres worldwide it used before the Yunnik fraud came to light, including Yunnik itself. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of the Nursing and Midwifery Council\u2019s (NMC) fraud investigations into nurses who passed their computer-based test in one centre in Nigeria. \u201cWe are advised that the NMC is taking all necessary steps to ensure the integrity of its register and that patient safety is protected.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 February 2024 to include details on how the Nursing and Midwifery Council could remove any nurses from its register. Also, an earlier version said that Pearson VUE operated the test centre in Yunnik; in fact it was a third-party test centre contracted to Pearson VUE. It was further amended to reinstate a reference to \u201cindustrial-scale fraud\u201d which had been removed during the editing process."

            "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s legal woes continue in Wisconsin, where the state\u2019s ethics commission has recommended felony charges against Trump\u2019s Save America Joint Fundraising Committee for its alleged role in a plot to bypass campaign finance limits. Trump is already facing 91 felony charges in criminal cases across multiple states related to his political and business dealings. The newest allegations in Wisconsin were first reported on Friday by the news site WisPolitics. The bipartisan ethics commission, which oversees the enforcement of campaign finance and lobbying laws in the state, recommended the charges in connection with a fundraising effort to target the Republican state assembly speaker, Robin Vos, during a 2022 primary challenge. Vos, who is the longest-serving assembly speaker in the state\u2019s history, has been a consistent target of Trump and his allies since refusing to aid Trump in his efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Wisconsin. Trump personally urged Vos to decertify the Wisconsin election results and, when the speaker said he could not do it under the state\u2019s constitution, released a statement accusing Vos of \u201cworking hard to cover up election corruption\u201d. The commission alleges Adam Steen, Vos\u2019s primary challenger, coordinated with state Republican party chapters to evade Wisconsin\u2019s $1,000 limit on individual campaign donations by having individuals funnel earmarked donations through the county parties, which face no limits on campaign spending. The commission found the effort generated more than $40,000 to benefit Vos\u2019s primary opponent. The state representative Janel Brandtjen, a vocal proponent of Trump\u2019s election lies in the Wisconsin legislature, was also implicated in the alleged scheme. Brandtjen allegedly helped coordinate donations earmarked for Steen\u2019s campaign from the Save America committee into multiple Republican party county chapters. Vos survived the primary attempt, but barely. Steen, who earned Trump\u2019s endorsement, lost by a mere 260 votes. Election-denying activists have most recently backed a campaign to recall Vos, which is still gathering petition signatures and has drawn the attention of national figures in the Maga movement, including the conspiracy theorist and MyPillow CEO, Mike Lindell. Lindell headlined an event and has promoted the effort on social media, writing that Vos had \u201cblocked our efforts to secure our elections\u201d in a post on the social media site X (formerly Twitter). The ethics commission also investigated a $4,000 donation by Lindell to a county party, but did not charge him, citing insufficient evidence the funds were directed to Vos\u2019s primary challenger."

            "title": "Record long-term sickness bodes ill for UK economic growth",
            "date": "2024-02-17T17:00:20Z",
            "content": "Britain has a sick economy and it is getting sicker. The clear message from last week\u2019s raft of economic data is that the UK is being held back by the growing number of people not able to work because of long-term illness. There are many theories about why the trend is worsening. Possible factors include long Covid, delays in NHS treatment as waiting lists grow longer, poor workplace practices, stress and the impact of austerity. But one thing is certain. The economic impact of ill health is a headache for Jeremy Hunt. It will be a headache for Rachel Reeves if she becomes the first female chancellor. It is a headache for every business that is struggling to fill vacancies. Figures released last week by the Office for National Statistics illustrated the extent of the problem. The number of people saying they are inactive due to long-term sickness is now 2.8 million \u2013 an increase of more than 200,000 in the past year and of 700,000 since the pandemic started in 2020. This matters, and not just for those who would be working if their circumstances were different. This high level of long-term illness helps explain why the UK\u2019s workforce is 700,000 smaller than its pre-Covid level, why the labour market is so tight and why the economy is flatlining. Jane Gratton, deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cBusinesses are growing increasingly concerned about higher levels of inactivity and its economic impact. It is impacting on growth and inflation. Wages are rising because of skills shortages. This has an effect on both employers and individuals.\u201d This is not a new issue. Large numbers of employees were invalided out of the workforce when factories and coalmines were closed in the de-industrialisation of the 1980s and 1990s. This century, Britain has had a higher percentage of people inactive due to ill health than Germany, France or Italy. But two new factors \u2013 Covid and longer NHS waiting lists \u2013 have made matters significantly worse in recent years. Yet what\u2019s especially worrying for economic policymakers is that Britain has gone from being the G7 country with the lowest levels of inactivity to the one where, uniquely, the workforce has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. The Office for Budget Responsibility has pointed out: \u201cThe available international evidence suggests that while the UK has consistently been a strong performer internationally in terms of working-age participation, its post-pandemic rise in inactivity stands out. And ill health has consistently been a bigger factor behind inactivity in the UK than in most other advanced economies, with post-pandemic trends likely to have amplified these differences.\u201d While it would be tempting to dub Britain the sick man of Europe, it would not be strictly accurate. Feminist thinktank the Women\u2019s Budget Group (WBG) has pointed out that there are 200,000 more women than men inactive due to ill health (1.5 million against 1.3 million). The WBG says this is not just down to Covid, but continues a trend that was evident before the pandemic. Zubaida Haque, the WBG\u2019s deputy director, said women were more likely to be in low-paid jobs and suffering the impact of austerity. \u201cThis has not been happening in a vacuum. Women were hit disproportionately by the pandemic but they were also more severely impacted by the benefit cuts made between 2010 and 2020. It is no good the government trying to deal with the symptoms of the problem.\u201d Hannah Slaughter, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the 2.8 million people inactive due to long-term sickness were a real concern: \u201cThis is holding back the economy, putting pressure on the public finances and the NHS, and limiting opportunities for too many people. Reversing this trend will be a priority for the current and next government.\u201d According to the Department for Work and Pensions, the government is already on the case. A spokesperson said: \u201cWith an extra 4 million people in work since 2010, we are now going even further, with welfare reforms forecast to reduce the number of people who would otherwise have been placed in the highest tier of incapacity benefits by over 370,000. \u201cOur back to work plan will help over a million people, including those with disabilities and long-term health conditions, to start and stay in work, as we continue to bring down inflation, cut taxes and grow the economy.\u201d One option for the government would be to try to fill the hundreds of thousands of job vacancies by tightening welfare conditions. But experts such as Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation thinktank, have warned that forcing people into work through punitive benefit sanctions would be counterproductive and might lead to more ill health. Whichever approach it decides to take, the government is under pressure to do more, both in terms of preventing illness, and in tailoring back-to-work programmes for those who take time off sick, ensuring that they don\u2019t exit the labour market altogether. While it is inactivity due to ill health that has grabbed the headlines recently, plenty of people with health problems are working, and are more likely to carry on if they get appropriate support. A study by the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank found people were more likely to leave work because of a heart condition than for any other health problem. The IPPR said someone suffering the onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 2021-22 had a 22% likelihood of leaving their job, compared with 14% for those with a mental health problem and 16% for those diagnosed with cancer. Chris Thomas, head of the IPPR\u2019s commission on health and prosperity, said: \u201cAfter great strides in tackling cardiovascular disease in the 20th century, the UK is now stalling, if not reversing. This is costing not just lives, but also livelihoods. The good news is that heart disease is one of the most preventable health conditions, but the government has to get on to the front foot and deliver proactive policies. Both human lives and economic prosperity depend on it.\u201d Gratton at the BCC said firms could help by allowing flexible working, investing more in occupational health and offering staff medical insurance. Jon Boys, senior research economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said the reduction in workers was compounding labour supply difficulties and limiting growth. There was ample evidence of both in last week\u2019s economic data, with the ONS reporting more than 900,000 job vacancies and unemployment below 4%, at a time when the UK economy was in recession. Boys said breaking down barriers to working for people with health problems should be a priority for policymakers and employers. Like Gratton, he said it was vital to focus on occupational health, to prevent individuals from exiting the workforce prematurely: \u201cIt is all very well getting people back into work but the bigger issue is not allowing them to fall out of it in the first place.\u201d Boys said both government and employers needed to address inactivity: employers through an awareness of the impact of stress in the workplace and addressing heavy and unsustainable workloads, and ministers by tackling NHS waiting lists. \u201cThe government has to recognise that health policy is economic policy,\u201d Boys said. \u201cThey can\u2019t be treated in silos.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-27T18:43:56Z",
            "content": "Puffing and wheezing its way on to the parliamentary agenda, the Department for Transport\u2019s long-promised bill to reform Britain\u2019s railways was finally published last week, in draft form. Almost certainly, given limited legislative time before the next election, it will never be voted into law. As Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, waspishly observed, it was fitting that this final act of strategic mismanagement should lead to a disastrously late arrival. It is six years since the government commissioned a review of the rail industry, following timetabling chaos in the north of England. Since then, multiple transport secretaries have presided over what has amounted to a rolling omnishambles. In the north, cancellations, late-running services and overcrowding have brought the network into disrepute. The cancellation of HS2 beyond Birmingham, and the related downgrading of Northern Powerhouse Rail, have made a mockery of the government\u2019s supposed levelling up ambitions. Nationally, ministers\u2019 mishandling of pay negotiations with unions has inflicted extended misery on travellers, and needlessly alienated an entire workforce. Most recently, government-backed plans to shut more than a thousand station ticket offices proved so unpopular that they were binned almost as soon as the public got wind of them. The common thread in this sorry sequence has been a refusal to invest sufficiently for the long term, and a blinkered determination to prioritise cost-cutting across the network. Since the pandemic, this Treasury-driven approach has assumed that the railways need to permanently adjust to a new reality, in which an economic model dependent on business travel no longer applies. Though passenger numbers are now back at 90% of the pre-Covid peak, revenues have not kept pace, and guaranteed income from commuter season tickets has fallen away. The new normal does not seem to have troubled the private companies that lease out Britain\u2019s trains \u2013 their profits trebled last year. But it is the lamentable shortsightedness in Whitehall that truly exasperates. According to forecasts from one specialist rail consultancy, the number of people travelling by train could double by 2050. This would be exactly the right direction of travel, helping the country make the necessary move to a greener transport network. Handled with imagination and flair \u2013 for example, in relation to ticketing \u2013 it could also deliver huge social benefits. But a misconceived austerity strategy is inflicting reputational damage as service standards drop, grievously undermining industry morale and risking a spiral of decline. Beyond a commitment to renationalise train operators as existing contracts expire, Labour has largely been keeping stumm about its own ideas. It has so far not ruled out creating an independent Great British Railways-type body to run the industry, as envisaged in the DfT\u2019s draft bill. But what the railways need above all is a government focused on growth not decline, which recognises the strategic importance of public transport in Britain\u2019s future. After a period in which industrial relations have reached rock bottom, the rail unions and train operators should be seen as partners in that wider vision. A new era of ambition and collaboration is required, after the scandalous dysfunction of recent years. The curtain must come down on a period in which passengers have been paying more for less, victims of an overbearing Treasury that has known the price of everything and the value of nothing."

            "title": "Growth in CO2 emissions leaves China likely to miss climate targets",
            "date": "2024-02-22T00:01:37Z",
            "content": "China is off track on all of its core 2025 climate targets, despite the fact that clean energy is now the biggest driver of the country\u2019s economic growth, analysis has found. After years of extraordinarily rapid growth, China is now grappling with a slowdown that is causing ripples internally and internationally. The government has supercharged the growth of the renewable energy industry but it has simultaneously poured stimulus funds into construction and manufacturing, and continues to approve coal power. China\u2019s total energy consumption increased by 5.7% in 2023, in the first moment since 2005 that demand for energy grew faster than its GDP. China\u2019s economy grew by 5.2% last year, a rate that would be rapid for most countries but is slow in comparison with previous rates of growth. But carbon dioxide emissions have continued to grow, even as economic growth has slowed due to the fact that China\u2019s economic growth during and after the Covid-19 pandemic has been highly energy intensive. Between 2021 and 2023, CO2 emissions grew at an average of 3.8% a year, up from 0.9% a year between 2016 and 2020. GDP growth slowed slightly over the same period. The findings were published in an analysis from Carbon Brief conducted by Lauri Myllyvirta, a lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). Under the Paris agreement, China\u2019s climate pledges require a number of targets to be met by 2025; these include increasing the share of non-fossil energy sources to 20% and reducing the carbon intensity of the economy by 18%. Carbon intensity refers to how many grams of CO2 are released to produce a kilowatt hour of electricity. However, Myllyvirta\u2019s analysis found that China was \u201cway off track\u201d on many of these targets, primarily because of the carbon intensity of recent economic growth. CO2 emissions will have to fall by between 4% and 6% to meet the government\u2019s 2025 target, Myllyvirta predicts. Part of the problem stems from the fact that during the Covid-19 pandemic, the government supported the economy by injecting stimulus measures into the construction and manufacturing sector, \u201cshifting the pattern of growth into a more carbon-intensive direction\u201d, said Myllyvirta. At the same time, many other countries targeted their stimulus measures towards households, driving up demand for consumer goods, resulting in an export boom from China. It is not impossible to do, said Myllyvirta: \u201cOptimistically, these distortions to the economic structure before and during zero-Covid could be reversed, and that combined with the clean energy drive could serve to bring down emissions rapidly.\u201d Around one percentage point of China\u2019s CO2 emissions growth last year came from manufacturing clean energy technologies, such as solar PV, electric vehicles and batteries. These products will ultimately lead to a net drop in emissions, although some of that will be felt outside China as goods are exported. Part of the challenge in understanding China\u2019s energy transition is that the numbers involved in every sector are of global significance. Despite the fact that, in 2023, China commissioned as much solar PV as the entire world did in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency, the rapid growth in energy demand in recent years has outstripped the clean energy additions. On the current trend of increased energy demands, energy production from non-fossil sources would need to grow by more than 11% a year to meet the 2025 target. Currently, renewable energy production is increasing by an annual rate of 8.5%. Clean energy contributed $1.6tn (\u00a31.26tn) to China\u2019s economy in 2023, accounting for all of the growth in investment. And on the target of reducing the carbon intensity of China\u2019s economy by 18% by 2025, China has so far managed only a 5% reduction since 2020. That means that CO2 emissions will have to come down in absolute terms from 2023 to 2025 to meet the target. According to the National Energy Administration, China\u2019s installed capacity of renewable energy exceeded 1.45bn kilowatts in 2023, accounting for more than half of the country\u2019s total installed power generation capacity. But a separate report published on Thursday by CREA and Global Energy Monitor found that China approved 114 gigawatts (GW) of coal power in 2023, up from 104 GW in 2022. China\u2019s share of global coal emissions surpassed 64% in 2023. Since Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, pledged to \u201cstrictly control\u201d new coal power in 2021, the approval of new coal has actually increased rapidly. Nearly half of the growth in power generation between 2020 and 2023 came from coal. That is partly because some thermal power developers and government officials see this decade as a window of opportunity in which CO2 emissions can continue to increase before 2030, when Xi has promised they will peak. Still, China is widely expected to meet that target by 2025. Local governments, particularly mining provinces, often rely on investment in coalmines and thermal power sources to boost their GDP figures. Myllyvirta said: \u201cThe major acceleration in coal consumption growth and in approvals of new coal power plants that has taken place since President Xi made these pledges in 2021 contradicts the commitments \u2013 and China needs to take determined action in 2024-25 to avoid failing to respect them.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 27 February 2024 to credit Global Energy Monitor as co-authors with CREA of one of the reports cited."

The world\u2019s largest retailer generated revenue of $170bn in the three months to December, up 14% on the same period of 2022, and clearing expectations on Wall Street of about $166bn. Net income hit $10.6bn in the fourth quarter, from $278m a year previously, after the company moved to cut costs and draw a line under years of rapid expansion following the onset of the pandemic. Earnings per share hit $1.03. Shares in the business rose 5.5% during out-of-hours trading in New York. After Amazon, valued at $1.6tn on the stock market, cut 27,000 jobs last year, the layoffs have continued, albeit at a lesser pace, in recent weeks. On Thursday, Andy Jassy, the group\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThis Q4 was a record-breaking holiday shopping season and closed out a robust 2023 for Amazon. While we made meaningful revenue, operating income and free cash flow progress, what we\u2019re most pleased with is the continued invention and customer experience improvements across our businesses.\u201d Amazon has built a sprawling digital empire around its e-commerce platform, from smart speakers to sports broadcasting. Through Amazon Web Services (AWS), it also leads the lucrative cloud computing market, though Microsoft, now worth $3tn, has eaten into its lead as operators work to integrate artificial intelligence into their offerings. The company announced it would integrate a shopping assistant, powered by AI and named Rufus, into its app prior to the earnings call. Jassy said on the earnings call that Amazon\u2019s AI offerings are \u201creally resonating with customers\u201d, though revenue had yet to make a meaningful contribution to the company\u2019s bottom line. On Thursday, the company said it is launching an AI-powered shopping assistant named Rufus on its mobile app. Regulators have sought to curb the company\u2019s growth: earlier this week, Amazon abandoned a planned $1.4bn acquisition of the robot vacuum cleaner company iRobot amid European opposition to the deal. US regulators announced last week they would probe the company\u2019s deals with fledgling AI companies such as Anthropic. Revenue at AWS increased 13% to $24.2bn in the fourth quarter. Amazon\u2019s fast-growing advertising business continues to \u201cdrive positive results\u201d, Jassy noted: sales generated by the division climbed 27% to $14.7bn. For the current quarter, which runs to March, Amazon forecast sales growth of up to 13%. Operating profits are also set to rise significantly, it estimated, from $4.8bn to between $8bn and $12bn."

            "title": "To revive Britain from recession the next government must get growth right | Richard Partington",
            "date": "2024-02-18T11:56:36Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy is in a deep rut. After news confirming the country fell into recession late last year, most experts agree the downturn is likely to be shortlived and shallow. Few, though, are betting on a strong recovery from the toughest period for living standards in almost 70 years. In most of the economic cycles of the past century, robust growth has typically followed each period of recession, as households and businesses get back on their feet after each setback. But as highlighted by Matt Whittaker of the Pro Bono Economics thinktank, the past two decades have been different. Gross domestic product per capita has either fallen or flatlined for the past seven quarters, and it is now 16 years since the last sustained uptick came to an end. For whoever wins the next general election, making sure Britain can escape this quagmire ought to be the top priority. After more than a decade and a half of flatlining progress, capped by the current cost of living crisis, poverty levels have risen sharply. The proceeds of what little growth has been eked out are unevenly spread and geographically imbalanced, while the UK is slipping behind comparable advanced nations. To revive the sputtering engine of the economy, the next government will, however, need to keep in mind the kind of growth Britain would benefit from most. The plan will need two priorities in particular: tackling the inequalities entrenched over the past decade, and ensuring the biggest challenge of all \u2013 the climate crisis \u2013 is addressed. So far there is reluctance among political leaders to set out a clear roadmap, with Rishi Sunak promising tax cuts that would fail on the first priority while increasingly hacking away at policies that could help address the second. The prime minister had promised in the first weeks of his premiership to turn Britain into a \u201cclean energy superpower\u201d. Since then, however, Sunak has rowed back on net zero policies and leaned into anti-green politics to pacify the right of his party. Keir Starmer has also staged a managed retreat, having scaled back Labour\u2019s \u00a328bn green investment plan out of fear the Tories could weaponise it in the election campaign. At the heart of both is a common theme: affordability. The fallout from the 2008 financial crisis, Covid pandemic, Brexit and the cumulative drag on productivity from more than a decade of Tory underinvestment has indeed taken its toll on the exchequer, as has spiralling demand from an ageing population. The government\u2019s budget deficit is historically high, while the national debt has risen to the highest level since the 1960s. However, it also plays on two falsehoods. First, that inaction is cost-free. This is patently untrue, as the past 15 years of underinvestment have shown, laying the ground for our current weak economic performance. The consequences of the climate crisis are also becoming clearer and costlier for households and businesses. And second, that leaving the private sector alone to kickstart growth and manage the climate transition would be cheaper. The cost of investing in new technologies does not magically vanish in the private sector. Instead of being borne on the government balance sheet \u2013 paid for mostly through taxation \u2013 the household balance sheet picks it up instead, in the prices charged for utilities, goods and services. As a paper from the leftwing Common Wealth thinktank last week showed, state-led investment in clean energy could be substantially cheaper than the private sector equivalent, primarily through the difference in cheaper borrowing costs that nations enjoy over corporate borrowers, helping households to save money on their bills. Investing in the climate transition could also help kickstart economic growth, creating the jobs and industries of the future. The report set out the case for a more ambitious plan for Labour\u2019s Great British Energy, the party\u2019s publicly owned clean energy generation company. According to the report, Labour\u2019s initial \u00a38.3bn capitalisation of GB Energy could save between \u00a3125m and \u00a3208m a year on debt interest costs each year compared with equivalent borrowing in the private sector \u2013 saving up to \u00a31bn in total. While Starmer cut back Labour\u2019s overall \u00a328bn investment plan, the decision to keep and prioritise GB Energy is an important move. Plenty of details over its operation still need clarifying. And it could be more ambitious. But a publicly owned firm investing in renewable energy could help optimise the transition to net zero. One criticism would be that the state lacks the knowhow big energy companies possess, or would be less efficient than the private sector, adding to the cost of energy generation. However, it is increasingly clear the market alone is failing to deliver, as some of the wealthiest energy firms in history funnel profits into investor payouts rather than renewables. Over the last two years energy companies have benefited from a boom in prices since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, providing what ought to be a powerful war chest for the green transition. But analysis by the IPPR thinktank shows that BP and Shell alone handed \u00a332.6bn back to their investors in 2022 through dividends and share buybacks \u2013 11 times more than the \u00a32.9bn they invested in renewables. In a world of rising supply chain costs, geopolitical shocks and higher borrowing costs on financial markets, a state-backed firm could help de-risk the cost of renewables projects for private firms by co-investing alongside them. It makes even more sense when the approach is already the norm in Britain \u2013 only with companies owned by overseas governments rather than our own. Figures from Common Wealth show 42.2% of the installed capacity from operational and under-construction windfarms in the UK is owned by foreign public entities, including state-owned enterprises and public pension funds. Such is the lack of our own involvement that the UK government owns less of that capacity (0.03%) than the city of Munich does (0.85%) through its stake in the Gwynt y M\u00f4r windfarm off the north Wales coast. The next government will have choices to make. Powering up economic growth could be helped by a step-change in green investment. Rather than holding back amid fears over affordability, it\u2019s the cost of inaction that would hurt more."

            "date": "2024-02-08T09:00:08Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s leading agricultural research facility is facing a funding crisis with part of its future work in jeopardy, it can be revealed. Rothamsted Research in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, is one of the oldest agricultural research institutions in the world, having been founded in 1843, and its research has been credited with preventing crop failures across the globe. A letter from Rothamsted\u2019s director, Prof Angela Karp, seen by the Guardian, has warned staff they will have to pause \u201cnon-essential\u201d work, announcing a hiring pause and warning of pay freezes. Worried scientists have said they fear for their work, which is dependent on funding. About 350 scientists and 60 PhD students work at the facility. Its research includes work into how farmers can be productive while growing trees in their fields, finding out how much carbon crops can store, and two national networks for monitoring insect populations in the UK. Rothamsted hit the headlines in 2012 when about 200 anti-genetic modification protesters occupied the site to campaign against their research into a wheat crop that would deter aphids. Rothamsted receives the majority of its funding as a core grant directly from the government\u2019s UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) department, in five-year cycles. For the past two cycles the institute\u2019s funding has included no inflation costs. For several years the institute has been running at a loss, with the government stepping in occasionally to top up funds. While the UK was in the EU, Rothamsted also benefited from funding from the European regional development fund, which it is no longer entitled to. Now, the situation is understood to be at crisis point, with future operations by the facility uncertain. Karp wrote: \u201cI feel that it is important for me to inform staff that, after a promising start, unfortunately our financial position weakened in the latter part of last year. Despite all our ongoing efforts, including excellent successes from many staff that we can be proud of, our grant targets won for the whole year were not as we had budgeted for. \u201cWhilst free reserves have been maintained, these still remain lower than we would like and highly susceptible to external factors, and we are currently considering how best to manage our operating model to put our longer-term future on a more secure footing. \u201cTo some extent we have managed the challenges we faced during 2023 through rebalancing funds within the IAE envelope. However, the mitigation steps we have been taking cannot be relied on from now onwards and we do not have enough reserves that we can access immediately.\u201d Rothamsted has estimated its worth to the UK economy as \u00a33bn a year because its work helps crop yields, both by determining which crops grow most efficiently and by developing plants which are tolerant to diseases and extreme weather. A large part of the government\u2019s offer to farmers post-Brexit, as they struggle with a lack of workers and new environmental rules for government payments, is promised new research. This would make farmers be able to work more efficiently, using fewer inputs such as fertiliser, and also need fewer staff as innovations such as robotic vegetable pickers are developed. A UKRI spokesperson said: \u201cThough a core funder of Rothamsted Research, the BBSRC (Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council) recognises and upholds the institute\u2019s legal and governance distinctiveness. We encourage our strategically supported institutes to seek research funding from a broad range of funders to support research beyond those activities which we fund through a range of schemes.\u201d A spokesperson for Rothamsted Research said: \u201cWe are fully focussed on our scientific programme, generating impactful outcomes from our many research commitments, and remain very much \u2018open for business\u2019 for all our partners and collaborators.\u201d They added that the research centre\u2019s science \u201cis in a great place\u201d and had been \u201cexhaustively peer reviewed for the next 5 years of BBSRC funding\u201d. \u201cWe acknowledge the financial situation is challenging, as it is for many similar institutes and universities, and are working hard to implement necessary change as would be expected from any effective management team,\u201d the spokesperson said. The top Rothamsted experiments The Park Grass experiment The Park Grass experiment is one of the longest-running experiments of modern science; it began in 1856 and has been going ever since. What it most vividly shows is how biodiversity plummets when you add fertiliser to hay meadows. The study is conducted in Rothamsted Park in Harpenden on 2.8 hectares (6.9 acres) of parkland that had been in permanent pasture for at least 100 years. The purpose was originally to find out how to improve hay yields by adding either inorganic fertiliser or organic manures. However, within a couple of years scientists noticed that wild species diversity massively decreased because the fertilisers changed the soil pH and nutrient composition. On the unfertilised spots, scientists noted 35-45 species, but there were only two or three on those treated with artificial fertiliser. Once established to help crop yields, park grass is now a very important source of evidence for ecologists and soil scientists. Artificial fertilisers Sir John Bennet Lawes, 1st Baronet, inherited the Rothamsted estate from his father. He founded the research centre, which first began with his own experiments on the effects of manures on potted plants and field crops in the grounds. He went on to patent treating phosphate rock with sulphuric acid to produce superphosphate, a fertiliser, before opening a fertiliser factory. Although they are a bete noir of environmentalists now, partly due to the park grass experiment which revealed their harm to nature, human-made fertilisers have helped feed the world. Revealing the insect apocalypse Rothamsted\u2019s moth trap survey has been running since the 1960s. This provides the basis of moth data in the UK, which has revealed their decline. The moth traps provide the most comprehensive standardised long-term data on insects in the world. The 16 traps provide farmers with information on the timing and size of aphid migrations to prevent heavy prophylactic use of insecticides. Butterfly discoveries Rothamsted discovered the secrets of the painted lady migration \u2013 the fact that British-born butterflies return from northern Europe and the Arctic to Africa at the end of the summer. It was Rothamsted radar that got pictures of the butterflies high up in the air, far higher than people thought they flew. In one of the largest citizen science projects ever recorded, Rothamsted scientists found out where butterflies go when they migrate. It was known the butterfly migrated from the continent each summer to UK shores in varying numbers. But scientists did not previously know if the painted lady made the return journey at the end of the summer, like the closely related red admiral, or simply died in the UK. They found the painted lady did indeed migrate south each autumn \u2013 but mades this return journey at high altitudes, out of view of butterfly observers on the ground. Radar records revealed that painted ladies flew at an average altitude of more than 500 metres on their southbound trip and could clock up speeds of 30mph. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 February 2024 to add a comment from Rothamsted Research that was received after publication, and to further emphasise it is \u201cpart\u201d of the institution\u2019s work that is affected by the funding shortfall."

            "date": "2024-02-15T00:01:01Z",
            "content": "Keir Starmer is being urged to more than double Labour\u2019s investment in publicly owned renewable energy to save consumers billions of pounds on their bills, despite the party drastically scaling back its plans last week. In an intervention after the Labour leader scrapped the party\u2019s \u00a328bn green investment pledge in the most controversial U-turn of his leadership, the Common Wealth thinktank said a step-change in government backing for clean energy generation was still required. It said plans to retain an initial cash injection in Great British Energy \u2013 a state-owned renewable power generation company planned if Labour is elected to power \u2013 was an important \u201cdown payment\u201d, but should be increased to \u00a330bn over the course of a first term in office. There have been growing questions over Labour\u2019s target to decarbonise the UK\u2019s electricity system by 2030 after it slashed the funding package behind its green economy plans by half. As a key group influencing Ed Miliband, the shadow net zero secretary, Common Wealth was the first thinktank to promote a new publicly owned energy generator \u2013 providing backing for GB Energy \u2013 based on similar European firms such as Sweden\u2019s Vattenfall, Denmark\u2019s \u00d8rsted and Norway\u2019s Equinor. Miliband is understood to have pushed back against the dilution of Labour\u2019s \u00a328bn investment plan, with speculation \u2013 denied by his team \u2013 that he could resign over the issue. However, in a sign of unity, he contributed a quote to the press release confirming it would be scaled back. Labour has said GB Energy would be headquartered in Scotland as a \u201chomegrown, publicly owned champion in clean energy generation\u201d to enable the creation of jobs and manufacturing in Britain\u2019s renewables sector. However, several details remain unclear, including whether it would operate green assets directly or control a portfolio of investments in other companies instead. Labour said last week that GB Energy would \u201cpartner with industry\u201d and \u201cco-invest\u201d in groundbreaking green technologies such as floating offshore wind, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and tidal stream energy. It has also suggested the party would help capital-intensive projects such as the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk with \u201cbacking and building\u201d. The government is, however, seeking significantly more investment for the project than Labour currently plans for GB Energy, with ministers looking to raise \u00a320bn from outside investors after removing the Chinese state-owned group CGN in 2022 over security concerns. In a report setting out the case for a vast expansion of GB Energy in the early years of a Labour government, Common Wealth said state-led investment in clean energy would be substantially cheaper than the private sector equivalent \u2013 helping to save households money on their bills. It said renewable investment financed out of Labour\u2019s initial \u00a38.3bn capitalisation would save between \u00a3125m and \u00a3208m a year on debt interest costs each year \u2013 saving up to \u00a31bn in total compared with private-sector borrowing, which is typically more expensive. Analysis in the report was based on estimates from the International Energy Association that a 2 percentage point increase in borrowing costs can lead to a 20% increase in a solar or wind project\u2019s \u201clevelised cost of electricity\u201d, a measure of the average cost of each unit of electricity generated over the lifetime of an asset. Common Wealth said this was a good proxy for the savings between government-backed investment and the private sector, which could be passed on to households in the form of cheaper bills. Mathew Lawrence, Common Wealth\u2019s director, said: \u201cKeir Starmer\u2019s renewed commitment to GB Energy, Labour\u2019s proposed new public renewables company, is welcome. However, the true test of ambition is in its design and scale. \u201cAn ambitious public renewables company like GB Energy on the scale of leading international equivalents would mean lower energy bills, good jobs in every part of the country, faster decarbonisation and energy independence for the UK - indeed it is the cornerstone of any serious attempt to transition our economy.\u201d A Labour spokesperson said: \u201cWith Labour\u2019s ambitious \u00a38.3bn capitalisation of Great British Energy, we will invest in clean homegrown power that will cut energy bills, create the next generation of jobs in clean industries, and make Britain energy independent.\u201d"

            "content": "Welsh ministers have claimed their controversial 20mph limit rollout has proved successful after figures suggested speeds on many roads had dropped by 4mph. However, opponents of the scheme say the modest reduction shows the policy has been a \u201cmonumental\u201d waste of money and called for it to be scrapped. The Labour-led government said Transport for Wales monitored the speed of millions of vehicles in nine communities and found that average speeds on the 20mph roads it had studied fell from 28.9mph before the rollout to 24.8mph. When it launched the scheme last year, the government said it did not expect all motorists to immediately drop their speed to 20mph but argued that any reduction was good for other road users. The government said research showed a strong link between lowering speeds and decreasing the number of collisions and people injured. On urban roads with low average speeds, there is an average 6% reduction in collisions per 1mph reduction in average speed, it says. Lee Waters, the deputy minister for climate change, said: \u201cThe latest data published today is clear evidence that average speeds are coming down on roads across Wales. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a way to go, but it\u2019s encouraging to see that things are moving in the right direction. Every 1mph reduction in speed makes a real difference \u2013 so this is a real turning point. \u201cThe international evidence is clear: lower speeds saves lives \u2013 that\u2019s fewer collisions, fewer deaths and fewer severe injuries, reducing the devastation to individuals and their families and the significant impact on the NHS and other emergency services.\u201d Natasha Asghar, the Welsh Conservative shadow minister for transport, said: \u201cThese findings prove what a monumental waste of time and resources from the Labour government the 20mph limit has been. On day one of a Welsh Conservative government, this barmy policy would be scrapped, and common sense would prevail.\u201d The chief executive of the road safety charity Brake, Ross Moorlock, said: \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see how the new 20mph speed limit has reduced the overall speeds of these roads. \u201cEvery day, five people die on UK roads and speed is a factor in every crash. The faster we drive, the greater our risk of crashing, and the harder we hit if we do crash. \u201cWe hope that governments and local authorities across the UK will take Wales\u2019s lead and adopt 20mph as the default speed on roads where people and vehicles mix.\u201d Both the candidates to replace Mark Drakeford as first minister next month have expressed concerns about the 20mph scheme. Vaughan Gething said the government had got some of the messaging wrong but that he wanted it to work. Jeremy Miles said it was the right policy but a review needed to be brought forward."

The bill passed with a 320-99 vote on Thursday afternoon. Among Republicans, 113 voted yes and 97 voted no. Meanwhile, 207 Democrats voted yes and two voted against it. The two Democrats who voted against the bill were Mike Quigley of Illinois and Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts. The bill\u2019s passage comes after congressional leaders from both parties, including the House speaker, Mike Johnson; the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries; the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer; the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell; as well as leaders of the House and Senate appropriations committees, announced the agreement on Wednesday. \u201cTo give the House and Senate appropriations committees adequate time to execute on this deal in principle, including drafting, preparing report language, scoring and other technical matters and to allow members 72 hours to review, a short-term continuing resolution to fund agencies through March 8 and the 22 will be necessary, and voted on by the House and Senate this week,\u201d the statement said. With the House passing the temporary funding bill on Thursday, a congressional vote is now expected next week for six full-year appropriations bills that will extend funding for agencies under the departments of agriculture-FDA, commerce-justice and science, energy and water development, interior, military construction-veterans affairs and transportation-housing and urban development. \u201cThese bills will adhere to the Fiscal Responsibility Act discretionary spending limits and January\u2019s topline spending agreement,\u201d congressional leaders said on Wednesday. The remaining six appropriations bills set to be finalized and voted on by 22 March revolve around the departments of defense, financial services and general government, homeland security, labor-health and human services, as well as legislative branch and state and foreign operations. Following Thursday\u2019s vote, Virginia\u2019s Democratic representative Abigail Spanberger said that despite voting alongside colleagues who \u201cunderstand our fundamental responsibility to keep our government functioning \u2026 Speaker Johnson\u2019s leadership has our country yet again one week away from a partial government shutdown and within a month of the whole of the federal government shutting its doors. \u201cAs our country remains on a collision course with a completely preventable potential shutdown, I will continue to press Speaker Johnson to bring bipartisan bills forward that would pass in the US House, pass in the US Senate, and get to the president\u2019s desk,\u201d she added. Before Thursday\u2019s vote, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris met with congressional leaders in attempts to help avert a partial government shutdown, which Biden said would \u201csignificantly\u201d damage the economy.

He was also in charge of steering the overseas operations bill through the House of Commons, which sought to reduce the liability of UK forces from facing war crimes trials by introducing a statute of limitations and other bars to prosecution. If these egregious parts of the bill had passed into law, this might well have prevented the prosecution of the alleged crimes being reported to him. I should just add that this entire chapter has been accompanied by a wholesale attack on those lawyers who had the courage to take on such cases.

            "content": "We are now closing this blog but you can read all our Ukraine coverage here. It is now approaching 6pm in Kyiv. Here is a summary of the main developments from today: The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said the west are attempting to \u201cdestroy us\u201d and to \u201ccontain our development\u201d in his annual address to parliament. He said: \u201cThe so called West with its so colonialist tendencies is striving not only to contain our development but they are intent on destroying us and using our space for whatever their purposes are including Ukraine. Putin also said Russia will fight back and \u201cdefeat\u201d Nato on their own territory against the threat of expansion, which he warned could trigger a nuclear war. He said: \u201cThey are preparing to strike our territory and using the best possible forces most effective forces to do so. But we remember the fate of those who tried to invade our territory and of course their fate will be much more tragic than anything that we could face.\u201d European defence and foreign ministers will meet in Paris in coming days to discuss further support for Ukraine and Moldova, a French foreign ministry spokesperson said on Thursday. Russian authorities on Thursday detained journalist Sergei Sokolov, the editor of Novaya Gazeta, on charges of discrediting the army, the newspaper and Russian state media reported. Novaya Gazeta said in an online report that Sokolov\u2019s detention was over coverage of the Russian army in an article, but did not provide more details, according to Reuters. The European parliament said on Thursday Russian president Vladimir Putin bore the \u201ccriminal and political responsibility\u201d for opposition leader Alexei Navalny\u2019s death and should be held to account. AFP reports that in a resolution passed with 506 votes in the 705-seat assembly, the parliament said \u201cThe Russian government and Vladimir Putin personally bear criminal and political responsibility for the death of their most prominent opponent, Alexei Navalny.\u201d Ukraine has identified 511 people suspected of war crimes since Russia\u2019s Feb. 2022 invasion and has already handed down 81 convictions, its prosecutor general said in Kyiv on Thursday. Andriy Kostin was speaking at a war crimes conference alongside the chief prosecutors of Poland, Lithuania, Romania and the President of the EU justice arm, Eurojust. Ukraine\u2019s military said on Thursday it had shot down three more Russian Su-34 fighter-bombers, the latest successes it has reported against Moscow\u2019s air force. On Telegram, army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said: \u201cAfter successful combat operations against an enemy aircraft in the night on Feb. 29, two more Russian aircraft were destroyed: Su-34 fighter-bombers in the Avdiivka and Mariupol sectors.\u201d A Russian court on Thursday rejected an appeal by a Russian-American woman against her detention on a treason charge. The FSB Security Service said last week that Ksenia Karelina had been detained on suspicion of raising funds for Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. The Los Angeles resident had been collecting funds for a Ukrainian organisation whose ultimate beneficiary was the Ukrainian army, the FSB said. Sri Lanka has decided to stop issuing free long-term visas to Russian and Ukrainian nationals who have lived in the Indian Ocean island nation for the past two years, a government official said on Thursday. Russian president Vladimir Putin said he believes it is important for Russia to strengthen ties with Arab countries and Latin American countries during his annual address to the nation. Ukrainian forces have pushed back Russian troops from the village of Orlivka, west of Avdiivka, but the situation on the eastern front remains difficult, Ukrainian army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Thursday. Orlivka is less than 2 kilometres northwest of Lastochkyne, which was recently occupied by Russian forces. Ukraine plans to export a high volume of electricity on Thursday, taking advantage of lower domestic consumption during a spell of mild weather, the energy ministry said. The country\u2019s electricity exports, which began shortly before it was invaded by Russian troops in 2022, were halted after numerous Russian attacks on power infrastructure and the seizure of the largest nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia. Russian authorities on Thursday detained journalist Sergei Sokolov, the editor of Novaya Gazeta, on charges of discrediting the army, the newspaper and Russian state media reported. Novaya Gazeta said in an online report that Sokolov\u2019s detention was over coverage of the Russian army in an article, but did not provide more details, according to Reuters. Russian news agency Tass reported that Sokolov had \u201cposted material on the Novaya Gazeta Telegram channel\u201d which showed \u201csigns of verbal discrediting the actions\u201d of the army. Sokolov faces a fine of up to 50,000 roubles ($550), Tass and Novaya Gazeta both reported. Novaya Gazeta is known for its investigations which have sometimes taken aim at the Kremlin, government policy and top officials. Its former editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov, a Nobel prize winning journalist, stepped aside in September to challenge his designation by authorities as a \u201cforeign agent\u201d, a label Moscow uses to stigmatise and complicate the life of people it deems to be working against Russian state interests. The European parliament said on Thursday Russian president Vladimir Putin bore the \u201ccriminal and political responsibility\u201d for opposition leader Alexei Navalny\u2019s death and should be held to account. AFP reports that in a resolution passed with 506 votes in the 705-seat assembly, the parliament said \u201cThe Russian government and Vladimir Putin personally bear criminal and political responsibility for the death of their most prominent opponent, Alexei Navalny.\u201d Lawmakers called for an \u201cindependent and transparent international investigation\u201d into the circumstances of Navalny\u2019s death and asked the EU\u2019s 27 members states to \u201cintensify\u201d support for Russian political prisoners. Nine lawmakers voted against the resolution. In a separate development, allies of Navalny said attempts to hire a hearse to take his body to his funeral service on Friday had been blocked. Reuters reports that Kira Yarmysh, a spokesperson for Navalny, said on social that unknown individuals had been threatening hearse providers by phone. European defence and foreign ministers will meet in Paris in coming days to discuss further support for Ukraine and Moldova, a French foreign ministry spokesperson said on Thursday. Reuters reports they added that European states would discuss further concrete measures for Ukraine and how to defend countries being destabilised by Russia, notably Moldova. Ukraine has identified 511 people suspected of war crimes since Russia\u2019s Feb. 2022 invasion and has already handed down 81 convictions, its prosecutor general said in Kyiv on Thursday. Andriy Kostin was speaking at a war crimes conference alongside the chief prosecutors of Poland, Lithuania, Romania and the President of the EU justice arm, Eurojust. At a press conference after their meeting, the prosecutors announced the signing of a two-year extension to the work of the Joint Investigation Team, an initiative by five European Union countries to probe war crimes in the conflict, Reuters reports. Russia has denied its troops commit war crimes, despite the conflict having killed thousands of Ukrainian civilians. The JIT is conducting what Eurojust chief Ladislav Harman called the \u201cbiggest investigation of war crimes in history.\u201d Lithuanian Prosecutor Gen Nida Grunskiene said the JIT had so far spoken to over 5,000 Ukrainians as part of their investigations. Commenting on the 81 convictions, Kostin acknowledged that most had been conducted without the suspects in custody. He said Ukraine wanted to get justice as quickly as possible instead of waiting until the end of the war. \u201cMost of these convictions are in absentia, but it speaks to the fact that we are securing justice right now,\u201d he said. Kostin added that discussions were taking place with more than 40 countries about the possibility of forming a war crimes tribunal. He indicated that a decision on the format of the panel this year would be \u201ca powerful signal\u201d, but did not say more about when it could start. He said such a tribunal was likely to last several years once it began. Kostin and Grunskiene said investigators had managed to establish the identities of three people, all pro-Russian militants from the Donetsk region, suspected of killing Lithuanian film director Mantas Kvedaravicius in the city of Mariupol. Kvedaravicius\u2019 death was announced by Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry in April 2022. Kostin on Thursday said the film director had died as a result of torture inflicted by the three suspects, including broken bones, knife wounds and a mock execution. The director was filming a documentary showing the suffering of Mariupol\u2019s residents during a brutal, months-long siege of the city by advancing Russian forces. The documentary, Mariupolis 2, was released several months after his death. Ukraine\u2019s first lady, Olena Zelenska, met some well-known British faces during her visit to the UK. The Polish prime minister said the country won\u2019t rule out introducing a ban on agricultural products from Russia during a visit to Warsaw. Like much of Europe, Poland has been gripped by protests in recent weeks as farmers demonstrate against EU environmental regulations and what they say is unfair competition from Ukraine since the bloc waived duties on imports in 2022. However, Polish prime minister Donald Tusk said agricultural products from Russia and Belarus were also causing market distortions. Tusk told a news conference: Latvia decided to implement an embargo on the import of [agricultural] products from Russia. We will analyse the case of Latvia, and I do not rule out that Poland will take an appropriate initiative. Tusk said the EU needed to \u201cseriously focus on better regulations when it comes to the import of cereals and food products from the east\u201d. Tusk is due to meet the farmers\u2019 leaders later on Thursday. Ukraine\u2019s military said on Thursday it had shot down three more Russian Su-34 fighter-bombers, the latest successes it has reported against Moscow\u2019s air force. On Telegram, army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said: After successful combat operations against an enemy aircraft in the night on Feb. 29, two more Russian aircraft were destroyed: Su-34 fighter-bombers in the Avdiivka and Mariupol sectors. Russia, which began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago, did not immediately comment on Syrskyi\u2019s remarks. Reuters could not immediately verify his comments. Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine fell to Russian forces this month after a long battle. Russia took full control of the south-eastern port city of Mariupol in May 2022. The Ukrainian military said last week that Russia had lost six warplanes in three days, Reuters reports. Russian business people should invest in Russia and their assets and property rights should be protected, president Vladimir Putin said on Thursday during his annual address. He said that taxes for small and medium-sized businesses in Russia should be reduced, Reuters reports. A Russian court on Thursday rejected an appeal by a Russian-American woman against her detention on a treason charge. The FSB Security Service said last week that Ksenia Karelina had been detained on suspicion of raising funds for Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. The Los Angeles resident had been collecting funds for a Ukrainian organisation whose ultimate beneficiary was the Ukrainian army, the FSB said. A Russian lawyers\u2019 group said she had donated just over $50 to a charity that sends aid to Ukraine. Sri Lanka has decided to stop issuing free long-term visas to Russian and Ukrainian nationals who have lived in the Indian Ocean island nation for the past two years, a government official said on Thursday. Since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Sri Lanka has allowed Russians and Ukrainians to stay in the country without paying for visas, but they will now have to pay the charges. The rate is about $50 for a 30-day visa, if they wish to stay in Sri Lanka, public security minister Tiran Alles told Reuters. \u201cWhoever wants to stay back can apply for new visas,\u201d Alles added. \u201cThey can immediately renew their visas and remain here.\u201d Last week immigration authorities said they were ending the free long-term visa scheme for Russian and Ukraine nationals, setting a 7 March deadline for the departure of those without new visas in a notice that sparked comment on social media. About 300 to 400 Russians and Ukrainians are estimated to have been staying in Sri Lanka since February 2022, said Priantha Fernando, the chairman of the island\u2019s tourism body. \u201cThis has nothing to do with normal tourists,\u201d Fernando said. \u201cWe are more than welcoming them \u2026 there is no issue.\u201d Here are some images from the news wires of Putin during his state of the nation address: Russian president Vladimir Putin said he believes it is important for Russia to strengthen ties with Arab countries and Latin American countries during his annual address to the nation. Here is some more background about Putin\u2019s state-of-the-nation address: It comes two weeks ahead of a presidential election, in which Putin is expected to win another six-year term in a landslide. It was delivered to members of both Houses of Parliament, state officials, military commanders and soldiers. He covered the war in Ukraine, threat of Nato expansion, Russian nuclear capabilities, the declining birthrate and support for large families. More from the speech to come \u2026 Putin also said Russia will fight back and \u201cdefeat\u201d Nato on their own territory against the threat of expansion, which he warned could trigger a nuclear war. He said: They are preparing to strike our territory and using the best possible forces most effective forces to do so. But we remember the fate of those who tried to invade our territory and of course their fate will be much more tragic than anything that we could face. They have to understand that we also have weapons. Weapons that can defeat them on their own territory and of course all this is very dangerous because it could actually trigger the use of nuclear weapons. Do they not understand that? These people are people who have not been through arduous experiences. They\u2019ve forgotten about it, but we did through the Caucasian war, for example, and now in the conflict in Ukraine. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said the west are attempting to \u201cdestroy us\u201d and to \u201ccontain our development\u201d in his annual address to parliament. He said: The so called West with its so colonialist tendencies is striving not only to contain our development but they are intent on destroying us and using our space for whatever their purposes are including Ukraine. They are absolutely determined to introduce division among us and weaken us \u2026 Citizens of Russia will defend our freedom and independence. It is only down to you that our way will be determined for the future. Ukrainian forces have pushed back Russian troops from the village of Orlivka, west of Avdiivka, but the situation on the eastern front remains difficult, Ukrainian army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Thursday. Orlivka is less than 2 kilometres northwest of Lastochkyne, which was recently occupied by Russian forces. Russian forces last week captured the strategic eastern Ukrainian city of Avdiivka after a months-long assault and are pressing on several other areas along the frontline, Ukrainian authorities say. Ukraine\u2019s military said this week it had withdrawn from two more villages near Avdiivka, losing more territory as support from its western allies runs short. On Telegram, Syrskyi said: The enemy continues active offensive actions in many areas of the frontline. The situation is particularly tense in the Avdiivka and Zaporizhzhia sectors. He said Russian assault units were trying to break through the Ukrainian defences and capture the settlements of Tonenke, Orlivka, Semenivka, Berdychi and Krasnohorivka. Syrskyi, who visited troops on the eastern front, said some commanders had revealed certain shortcomings in their \u201csituational awareness and assessment of the enemy\u201d, which directly affected the sustainability of defence in certain areas. I took all measures to remedy the situation on the ground, with the allocation of additional ammunition and material resources, as well as the necessary reserves. Ukraine plans to export a high volume of electricity on Thursday, taking advantage of lower domestic consumption during a spell of mild weather, the energy ministry said. The country\u2019s electricity exports, which began shortly before it was invaded by Russian troops in 2022, were halted after numerous Russian attacks on power infrastructure and the seizure of the largest nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia. However, Ukraine has exported significant volumes of power to eastern Europe this month. A ministry statement said: For the current day, electricity imports are forecast to total 2,497 megawatt hours (MWh) while exports are expected to reach 4,797 MWh. Ukraine has been experiencing a surplus of electricity for three days and the surplus was transferred to Poland. Energy minister German Galushchenko last month told Reuters that Ukraine could resume substantial energy exports as early as this spring because of lower domestic consumption. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It has just passed 10am in Kyiv. Here are the latest developments: Several members of Ukrainian special forces have died in an assault on the Tendra Spit in Kherson oblast, according to reports. Ukraine\u2019s special operations forces confirmed the deaths, suggesting those who died had stayed behind to ensure the main contingent escaped. Russia claimed on Thursday that its forces had re-entered the village of Robotyne, which Ukraine retook from the occupiers in August 2023. Russia\u2019s state-run Interfax news agency cited the defence ministry saying troops had taken over some buildings but it was unclear whether Ukrainian troops had completely withdrawn. There was no confirmation from reliable sources. Robotyne lies between Avdiivka and Kherson, and south-east of Zaporizhzhia, on the frontline in Zaporizhzhia oblast. Ukraine\u2019s forces shot down 10 Russian aircraft in as many days with the latest being two Russian Su-34 fighter-bombers on 27 February, according to the Ukrainian general staff. The UK government said on Wednesday that how Ukraine uses donated cruise missiles is \u201cthe business of the armed forces of Ukraine\u201d after comments by Germany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, about possible UK and French involvement in targeting, and how Germany would not get involved in similar activity by sending its Taurus missiles. The Russian defence ministry claimed through state media on Wednesday that its forces had captured Petrovske, formerly renamed by Ukraine as Stepove, in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry on Wednesday cautioned against any meddling from Russia in Moldova\u2019s neighbouring breakaway region of Transnistria, whose separatist leaders have supposedly appealed to Moscow for \u201cprotection\u201d \u2013 a ploy that has previously been instigated by Russia to justify invading other countries. Moldova\u2019s government has called the Transnistrian separatists\u2019 request a propaganda event. Transnistria is a primarily Russian-speaking region that is legally part of Moldova. In February 2022 leading up to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian-backed militants in Ukraine also asked for Moscow\u2019s \u201cprotection\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has promoted the idea of joint arms production at a summit of south-eastern European countries in the Albanian capital, Tirana. Zelenskiy proposed a Ukrainian-Balkans defence forum in Kyiv or a Balkan capital, similar to initiatives held last year with British and US weapons companies. A joint declaration signed by 10 countries at the summit said their leaders were ready to take part in a Ukrainian-led peace summit in Switzerland this spring to discuss Zelenskiy\u2019s vision of peace. Albania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Romania are Nato members, have joined western sanctions against Russia, and sent arms and equipment to Ukraine. There are significant arms industries in parts of the Balkans left over from the former Yugoslavia. Serbia has not imposed sanctions on Russia, and neither Belgrade nor Kyiv recognise the independence of Kosovo, an Albanian enclave that claims independence, backs Ukraine and seeks EU and Nato membership. The EU should consider using profits from frozen Russian assets to buy military supplies for Ukraine, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Wednesday. Japan has backed the idea, saying the EU proposals appear to have a basis in international law. Poland\u2019s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said his government was considering a \u201ctemporary\u201d closure of the border with Ukraine for goods, amid tensions over low-priced Ukrainian grain. \u201cWe are talking with the Ukrainian side about a temporary closure of the border, the cessation in general of trade.\u201d However, Oleksandr Kubrakov, Ukrainian deputy PM, said: \u201cUkraine is not going to close its borders with Poland. No one from the Ukrainian side is negotiating about this. Our people are fighting for their existence in a war with the Russian aggressor. For us, a stable border is a matter of survival.\u201d Ensuring Ukraine\u2019s success against Russia is \u201cthe biggest test of our generation\u201d, UK Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell said on Wednesday. He added: \u201cAt the G20 foreign ministers meeting it was clear there are few illusions about what Russia is doing and that the UN and Britain underlined how dangerous Putin\u2019s actions are for the entire world.\u201d Russian forces struck 11 communities along the Sumy oblast border in 42 separate attacks on Wednesday, the regional military administration reported according to the Kyiv Independent. No casualties or damage to local infrastructure were reported. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov will attend a diplomacy forum in Turkey from Friday, the countries\u2019 governments said. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Lavrov would meet Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan. A court in southern Russia jailed a Ukrainian man for 11 years and six months after convicting him of espionage for trying to procure secret missile components for Ukraine, Russian news agencies reported on Wednesday. China\u2019s Eurasia envoy, Li Hui, will visit Russia, Ukraine and the headquarters of the EU this week for talks. The trip will represent \u201cthe second round of shuttle diplomacy on seeking a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis\u201d, China\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement, adding Li would also go to France, Germany and Poland."

            "title": "Barbican backs away from hosting talk about Gaza war",
            "date": "2024-02-06T17:20:47Z",
            "content": "The London Review of Books has expressed its disappointment after the Barbican backed out of hosting a lecture series which included a talk about the Holocaust and allegations that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. The Guardian understands the Barbican was planning to host the event until an advert in the LRB revealed that the title of the talk by the writer Pankaj Mishra was The Shoah after Gaza. Senior leadership then decided to withdraw from the arrangement. The Barbican said no official agreement to host the talk was in place and that it backed away after the event was publicised \u201cprematurely\u201d. The organisation claimed the LRB\u2019s decision to advertise the event meant it did not have time to \u201cdo the careful preparation needed for this sensitive content\u201d. \u201cWe carefully consider the content of all screenings, performances, talks and exhibitions hosted by the Barbican before agreeing to host them,\u201d it said. A description of Mishra\u2019s talk on the LRB website reads: \u201cA powerful western narrative holds the Shoah to be the incomparable crime of the modern era. But we find our moral and political consciousness profoundly altered when Israel, a country founded as a haven for the victims of genocidal racism, is itself charged with genocide. \u201cWhat is the fate of universal values after Israel\u2019s collapse into violent nationalism?\u201d In a statement, the LRB said: \u201cWe were disappointed that the Barbican withdrew from hosting the lectures at a late stage but are glad that this important series is going ahead at St James church, Clerkenwell.\u201d Mishra criticised the Barbican\u2019s decision, saying a \u201cpervasive sense of fear and panic\u201d is closing down debate on the issue within cultural spaces. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised but it\u2019s still shocking,\u201d Mishra said. \u201cThe whole point of culture and the arts is to embrace diversity, different view points and protect imaginative freedom. \u201cIt\u2019s become clear that war crimes have been committed on a daily basis and powerful people who have supported the Israeli regime are doubling down on their untenable position. That breeds a pervasive sense of fear and panic that infects even cultural institutions.\u201d Dr Toby Simpson, the director of the Wiener Holocaust Library, said the Barbican\u2019s decision not to host the talk was not necessarily a sign of panic. He said: \u201cThere has always been a need for sensitivity when dealing with the Holocaust, due to its unprecedented scale, complexity and shocking inhumanity. \u201cCultural institutions have a right to expect that speakers are sensitive to racism. This is increasingly the case, which is a good thing.\u201d Simpson said there was a widespread failure to acknowledge antisemitism and its legacies today, especially on the left of the political spectrum, and that was \u201clikely to have played a role in the Barbican\u2019s decision\u201d. The LRB\u2019s winter lecture series is a long-running fixture in London\u2019s literary calendar and was held at the British Museum until the Covid-19 pandemic. The three lectures in the 2024 series will be given by Mishra; Hazel V Carby, professor emeritus of African American studies at Yale University; and the writer Terry Eagleton. The Barbican was forced to apologise last year after it was accused of censorship when it asked a Palestinian speaker to avoid discussing \u201cfree Palestine\u201d at length during an event in June. It described the decision as unacceptable and \u201ca serious error of judgment\u201d, for which it was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d. It has since hosted the London Palestine film festival, in November. In 2021, the Barbican was accused of being \u201cinstitutionally racist\u201d by its own staff, who detailed incidents of abuse and criticised leadership\u2019s response to the Black Lives Matter movement. The fallout led to the resignation of Sir Nicholas Kenyon after 14 years in charge, then its new director, Will Gompertz, left after only two years in the post, announcing the move in August 2023."

            "content": "Russian drones and S-300 missiles attacked Ukraine over Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, Ukraine\u2019s air force said. All 10 drones were shot down, said the air force. It did not say whether the missiles reached their targets. A day earlier, Ukrainian forces shot down a Russian Su-34 fighter jet on the eastern front, air force commander Mykola Oleshchuk said. Ukraine\u2019s troops withdrew from the villages of Severne and Stepove near the eastern town of Avdiika, recently captured by Russian forces, military spokesperson Dmytro Lykhoviy said. The general staff said Ukrainian forces undertook airstrikes on Russian positions in the settlement of Krasnohorivka near Avdiivka. Around Avdiikva, recently captured by Russian invasion troops, heavy fighting was reported on the eastern side of Orlivka and just north of Tonen\u2019ke; while east of Semenivka, Ukrainian troops were using mines and artillery against advancing Russian armour. In the Zaporizhzhia oblast, Ukrainian forces reportedly fought off assaults around Malynivka and Robotyne. Ukraine is expected to remain short of ammunition and on the back foot in its war with Russia for several months until the west sorts out further support, Adm Sir Tony Radakin, the head of Britain\u2019s armed forces, has said. The US president, Joe Biden, met congressional leaders in the White House on Tuesday for talks on the Ukraine aid bill, in a meeting described by the Democrats\u2019 Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, as intense. Biden said of Ukraine aid: \u201cThe need is urgent \u2026 the consequences of inaction every day in Ukraine are dire.\u201d Mike Johnson \u2013 the Republican speaker of the House, who has been blocking further consideration of Ukraine aid, did not mention the topic in brief remarks outside the West Wing afterwards. He talked about security of the Mexico border and continued funding of the government, as well as a one-on-one with Biden. Republican hardliners have presented themselves as being focused on securing the border from illegal immigrants ahead of further help for Ukraine, despite having negotiated and then rejected legislation that deals with both. Several European countries and the US said they were not considering sending ground troops to Ukraine after France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, refused to rule it out. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, went so far as to say there was agreement at the Paris Ukraine conference on Monday \u201cthat there will be no ground troops, no soldiers on Ukrainian soil\u201d sent by European states or Nato states. The French foreign minister, St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, in an address to the French parliament, said: \u201cWe must consider new actions to support Ukraine. These must respond to very specific needs, I am thinking in particular of mine clearance, cyber, the production of weapons on site, on Ukrainian territory. Some of these actions could require a presence on Ukrainian territory, without crossing the threshold of belligerence. Nothing should be excluded. This was and still is the position today of the president of the republic.\u201d France\u2019s prime minister, Gabriel Attal, also said nothing was off the table in western efforts to prevent a Russian victory in Ukraine. \u201cNo dynamic can be ruled out. We will do whatever it takes to ensure that Russia cannot win this war,\u201d he said. The Kremlin suggested that conflict between Russia and Nato would become inevitable if European members of Nato fought in Ukraine. Janet Yellen, the US secretary of the treasury, has called for G7 countries to urgently seize profits from Russian assets frozen in the west and redirect them to Ukraine. \u201cThere is a strong international law, economic, and moral case for moving forward. This would be a decisive response to Russia\u2019s unprecedented threat to global stability.\u201d Two police officers were killed and four were injured by Russian shelling in the northern Ukrainian region of Sumy, Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, said. Klymenko wrote on Telegram that an investigative team was deliberately fired upon while documenting damage caused by an earlier Russian strike. North Korea has shipped about 6,700 containers carrying millions of munitions to Russia since July to support Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, South Korean media reported on Tuesday. South Korea\u2019s defence minister, Shin Won-sik, said the containers might carry more than 3 million 152mm artillery shells, or 500,000 122mm rounds. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine\u2019s president, arrived in Albania on Tuesday ahead of the \u201cUkraine-Southeast Europe Summit\u201d on security. Albania\u2019s foreign minister, Igli Hasani, said Albania was \u201cstanding in solidarity with Ukraine in its heroic fight against Russia\u2019s aggression\u201d. Albania, a Nato member since 2009, has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine but has been quieter in public about supplying it with arms."

            "date": "2024-02-21T19:37:38Z",
            "content": "On Wednesday lunchtime Keir Starmer was facing the biggest crisis of his career. Earlier in the week, he had been warned that as many as 100 of his MPs \u2013 including at least two of his shadow cabinet \u2013 were willing to rebel by voting for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza unless Labour brought forward its own amendment calling for one. Having agreed to publish exactly such an amendment, the Labour leader now faced another hurdle: the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, was being advised not to pick it and instead call a different one from the government. Hours away from the biggest rebellion of his leadership, Starmer decided to intervene personally and visited Hoyle in his office behind the House of Commons chamber. Those briefed on the meeting said the Labour leader warned Hoyle that Labour MPs\u2019 security was at risk. Many had been deluged by criticisms, threats and abuse since abstaining on a similar SNP motion in November. With hundreds of protesters congregating outside parliament, they worried worse might be to come. After a tense meeting, and with Labour MPs desperately stalling inside the chamber, Hoyle eventually agreed. As the Gaza debate started, the speaker announced he would call both the Labour and government amendments, prompting fury on the government and SNP benches and huge relief on the Labour ones. After a dramatic day in parliament, the speaker\u2019s standing, at least on the government\u2019s benches, had been left badly damaged. Starmer, however, had pulled off a political coup, eventually avoiding any rebellion at all after the government decided to pull out entirely from the evening\u2019s votes. \u201cWe came minutes away from disaster,\u201d said one senior Labour official. \u201cThank God for Lindsay Hoyle.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s parliamentary action was the culmination of weeks of wrangling on the Labour benches, as MPs petitioned the Labour leader to change tack on Gaza while his advisers warned him against stepping out of line with the perceived international consensus. The last ceasefire vote in November had triggered the biggest rebellion of Starmer\u2019s tenure, with 56 Labour MPs defying orders to vote for the SNP motion including 10 frontbenchers. Since then, many of those MPs who stayed loyal have faced protests outside their constituency offices and even their homes. Their arguments about parliamentary process and the difference between a ceasefire and Labour\u2019s proposal of a \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d proved ineffective as the death toll in Gaza mounted. Meanwhile, Starmer\u2019s position was changing. He began to argue for an immediate end to the violence and a \u201cceasefire that lasts\u201d. But as he travelled to the Munich Security Conference last week alongside his shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the shadow defence secretary, John Healey, he was under pressure to go further and argue explicitly for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d. As Starmer, Lammy and Healey met international leaders and well-connected diplomats in Munich, they realised international opinion was beginning to shift. With the Israelis beginning to threaten Rafah, western countries were becoming more robust in their calls for an end to the fighting. A turning point came last Thursday, when Australia, Canada and New Zealand published a joint statement urging an \u201cimmediate humanitarian ceasefire\u201d, which gave the Labour leader cover to use the same language. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate how significant that was,\u201d said one senior Labour official. \u201cHaving our Five Eyes partners call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire definitely helped shape our thinking.\u201d But as Starmer returned to Westminster on Monday he had still not decided what form of words to propose in an alternative to the SNP motion. Frontbenchers, led by the shadow justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, were dispatched to warn him that anything less than a call for an immediate ceasefire would trigger a massive rebellion. \u201cMany MPs who remained loyal to him last time told him they couldn\u2019t do so again unless they were allowed to vote for an immediate ceasefire,\u201d said one Labour source. \u201cThe situation on the ground has only got worse since then, as has the pressure on ordinary members.\u201d Starmer was persuaded, and on Tuesday afternoon his whips published their amendment which called for an \u201cimmediate humanitarian ceasefire\u201d before laying out exactly in what circumstances one could be expected to happen. The trouble was not yet over for the Labour leader, however. During a meeting in parliament, Starmer and Lammy took shadow ministers through their reasoning. But elsewhere on the estate, shadow foreign minister Wayne David endured a much tougher time as he explained the new position to backbenchers. Several MPs, including Jess Phillips, who resigned in November as a shadow minister to vote with the SNP, and the backbenchers Sam Tarry and Paul Blomfield, criticised the leadership. Some were angry that the new amendment had too many caveats. Many others were furious about how long it had taken to get the party to take the position it was now taking, and how many had seen their careers damaged in the meantime. \u201cThe frontbench took an absolute battering,\u201d said one person who attended the meeting. Starmer had an even bigger problem. Labour officials predicted correctly that the government would publish its own amendment to the SNP motion, which under parliamentary precedent would trump the Labour one. If Labour MPs were not able to vote for their own amendment calling for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d, dozens were still willing to vote for the SNP motion. Labour MPs launched a frantic lobbying campaign aimed at the speaker. Unless Hoyle allowed the Labour amendment to come to a vote, they said, he would be forcing them to remain loyal to their party or put their own safety at risk. Several told him of the threats they had faced since abstaining on the SNP motion last time. The party denied reports that Labour whips had even threatened to lead an effort to deselect him as speaker if he did not call the Labour amendment. Starmer\u2019s last-minute intervention proved crucial. Finally, Hoyle entered the chamber and announced his decision to abandon precedent and call both the Labour and the government amendments. The Tory and SNP benches erupted in anger, while shadow ministers slumped in relief. The debate eventually began around an hour after it was expected. Five hours later, the Labour amendment passed easily with no resistance from the government. Starmer had averted disaster and emerged stronger. \u201cWe came very close to a huge rebellion,\u201d said one Labour source. \u201cBut in the end Starmer\u2019s authority is stronger than it was before today.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-13T17:32:11Z",
            "content": "Israel and Hamas are making progress towards a deal that would bring about a ceasefire and free hostages held in the Gaza Strip, officials with knowledge of the talks have said. The US national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, speaking as negotiations were held in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, said: \u201cThey\u2019ve been constructive and moving in the right direction.\u201d The talks came as calls grew for Israel not to go ahead with a planned assault on the territory\u2019s southernmost city, Rafah, crammed with more than a million displaced people. Israel has faced a mounting wave of international criticism for its conduct of the war in Gaza and for settler violence in the occupied West Bank. Calling Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza \u201cdisproportionate\u201d, the Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said there were \u201ctoo many victims\u201d in Gaza, as South Africa \u2013 which has lodged a genocide complaint against Israel at the international court of justice \u2013 returned to the ICJ to demand it take action over recent attacks on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. On Tuesday, France became the latest country \u2013 after the US and the UK \u2013 to announce it was imposing sanctions against several dozen Israeli settlers involved in violent acts targeting Palestinians. Israeli tanks shelled the eastern sector of Rafah, while Gaza health officials said an Israeli strike on a house in Nusseirat refugee camp in central Gaza killed 16 people. Late on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces released a video that it said showed Hamas\u2019s chief in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, and his family, being led through a tunnel. The black and white footage filmed on 10 October is said to be the first images of Sinwar to emerge since the unprecedented 7 October attack on Israel, which he is accused of masterminding. As the talks in Cairo got under way there were reports that the CIA director, William Burns, was flying in to join teams from Hamas and Israel for negotiations over a ceasefire and prisoner exchange as international pressure increases to advance the talks. Israel\u2019s delegation includes its heads of intelligence, David Barnea of the Mossad and Ronen Bar, the director of Shin Bet. Also attending are the Egyptian intelligence director, Abbas Kamel, and the Qatari prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani. A senior Egyptian official said the meeting would focus on crafting a final draft of a six-week ceasefire deal, with guarantees that the parties would continue negotiations toward a permanent ceasefire amid suggestions of progress. Egypt\u2019s intelligence agency has acted as a significant interlocutor in past conflicts between Hamas and Israel, while Burns\u2019s presence is seen as underlining US pressure for an end to hostilities. A US official, quoted in the New York Times, said Burns was travelling to Cairo after Joe Biden said on Monday that he was pressing for a deal including a ceasefire of at least six weeks in exchange for the release of the remaining hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. The hostages were seized in the 7 October raid on southern Israel by Hamas militants, which killed 1,200 people and triggered Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza. Securing their return is a priority for the government of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, along with eradicating Hamas, which controls Gaza. \u201cThe key element of the deals are on the table,\u201d Biden told journalists at a briefing alongside the visiting Jordanian king, Abdullah II. \u201cThere are gaps that remain, but I\u2019ve encouraged Israeli leaders to keep working to achieve the deal,\u201d he said, adding that Israel should not launch a ground offensive into the southern Gaza city of Rafah without a \u201ccredible plan\u201d to safeguard the 1.4 million displaced civilians sheltering there. Israel\u2019s suggestion that it will attack Rafah next has triggered widespread international opposition, with a senior UN official on Tuesday saying that the UN would not participate in a forced evacuation. A western diplomat in the Egyptian capital also said a six-week deal was on the table but cautioned that more work was needed to reach an agreement. Netanyahu has publicly insisted on a hardline position, saying Israel would continue its offensive until total victory. However, behind the scenes, officials have suggested that progress was being made in negotiations for a second, longer ceasefire, according to two officials with direct knowledge of the talks. Talks are moving forward even after Israel intensified its offensive in Rafah. An Israeli hostage rescue mission freed two captives held in the town along the Egyptian border, in a raid that killed at least 74 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and left a trail of destruction. A deal would give people in Gaza a desperately needed respite from the war, now in its fifth month, and offer freedom for at least some of the 100-plus hostages. Efforts to bring about a deal have so been hobbled by the disparate positions of Hamas and Israel. Israel has proposed a two-month ceasefire, in which hostages would be freed in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, and top Hamas leaders in Gaza would be allowed to move to other countries. Hamas rejected those terms and has laid out a three-phase plan of 45 days each in which the hostages would be released in stages, Israel would free hundreds of imprisoned Palestinians, including senior militants, and the war would be wound down, with Israel withdrawing its troops. A deal in late November brought about a brief truce allowing the release of about 100 hostages in Gaza in exchange for about 240 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The threatened Israeli offensive against Rafah has triggered mounting alarm among those who have sought shelter in the city. Samah, a mother-of-two who is a senior programme officer for ActionAid, said she was sharing a tent with 20 family members in Rafah after her home in Gaza City was destroyed. \u201cThey [the IDF] asked us to go outside Gaza City to the south so we went to Khan Younis. We spent two months in Khan Younis and after that they told us we have to be evacuated to Rafah. She said people in Rafah are terrified at the prospect of an all-out military assault on the town where 1.3 million are sheltering. \u201cIt\u2019s very scary. It would be a disaster, more than the disaster that we are already living in. Most of Gaza\u2019s people are in Rafah now. There are a lot of people here in tents and we don\u2019t know where we can evacuate,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2024-02-20T16:16:31Z",
            "content": "The US has vetoed a UN security council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza for the third time, arguing that it would undermine negotiations over a hostage deal. The US was the lone vote against a ceasefire resolution put forward on Tuesday by Algeria. The UK was the sole abstention, with 13 votes in support, including those of close allies of Washington who insisted the humanitarian needs of Palestinians outweighed any reservations over the Algerian text. Washington was widely lambasted for using its veto again at a time when nearly 30,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 2 million people are under threat of famine. \u201cA vote in favour of this draft resolution is a support for the Palestinians right to life,\u201d the Algerian envoy to the UN, Amar Bendjama, told the council. \u201cConversely, voting against it implies an endorsement of the brutal violence and collective punishment inflicted upon them.\u201d The Algerian resolution also called for the implementation of provisional measures ordered in January by the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague, which instructed Israel to mitigate its offensive to protect civilians, lift impediments on the flow of aid into Gaza, and take action against Israeli politicians using genocidal language. \u201cAlmost one month after the ICJ [ruling] signs of hope are still absent for improvement of the situation in Gaza,\u201d Bendjama said. \u201cSilence \u2026 is not a viable option. Now is the time for action and the time for truth.\u201d Zhang Jun, the Chinese ambassador, said: \u201cThe continued passive avoidance of an immediate ceasefire is no different from giving a green light to the continued slaughter.\u201d The US has drafted an alternative resolution, which calls for a temporary ceasefire \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d, and calls on Israel not to proceed with a planned offensive on Rafah, the southernmost Gazan city where more than a million Palestinians have sought refuge. However, the US resolution is not likely to go to a vote for several days at least, and the timing of its third ceasefire veto is embarrassing for the US as Washington seeks to build international solidarity in condemnation of Russia on the second anniversary later this week of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Explaining the veto, the US envoy, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said that Joe Biden was in the midst of negotiations with Israel, Egypt and Qatar aimed at clinching a comprehensive hostage deal. \u201cAny action this council takes right now should help, not hinder these sensitive and ongoing negotiations, and we believe that the resolution on the table right now would in fact negatively impact those negotiations,\u201d Thomas-Greenfield argued. \u201cDemanding an immediate unconditional ceasefire without an agreement requiring Hamas to release the hostages will not bring about durable peace. Instead, it could extend the fighting between Hamas and Israel,\u201d she added, later denouncing the 13 to one vote for the Algerian resolution as \u201cwishful and irresponsible\u201d. Thomas-Greenfield looked on stony-faced as a series of Washington allies including France, Slovenia and Switzerland explained their reasons for voting for the resolution, despite sharing the US\u2019s reservation that it did not include any condemnation of Hamas, something the security council has so far failed to do. They all argued the humanitarian disaster in Gaza was so dire that stopping the fighting took precedence over such concerns. Nicolas de Rivi\u00e8re, the French envoy, said Paris regretted that \u201cthe resolution was not adopted given the disastrous situation on the ground\u201d. The only vote sparing the US from total isolation was the British abstention. The ambassador, Barbara Woodward, said the UK position was to call for an \u201cimmediate suspension in fighting to get aid in and hostages out leading to a permanent sustainable ceasefire\u201d. But Woodward echoed Thomas-Greenfield\u2019s arguments in adding: \u201cSimply calling for a ceasefire, as this resolution does, will not make it happen. Indeed, it could endanger the hostage negotiations. It could actually make a ceasefire less likely.\u201d The US showed its alternative draft to other council members before Tuesday\u2019s vote. This unusual step was intended, one western diplomat suggested, to avoid giving the impression that the US veto implied a green light for the Israeli attack on Rafah. The inclusion in the US text of a clause specifically calling on Israel not to mount such an attack, rather than to limit such an appeal to bilateral channels, is widely seen in the UN as a signal of Biden\u2019s growing impatience with Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government, and frustration at the US president\u2019s failure to rein in the relentless Gaza offensive, now in its fifth month. No date has yet been set for the start of formal deliberations on the US draft resolution, however. \u201cIt is awfully embarrassing for the Americans,\u201d Richard Gowan, the UN director of the International Crisis Group, said. \u201cThey\u2019ve had to use a veto just days before the security council meeting commemorating Russia\u2019s all-out assault on Ukraine. That will simply fuel talk about US double standards.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-17T17:59:42Z",
            "content": "Labour is hoping to defuse a fresh crisis over Keir Starmer\u2019s cautious stance on Gaza by rewording a Scottish National party motion calling for an immediate ceasefire. With the support of Scotland\u2019s first minister, Humza Yousaf, the SNP will table a motion to be debated in the Commons on Wednesday, which intends to challenge Starmer by calling for an immediate end to the violence. Labour is desperate to avoid a repeat of last November\u2019s sizeable rebellion by MPs over Starmer\u2019s stance, which saw 56 Labour MPs back a similar SNP motion and three shadow spokespeople resign. In an attempt to crank up the pressure on Starmer, Stephen Flynn, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, published an open letter to Labour backbenchers urging them to back their fresh motion. \u201cFor more than four months, the UK has followed the strategy of equivocation supported by Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer,\u201d Flynn\u2019s letter stated. \u201cThe devastation shows it hasn\u2019t worked. The time for equivocation is over.\u201d He released it as Scottish Labour\u2019s leader, Anas Sarwar, who has previously been highly critical of Starmer\u2019s early caution, endorsed a motion at the party\u2019s annual conference in Glasgow on Saturday that explicitly called for an immediate ceasefire on both sides. Speaking to delegates on Friday, Sarwar said he believed the \u201cfighting must stop\u201d, adding: \u201cThat means an immediate ceasefire with an end to rocket fire going in to, and coming out of, Gaza right now. \u201cIt means the immediate release of hostages; immediate access to humanitarian aid [and] crucially, immediate efforts by world leaders to forge a path to an enduring peace and a two-state solution.\u201d Starmer has repeatedly avoided using the word \u201cimmediate\u201d and has instead called for a \u201csustainable\u201d ceasefire, perhaps to avoid the risk that Hamas and its Islamist allies in Gaza will fail to adhere to it, leaving Labour to appear naive. Yet he has edged closer to Sarwar\u2019s position recently. In an interview with Sky on the sidelines of the Munich security conference on Saturday, Starmer confirmed his aides were studying the SNP motion to see if a deal could be struck. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to look at the precise wording. But I\u2019m very clear that we all want a ceasefire. The question therefore is how do we get there?\u201d With pro-Palestinian campaigners protesting outside the conference venue, Sarwar told reporters in Glasgow there was little difference between Labour and the SNP, or between him and Starmer, over the need for an urgent end to the violence. He said Labour whips and Ian Murray, the shadow Scottish secretary, wanted talks with Flynn in an effort to draft a motion Labour could endorse. \u201cIt looks like a pretty decent motion,\u201d Sarwar said. \u201cIf we can send a unified message from the UK parliament then we should take that opportunity and I hope people will engage in good faith in trying to find that unified position. \u201cIn the end, that is more important than two political parties having a go at each other when in actual fact what matters is the people living in Israel and Palestine who are fearing for their lives.\u201d Yousaf said the onus was on Labour to make its position on Gaza clear. \u201cThe real proof of the pudding will be what UK Labour chooses to do when the SNP brings a vote for a ceasefire once again to the House of Commons,\u201d he said. One Scottish Labour councillor was cheered by delegates when he said the conference \u201cdemanded\u201d that Scottish Labour\u2019s two MPs back the ceasefire motion next week. Pauline McNeill, one of Sarwar\u2019s allies and his justice spokesperson at Holyrood, said fighting for an independent Palestinian state was \u201cthe moral question of our time. Labour must not only call for the two-state solution, we must fight for the two-state solution.\u201d"

Lindsay Hoyle went against convention by selecting the amendment for a vote as well as a government one. He has since come under pressure over his handling of the original Scottish National party motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Tory and SNP MPs accused him of bowing to pressure from Keir Starmer to allow the Labour motion, which was passed. Hoyle said later he had been persuaded to allow both amendments because of \u201cabsolutely frightening\u201d threats to the personal safety of many MPs. The events were criticised by British Palestinians. Mira Hammad, 32, a British-Palestinian barrister, said the way the situation unfolded was \u201cdespicable\u201d. \u201cTo hear it being blamed on Palestine protesters, and the idea that people protesting for Palestine are dangerous or a threat to MPs, is just really despicable,\u201d she said. \u201cPalestinian lives are not a political game. There are real people that are human beings, it\u2019s just disgusting to see this as a political game. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely disgusting that a conversation that should have been about the safety of an active population living under bombardment and undergoing a genocide has become about the safety of MPs due to legitimate protests.\u201d Hammad added: \u201cIt just shows us that the horrors that are unfolding in Gaza couldn\u2019t be further away from the concerns of the politicians in parliament.\u201d Kamel Hawwash, 62, a British-Palestinian academic, said: \u201cIt should have been quite simple. Those who believe there should be a ceasefire would have voted yes. Those who side with Israel would have voted no. It would have been a real measure of these MPs and their humanity and their morals. Unfortunately, it became a farce. It became chaos. \u201cI\u2019m against protests outside MPs\u2019 homes, but not outside their place of work or in their constituency offices. I think it\u2019s legitimate for constituents to express their dissatisfaction and dismay at the lack of urgency to stop the killings in Gaza.\u201d Sara Husseini, 40, the director of the British Palestinian Committee, said the leadership of both main parties were \u201cdetermined to shield Israel from any criticism or accountability at the expense of democracy in this country and the UK\u2019s legal and moral duties to the Palestinian people\u201d. \u201cBritish Palestinians, and the wider voting public, will not forget this,\u201d she added. Hadil Louz, 30, a PhD student at the University of St Andrews who was born in Gaza, said efforts to apply pressure on parliament to call for a ceasefire had been in vain. \u201cI\u2019m not watching the news any more. I just want to bring my family to safety. I really suffered from the UK attitude and the parliament attitude towards the ceasefire. And I protested in London, I protested in Dundee, I protested in St Andrews, and everything was in vain,\u201d she said. \u201cI appreciate the solidarity of the people who go to the streets asking for a ceasefire. I really appreciate their efforts going to the streets every Saturday and every week. I haven\u2019t found any support from the government. But I really felt the support of the people in the UK.\u201d"

The answer is \u201cInvestor-State Dispute Settlements\u201d, or ISDS, alternatively dubbed \u201clitigation terrorism\u201d by Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize-winning economist. ISDS is a corporate tribunal system, where a panel of unelected lawyers decides whether a company is owed compensation if the actions of national governments leave its assets \u201cstranded\u201d. In hearings, which are often held behind closed doors, ISDS documents, claims, awards, settlements \u2013 even the content of cases \u2013 need not be made public, regardless of any public-interest considerations. Last week the Guardian revealed how Odyssey Marine Exploration, a US-based subsea mineral extraction company, was using an ISDS panel to sue Mexico for $2.36bn (\u00a31.87bn) after the government moved to prevent it dredging off the Pacific coast. The company had obtained a 50-year concession over an area of sea floor off Baja California Sur, and sought a permit to mine phosphate in it. The area is a pristine breeding ground for giant grey whales and is also home to endangered sea turtles, octopus and the abalone mollusc. Odyssey said that its dredging would take place in a small area, with protection for sea creatures and measures to help \u201cregenerate\u201d the sea floor afterwards. But deep-sea phosphate mining entails risks of pollution, radiation and biodiversity loss, as well as damage to coastal livelihoods and communities. When Mexico turned down the permit \u2013 once in 2016, and again, definitively, in 2018, saying Odyssey \u201csought to uninterruptedly dredge the sea floor\u201d of a place \u201cthat constitutes a natural treasure and of utmost importance for Mexico and the world\u201d \u2013 the company took it to an ISDS arbitration tribunal, arguing it was owed compensation for lost revenue. According to the Transnational Institute, there have been 1,383 known ISDS cases to date. These courts dish out the highest average claims for damages and the highest average awards of any legal system in the world. The panels are composed of three lawyers \u2013 one appointed by the investor, one by the state, and a president agreed by both. They are mostly white, male, business-friendly investment lawyers from the global north. And so far it is mostly investors who have been the system\u2019s beneficiaries, winning 61% of ISDS case decisions between 1987 and 2017, with an average award of $504m each. Fossil fuel magnates won 72% of their cases, shaking down governments for more than $77bn, according to the Transnational Institute. The three panellists often play more than one role within the ISDS system. So-called \u201crevolving door\u201d and \u201cdouble-hatting\u201d practices allow lawyers to work as arbitrators, presidents or experts for both investors and states \u2013 sometimes at the same time. This can create boundary issues when, for example, a lawyer acts as counsel for a fossil fuel investor in one ISDS case and, at the same time or thereabouts, \u201cdouble hats\u201d as the arbitrator (or president) in another ISDS case. Allowing foreign investors to help shape these panels creates \u201cobvious risks of bias, conflicts of interest, potential misconduct and other abuses of power\u201d, warned the UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, David Boyd, in a report in October last year. Indeed, oil companies helped to mould the ISDS system, which began in the 1960s as a way of protecting wealthy investors from the expropriation of their assets without compensation by newly independent ex-colonies. Investors argue that ISDS protects them from arbitrary, discriminatory or unpredictable treatment in countries that might lack independent or competent judiciaries. It safeguards their \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d of regulatory certainty, proportionality and profit. But investors and tribunals have also used this idea to preclude states \u201cfrom taking action to address climate change, despite these actions being necessary and foreseeable for decades\u201d, the UN report said. The sums involved have mushroomed and can be jaw-dropping. One Singapore-based company, Zeph Investments, is suing Australia for A$300bn (\u00a3155bn) because its government turned down a proposed mining project; the company argues Australia breached free-trade treaty obligations that it relied on. In another case, Avima Iron Ore is seeking $27bn from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Faced with such claims, often \u201cgovernments just capitulate,\u201d Boyd said. The result is a regulatory chill, in which fossil fuel companies may \u201cblock national legislation aimed at phasing out the use of their assets\u201d, as the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) noted. New Zealand backed off cancelling existing offshore oil permits due to ISDS fears in 2018. Denmark chose 2050 rather than an earlier date for its oil and gas production phase out deadline due to fears of \u201cincredibly expensive\u201d ISDS claims. In 2017, France diluted plans to phase out fossil fuel extraction by 2040 after threats of ISDS litigation from Vermilion, a Canadian multinational, according to the UN report. There are many other examples. The \u201cfundamental incompatibility\u201d between ISDS and climate imperatives poses a \u201cdaunting obstacle\u201d to effective and timely climate action, the UN report said. And therein lies the rub. We simply cannot extract any more fossil fuel and still prevent catastrophic global heating. Our remaining carbon budget will not allow it. Yet, by design, ISDS empowers oil, coal and gas barons to barricade progress until they have been paid off. Estimates of the eventual bill payable to hyperwealthy are as high as \u20ac1.3tn (\u00a31.1tn), but no one really knows. In the Mexican case, a court ruling could come later this year, but ISDS watchdogs are not optimistic about the result. Manuel P\u00e9rez-Rocha, an associate fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies in Washington, said that panel decisions until now had been \u201cso far, leaning in favour of the company\u201d. Helionor De Anzizu, a lawyer at the Center for International Environmental Law, also in the US capital, added that a court finding for Odyssey could trigger a free-for-all from other deep-sea investors looking to cash in with ISDS claims. Given that Mexico has already paid out $296m in ISDS suits, with 27 cases still pending according to the Transnational Institute, any associated regulatory chill could be severe. What is clear is that ISDS is a colonial zombie apparatus whose useful time, if it had one, has passed. It grew up riding legal shotgun against bids to suborn fossil fuel capitalism to social, national, environmental or human rights concerns. Now its legal guns are turned on any government seeking to meet the Paris climate agreement\u2019s 1.5C target without first paying a multibillion-dollar ransom. The thing is, we don\u2019t have the time or resources for this any longer. We can maintain a livable planet, or we can continue to allow the wealthiest, most antisocial financiers to hold the world to ransom. We cannot do both.

            "title": "Public left \u2018at risk\u2019 over UK counter-terrorism strategy, says Prevent review author ",
            "date": "2024-02-22T09:34:54Z",
            "content": "The author of a heavily criticised review of Britain\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy claims the public have been left \u201cat risk\u201d because many of his key recommendations have been ignored. In the review of Prevent for the Home Office last year, William Shawcross concluded that it had concentrated too much on the far-right and not enough on Islamist extremism. Shawcross told the BBC on Wednesday that Prevent was failing to identify terrorist sympathisers and that there was an increased risk in the UK due to the war in Gaza. Prevent gives public bodies a legal duty to identify people who may turn to extremism, and intervene. Shawcross was previously accused of failing to do the job properly after it was revealed he had attended only six of the review panels charged with examining the more extreme cases identified by Prevent. His comments coincided with the publication of a new report raising concerns that the data of people referred to the Prevent programme is being widely shared and retained for years, even when referrals are marked \u201cno further action\u201d. The study from the privacy and free speech organisation, Open Rights Group, also said there appeared to be a lack of oversight and parliamentary scrutiny over data sharing. It found the overwhelming majority of people subject to Prevent referrals did not meet the threshold for a de-radicalisation intervention, yet their data is being retained for at least six years \u2013 and up to 100 years. The data is being shared across multiple databases, with potentially harmful outcomes, the research found. Ministers published a progress report on Tuesday, on the anniversary of the publication of Shawcross\u2019s review, and said they had \u201cbrought Prevent back to its core mission\u201d. The home secretary, James Cleverly, said: \u201cThanks to the work undertaken in response to [Shawcross\u2019s] review, we have a first-class Prevent programme that can play a central role in this effort.\u201d Shawcross told the BBC that ministers had \u201cignored\u201d some of his key recommendations and that he thought \u201cas a result the public is at risk\u201d. The Home Office said it had implemented almost all of Shawcross\u2019s proposals and would eventually enact them all. Shawcross said: \u201cThe government has published a report saying that they have made some of those changes that I asked for, that I proposed \u2013 but not enough.\u201d He said he felt more worried about extremism in the UK after Hamas\u2019s 7 October attacks on Israel, and that the government \u2013 through Prevent \u2013 \u201cshould pay much more attention to the Hamas support network\u201d. \u201cThere are unfortunately quite a lot of Hamas sympathisers and some operatives in this country,\u201d Shawcross said, adding: \u201cPrevent and the police should have been working much harder against those Hamas people in this country.\u201d He added: \u201cThe public are more at risk because of the events of 7 October and subsequently \u2013 and many, many people in this country are much more frightened than they have ever been before.\u201d Responding to the comments by Shawcross, Sarah St Vincent, executive director of Rights &amp; Security International, said: \u201cSir William\u2019s review of Prevent expressed a desire \u2013 rightly \u2013 for the UK government to take antisemitism seriously. At the same time, it appeared to suggest that Prevent was focusing too heavily on the far right. This is contradictory: antisemitism is the foundation of far-right ideologies. \u201cSir William\u2019s report effectively urged the Home Office to evaluate whether Prevent activities were focusing inadequately on \u2018Islamist\u2019-related concerns, and excessively on far-right issues. The Home Office has now replied that this is not the case, and Sir William appears to be unhappy with this answer.\u201d St Vincent added: \u201cBy now referring vaguely to \u2018those Hamas people in this country\u2019, Sir William risks exacerbating Islamophobia. He also risks pushing the government away from an adequate focus on far-right antisemitism and violence. Violence prevention is not a zero-sum game: police should be directing their energy toward all credible threats and exploring a range of rights-respecting approaches.\u201d Government sources briefed the BBC that the most recent statistics on Prevent referrals end in March 2023, and therefore did not reflect any impact his recommendations might have had on government policy. A Home Office spokesperson said the government had made \u201csignificant progress to deliver a strengthened Prevent\u201d. \u201cWilliam Shawcross\u2019s review was critical to ensuring Prevent is fit for purpose, which is why we accepted his recommendations in full,\u201d the spokesperson continued. \u201cOne year on, we have delivered 30 of the 34 recommendations he made, and we are making rapid progress on delivering the remaining four. \u201cThe government agrees that extreme Islamist ideology presents the greatest threat to the UK and has moved swiftly to update Prevent duty guidance and training to make that clear.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-29T05:00:10Z",
            "content": "Four menhave gone on trial today accused of involvement in the 2018 terrorist attack on Strasbourg\u2019s Christmas market, in which a gunman killed five people and injured 11 others in an assault that was later claimed by Islamic State. Ch\u00e9rif Chekatt, 29, who was born and raised in the city, opened fire with a 19th-century revolver on 11 December in the historic centre. Over the course of 10 minutes, Chekatt attacked passersby with a gun and knife at three different locations in the shadow of the city\u2019s cathedral, where the Christmas market attracts millions of visitors each year. Chekatt, who had a long criminal record with more than 20 convictions for theft and violence, had spent several spells in jail and was on a watchlist of radicalised former prisoners. After the attack, he hailed a taxi to the south of the city. After a 48-hour manhunt, he was killed in a shootout with police. Four French men, aged between 34 and 43, are on trial in Paris. Three \u2013 St\u00e9phane Bodein and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bodein, brothers who buy and sell used cars, and Christian Hoffmann, an unemployed mechanic \u2013 are accused of involvement by helping to procure weapons. Only one of the defendants, Audrey Mondjehi-Kpanhoue, 43, a former security guard who had been a cellmate of Chekatt, is facing terrorism charges and could face life in prison. He is accused of playing a key role in finding a gun and being aware of and sharing Chekatt\u2019s radical convictions. His lawyer said he must not be convicted simply because Chekatt is no longer here to answer for the attacks. A fifth man, aged 84, will not appear for health reasons, and is likely to be tried separately at a later date. The trial will hear accounts of survivors and the families of those killed, including a father who had fled Afghanistan and was visiting the market with his children, as well as a Thai tourist. Dozens of survivors were left with life-changing injuries and psychological trauma. One survivor, now working as a teacher in Paris, said how the attack changed her life forever after two of her friends were shot in front of her. The woman in her 30s, who asked not to be named, described how she had just handed in her PhD thesis and was working as a student journalist on a radio station at the European parliament in Strasbourg. She was being hosted in the city by her colleague, Bartosz Piotr Orent-Niedezelski, known as Bartek, a young French-Polish broadcaster at the European parliament. With them was Antonio Megalizzi, 28, an Italian journalist working on the same European parliament project, as well as another female student journalist. She said: \u201cWe\u2019d been working since the early morning and Bartek said: \u2018Let\u2019s go to the Christmas market. It\u2019s so beautiful, you\u2019ll see\u2019. We took the tram to the city centre, passed the bag checks, where our bags were searched, and toured the market stands looking for presents for our boyfriends and girlfriends back home.\u201d The four took a selfie in front of the Christmas tree in the central square. The woman said they were walking along a narrow street \u201cwhen I stopped to look in the window of a pharmacy decorated with teddy bears, my female friend stopped too\u201d. The two men kept walking and were one metre ahead. She said: \u201cAt that moment I saw the attacker standing with his back to a wall, he lifted his arm, he had a gun and he opened fire. I saw the men fall to the ground.\u201d She said she couldn\u2019t feel her body, which was totally numb, but she ran, and later dragged her female friend who was frozen to the spot. She described the confusion of running into a restaurant to hide. Orent-Niedezelski and Megalizzi died days later in hospital. \u201cThey were kind, always smiling, two of life\u2019s enthusiasts,\u201d she said. \u201cMy world collapsed because of the injustice that set in, the guilt: why did I stop and look in that window?\u201d She said: \u201cHaving seen terrorism with my eyes, I can say it\u2019s hideous. It\u2019s the most violent thing I have ever seen in my life, witnessing two people lose their life in front of me because a young person their own age, who was born and grew up in France, shoots them in the street. How did we get here? I want to speak against hatred and division, against all that separates us, and in support of living together and respecting others.\u201d She said: \u201cAfter the attack, I always felt very alone. I was angry with the people around me for not understanding. I realise now that they can\u2019t fully understand, and that brings a great solitude.\u201d Paul Latouche, a lawyer for several survivors, said: \u201cThe trial is a fundamental step in the grieving process and reconstruction. Strasbourg is a European capital and the stakes of this trial go beyond the borders of France.\u201d On the trial\u2019s opening day, the court established the names of dozens of survivors, wounded and family members of those killed, many of whom will attend court from next week to speak about their grief and psychological trauma. The trial continues until April 4."

            "date": "2024-02-22T14:35:31Z",
            "content": "The bombing started at midnight. According to local residents, Sudanese army aircraft hit an industrial area in El Daein, the capital of East Darfur state, then the city\u2019s main market and at least two other neighbourhoods. In total at least 10 people died in the attack in the early hours of Tuesday morning, including two refugees from South Sudan and six people displaced from elsewhere in Darfur. Dozens were injured, and hundreds of homes reportedly destroyed. Yagoub Siddig, a resident of one of the bombed neighbourhoods, said: \u201cIt was very scary, we lost people \u2026 an entire family died in the east. A lot of houses were destroyed, especially those built with local materials. It feels like they [the army] want us to flee.\u201d This week\u2019s raid was the third by the army since its rival, the Rapid Support Forces, took control of the city in late November. The RSF said civilians had been killed. The army said it had destroyed an RSF weapons depot and that several \u201cfield commanders and Dagalo terrorist mercenaries\u201d were killed, referring to the RSF leader, Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. Internet and mobile networks have gone down in the city, hampering detailed, independent assessments of what happened. The deadly bombing raid was yet more evidence that Sudan\u2019s 10-month conflict, pitting the army against the RSF, shows no sign of abating. Millions of people have been displaced by the fighting, and malnutrition is rife. Earlier this month the UN warned of an \u201cepidemic of suffering\u201d in the country. In recent months, El Daein\u2019s population has swollen with people displaced by fighting from elsewhere in Darfur, a vast region in west Sudan where the RSF is cementing its hold. Some have come from Geneina, the capital of West Darfur state, itself subjected to repeated bombing raids by the army. Attacks from the air on RSF-controlled territory appear to be the army\u2019s only option as it struggles to stem the tide of RSF gains. For those living in affected areas, conversations are dominated about how to get out, and where to go. On a recent visit by the Guardian to the village of Ardamata, situated on the road linking Geneina to its airport, a crowd of people were trying to sell their furniture in order to finance an escape to neighbouring Chad. Recent airstrikes had hit the airport and the village, sowing terror among residents. \u201cSome people I know urinated on their beds when they heard the sound of explosions,\u201d said Rimah Mohamed Abdullah, a 25-year-old university student. \u201cSome nearly went crazy.\u201d Abdullah said that after one raid there was an exodus of people from her neighbourhood towards Adr\u00e9, a town just over the border in Chad. Fighting between the army and the RSF late last year in Geneina and its surrounding villages was brutal. As the RSF attacked, its fighters and allies from other Arab militia targeted men and boys from the Masalit community, an African ethnic group. Many Masalit people fled west to Chad during the worst of the fighting. Although the fighting itself has subsided, a fear of getting bombed by the army, a lack of food, and the threat of looting have put people off returning, according to Jamal Badawi, one of the few traditional Masalit leaders who have stayed in Geneina since the war began. Four of Darfur\u2019s five states are now in the hands of the RSF, which also took control of most of the capital, Khartoum, its sister cities Bahri and Omdurman, and most of the territory in the western Kordofan in the first weeks of the war. Last week the army claimed its first significant advance in 10 months of fighting, regaining control of part of Omdurman. The army said late on Friday that it had succeeded in connecting its two main bases in the city, prompting celebrations among soldiers and local people. The RSF denied the army had advanced. \u201cThe army has turned to propaganda as it is on the verge of defeat,\u201d its media office said in a statement. Not long after the Geneina airport bombing, a family from the Habaniya tribe living in Ardamata decided to leave. They packed two cars stuffed with their belongings but said that as they started the engines they were stopped by RSF fighters. The family said the soldiers told them they were not allowed to go to Chad, though they could go anywhere else in Darfur. It is not clear if the fighters were following an official RSF policy. The RSF commander in West Darfur, Abdulrahman Guma, acknowledged that army bombing raids were an issue for the paramilitary group, which lacks anti-aircraft weapons. Meanwhile, sources close to the military said RSF fighters had seized some anti-aircraft weapons when they captured Geneina\u2019s garrison in November, but that the weapons had been disabled by army soldiers before they withdrew."

            "date": "2024-02-13T15:00:31Z",
            "content": "Three people who displayed images of paragliders at a pro-Palestinian march in central London a week after Hamas militants went on a bloody rampage in Israel have been found guilty of a terror offence. Heba Alhayek, 29, Pauline Ankunda, 26, and Noimutu Olayinka Taiwo, 27, were each given a 12-month conditional discharge. Deputy senior district judge Tan Ikram told them: \u201cYou crossed the line, but it would have been fair to say that emotions ran very high on this issue. Your lesson has been well learned.\u201d The three were not seeking to show support for Hamas, he said. Alhayek and Ankunda attached images of paragliders to their backs with tape, while Taiwo stuck one to the handle of a placard. They displayed the images on 14 October 2023, a week after militants from Hamas used paragliders to enter Israel from Gaza on 7 October. About 1,200 Israelis were killed in the attack and about 240 were abducted and taken to Gaza. The three protesters were charged under the Terrorism Act with carrying or displaying an article to arouse reasonable suspicion that they are supporters of a banned organisation, Hamas, which they denied. After a two-day trial at Westminster magistrates court, the three were found guilty on Tuesday after prosecutors argued it was \u201cno coincidence\u201d the defendants were displaying the images so soon after the attack. Ikram said: \u201cSeven days earlier, Hamas went into Israel with what was described by the media as paragliders. A reasonable person would have seen and read that. \u201cI do not find a reasonable person would interpret the image merely as a symbol of freedom. \u201cI want to be clear, there\u2019s no evidence that any of these defendants are supporters of Hamas, or were seeking to show support for them.\u201d Ikram said he had \u201cdecided not to punish\u201d the defendants as he handed them each a 12-month conditional discharge. Reacting to the verdict, the Crown Prosecution Service said displaying the images amounted to the \u201cglorification of the actions\u201d of Hamas. Lawyers for the three had suggested they were actually displaying images of a parachute emoji rather than paragliders, and claimed police had \u201cmistaken\u201d what they saw that day. Mark Summers KC, for Alhayek and Ankunda, said the idea that the image was a paraglider started with \u201can internet group with an agenda\u201d. He also argued that flying-related images were a common symbol of peace in the region. After the Metropolitan police launched a social media appeal to identify the protesters, Alhayek and Ankunda handed themselves in to Croydon police station, the court heard. In a police interview, the pair initially claimed someone at the demonstration \u201cwho was not known to them\u201d had stuck the images to their backs, before changing their statements, admitting they had attached them themselves, the court was told. When arrested and interviewed under caution, Taiwo said she had been handed the placard and not paid proper attention to the \u201cblurry image\u201d it displayed, the court heard."

            "title": "Dentists barred English NHS patients over skipped checkups in pandemic",
            "date": "2024-02-11T07:00:07Z",
            "content": "Patients across England who failed to visit their dentists since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic have been systematically barred by some clinics from getting NHS treatment. Dental practices across the country informed patients they could no longer get NHS treatment, citing non-attendance over a period of two years or more that included lockdown. The Observer has established that many of these patients were not given any written warning and now face potential future treatment costs of thousands of pounds. The decision to \u201cde-list\u201d some NHS patients comes as the government faces growing anger over the state of dental care in the country, with many patients resorting to \u201cDIY dentistry\u201d out of desperation. Ministers last week launched a recovery plan, with \u00a320,000 bonuses for dentists in areas with the poorest access to NHS care. PM Rishi Sunak has repeatedly cited the \u00a33bn annual budget in England for NHS dentistry, but it has fallen in real terms by more than \u00a3500m in a decade. It also includes dental charges paid by NHS patients worth almost \u00a3747m in 2022/23, according to the latest accounts of the Department of Health and Social Care. This weekend, responding to the Observer\u2019s findings, Healthwatch England, the health and social care champion, said it wanted reforms to allow patients to register with a dental clinic in the same way as a GP surgery. Chris McCann, its director of campaigns, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for people to think that they are \u2018registered\u2019 with a dental practice only to discover that they have been \u2018de-listed\u2019 when they go to make an appointment. \u201cPeople want to sign up with a local NHS dentist in the same way as they register with a GP, knowing they\u2019ll be there for them in the long term.\u201d Under the current system, there is no official NHS dental registration scheme in England and practices can choose whether to provide NHS treatment on an individual basis. Sylvia Suddes, 59, a copy editor from Huddersfield, said she contacted her dental practice in the autumn of 2021, after pandemic lockdown restrictions had been lifted, and was told she could no longer get NHS treatment because of non-attendance. She has not seen a dentist since before lockdown. \u201cNone of my neighbours have got a NHS dentist,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they have a serious problem they call NHS 111.\u201d When Boris Johnson announced a lockdown in March 2020 to prevent the spread of coronavirus, routine dental care was suspended. Dentists were allowed to resume in June, but infection control meant clinics were only able to see a fraction of their usual patients. The British Dental Association (BDA) said in the year from March 2020 about 28m courses of NHS treatment were missed in England. Many people were anxious about appointments and some who have been \u201cde-listed\u201d said they were never contacted after lockdown. Trevor Maggs, 64, a writer, and his partner Gillian, 64, who live near Penzance in Cornwall, were told last week that NHS treatment at their local practice was no longer available because of non-attendance. They had been patients there since 2012. \u201cThey haven\u2019t refused to treat us, but have refused to treat us as NHS patients,\u201d Maggs said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got modest savings and spending thousands of pounds to have our teeth fixed is a bit galling.\u201d Maggs said his last appointment had been in early 2020 before lockdown. He said: \u201cWe are both still very cautious about Covid infections having had it quite badly very early in the first wave and at least once since.\u201d Lizzie Dunthorne, 32, a communications manager who lives in the Cotswolds, called to book a post-Covid dental appointment in August 2021. She was informed she had been could not have NHS care because she had not visited the clinic in Kidlington in Oxfordshire since late 2019. She was not given prior written notification. Dunthorne was unable to find another NHS practice and paid \u00a390 for a private appointment. \u201cThey told me two fillings needed redoing at \u00a3220 each,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t booked to go back.\u201d In Scotland, patients must be given three months\u2019 notice by a dental practice if it intends to remove them from a register. The rules do not apply in England, which allowed practices to \u201cde-list\u201d some NHS patients after the pandemic as they faced a backlog in care and the prospect of better returns from private practice. There is now scant chance in many areas of finding NHS treatment, as seen last week in Bristol, where hundreds of people queued outside the St Pauls Dental Practice in the hope of registering. Shawn Charlwood, chair of the BDA\u2019s general dental practice committee, said hundreds of practices were cross-subsidising their NHS activity with private work. \u201cMany dedicated colleagues are just looking for the exit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cash offered to dentistry doesn\u2019t even begin to reverse a decade of savage cuts.\u201d The BDA does not have figures on patients in England who have been told they are no longer eligible for NHS care at specific clinics, but says practices faced \u201cclear limits on patient throughput\u201d after the pandemic. The BDA says more than 12 million adults in England have unmet need for NHS dentistry, more than one in four of the adult population. An online survey of 500 UK dentists by the BDA last month found more than eight out of 10 had treated patients who had performed \u201cDIY dentistry\u201d. NHS dentistry was founded in 1948, with clinics typically operating independently, providing both NHS and private treatment. Dental charges for NHS patients were first introduced in 1951 and by 2006 covered more than 400 items. The BDA has called for a \u201cdecisive break\u201d from the current dental contract for dentists, which was introduced in 2006 and pays providers an annual sum for delivering an agreed number of courses of treatment. MPs have said the contract is not fit for purpose. The government said last week it was developing further proposals for dental contract reform. The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cOur new dental recovery plan sets out how we will make access to dentistry faster, simpler and fairer. The plan \u2013 backed by \u00a3200m of government funding \u2013 will create an additional 2.5m dental appointments for patients over the next 12 months.\u201d \u201cThe government already invests more than \u00a33 billion each year to support NHS dentistry and we are starting to see progress. Last year, 1.7 million more adults and around 800,000 more children saw an NHS dentist compared to 2022.\u201d A Commons\u2019 health select committee report published in July recommended the government require patients to be registered with an NHS dentist. The government has said it has no plans to introduce official patient registration for dental services, because the current model allows \u201cgreater choice and flexibility for patients\u201d. An NHS England spokesperson said: \u201cThe NHS plan for dentistry will make it easier for patients to get an appointment by supporting dentists to take on new patients and helping practices set up shop in areas where there aren\u2019t enough NHS appointments.\u201d Contributors who provided information for this article responded to a community callout.

            "title": "Italy announces inquiry into its handling of Covid-19 pandemic",
            "date": "2024-02-15T13:11:08Z",
            "content": "Italy will carry out an inquiry into its handling of the coronavirus pandemic in a move hailed as \u201ca great victory\u201d by the relatives of people killed by the virus but criticised by those who were in power at the time. Italy was the first western country to report an outbreak and has the second highest Covid-related death toll to date in Europe, at more than 196,000. Only the UK\u2019s death toll is higher. The creation of a commission to examine \u201cthe government\u2019s actions and the measures adopted by it to prevent and address the Covid-19 epidemiological emergency\u201d was approved by the lower house of parliament after passing in the senate. A Covid-19 inquiry was among the election campaign pledges of the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, whose far-right government came to power in October 2022. Victims\u2019 families had protested against an inquiry proposal by the previous administration, a vast coalition led by Mario Draghi, after attempts were made by the centre-left Democratic party (PD) and the League, which governs the worst-hit Lombardy region, to narrow its scope by focusing only on the outbreak in China and introducing a cutoff date of 31 January 2020, therefore not examining the scramble by the Italian government to contain rapidly rising infections and deaths in the weeks that followed. Consuelo Locati, a lawyer representing hundreds of families who brought legal proceedings against former leaders, said: \u201cThe families were the first to ask for a commission and so for us this is a great victory. The commission is important because it has the task, at least on paper, to analyse what went wrong and the errors committed so as not to repeat the massacre we all suffered.\u201d The commission will investigate the actions of individuals including Giuseppe Conte, the former prime minister, Roberto Speranza, the former health minister, and Attilio Fontana, the president of Lombardy. Conte, who now leads the Five Star Movement, which at the time was in government with the PD, accused Meloni\u2019s government of \u201ccowardice\u201d and of creating \u201can abnormal tool\u201d to politically attack its predecessors. \u201cBut you will not govern for life and this could prove to be a dangerous precedent,\u201d he said, adding that he had \u201cnothing to hide\u201d. Speranza claimed the objective of the commission was not to make the healthcare system more resilient but to vilify the former government. In June last year, prosecutors in Bergamo, the Lombardy province heavily hit by Covid-19 at the start of the pandemic, shelved an investigation into Conte and Speranza\u2019s management of the emergency after they found no evidence connecting the deaths to their failure to swiftly adopt measures to contain the escalating virus. Italy\u2019s first coronavirus case was confirmed in Codogno in southern Lombardy on 21 February 2020. Two days later, an outbreak occurred at the hospital in Alzano Lombardo, a town in Bergamo. However, unlike Codogno, where quarantine measures were implemented immediately along with nine other towns in Lombardy and one in Veneto, Bergamo went into lockdown with the entire Lombardy region two weeks later. A case brought by relatives of the deceased at Rome\u2019s civil court is ongoing. The court is examining the same evidence that Bergamo prosecutors did, including the alleged absence of an updated national pandemic plan. \u201cThe difference with the Rome case is that there will definitely be a sentence, which will either go in our favour or not,\u201d said Locati, whose father was among those to die early in the pandemic."

            "title": "Fourteen Days co-edited by Margaret Atwood review \u2013 a pandemic tale",
            "date": "2024-02-21T09:00:11Z",
            "content": "\u2018In the dark times / Will there also be singing?\u201d muses Brecht in the Svendborg Poems. \u201cYes, there will also be singing / About the dark times.\u201d The impulse for lamentation in a crisis is instinctive and, perhaps, socially useful. But how we voice a response to catastrophe can be contentious, not least with the recent Covid pandemic. And while it may be too early to judge the overall effect of the crisis on the written word, we seem to have come out of it with more of a feeling of discord than harmony, and a sense that the plague and its quarantine accelerated an already existing divisiveness and cultural dissonance. So in many ways the publication of Fourteen Days could not have been more timely. Commissioned by the US Authors Guild Foundation, with proceeds going to support its charitable work, this is a collaborative novel set in New York at the start of lockdown, offering a collective narrative of that time and produced by 36 literary heavyweights from the US and Canada. Edited by Margaret Atwood and Douglas Preston, there\u2019s work here from an impressive list of writers, including Emma Donoghue, Ishmael Reed, Dave Eggers and Celeste Ng. The book is pitched as an \u201code to the power of storytelling and human connection\u201d, and the setting is an apartment building in Manhattan, where residents gather on the rooftop at twilight; socially distanced interactions develop as they begin telling tales. A shared sense of grief and isolation emerges and, as New York becomes the epicentre of the pandemic, the stories become \u201ca reminder of what we\u2019re losing, keeping people away from their loved ones as they die\u201d. An introduction explains that each character has been created by a different writer, and a wide-ranging cast reflects the diversity of the authors. The rooftop becomes a very crowded stage and each day a wonderful variety of testimonies is recounted. There are ghost stories, angels appearing in Mexico, a nun in a Catholic hospital who can predict when patients are about to die, war stories, a tale of gay adoption, an account of how Shakespeare survived the plague that devastated London in the 1590s. Even an anecdote about a pet rabbit becomes a parable about how shared trauma can act as a bond. The standout story for me is set in Texas in the 1970s, about a Black female country and western musician who falls in love with a white male star, \u201ckind of a cross between Kristofferson and Glen Campbell with a lot more grit\u201d. Harsh realities of time and place are captured with a real musicality, in a sad and beautiful ballad of doomed love. It\u2019s revealed at the back of the book to have been written by Alice Randall. The central narrator of the novel is the building\u2019s caretaker, Yessie, a second-generation Romanian-American lesbian whose prime motivation is to reach her father, who has Alzheimer\u2019s and is trapped in a nursing home in another part of the city. In the meantime she struggles to keep a thread running through the novel, diligently recording each evening gathering for us, referring to convenient notes left by the former caretaker that give useful character breakdowns and catchy nicknames for the residents. There\u2019s an awful lot of setup here, which hinders the sense of a coherent novel. Instead, a rather contrived frame story to the individual narratives is established, like Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron, itself set during the Black Death pandemic of 14th-century Europe. It\u2019s an obvious inspiration, though it doesn\u2019t get a mention until the 12th day. \u201cListening to all of you up here, hiding from the plague, telling stories,\u201d declares the Poet, a struggling Black writer and academic. \u201cHow could this whole thing not remind us of the Decameron?\u201d His own tale becomes something of a recursive satire, recounting a seminar in which diverse arts practitioners hold \u201cclassical readings about the plague now that it has been declared a national emergency\u201d. Representatives of various minorities at the seminar soon condemn Boccaccio as being homophobic, transphobic, ableist, elitist, antisemitic and racist. Here, as elsewhere, there is much debate about who is truly given a voice, where \u201cone person\u2019s censorship is another person\u2019s didacticism\u201d. And despite, or maybe because of, the discursive nature of the novel, a strong theme does emerge from the heart of it: the struggle for identity. The appearance of ghosts also becomes a recurring trope, providing a rather hokey denouement, but it\u2019s the spectre of the culture wars that truly haunts the book. Fourteen Days chronicles how Covid-19 exacerbated a fever of competing rights and fierce arguments over free speech and silencing. And it inadvertently pinpoints the effect that lockdown had on literature: how it has become increasingly solipsistic and autofictional, with lived experience valued over creative storytelling. The power of much of the writing here is undeniable, as is the sense of personal testimony. The fact that it doesn\u2019t cohere as a novel is perhaps the point, giving us a more accurate reflection of the fractured world we came back to. The imagination remained socially distanced, leaving us with a strange sense of collective isolation. \u2022 Fourteen Days: A Collaborative Novel, edited by Margaret Atwood and Douglas Preston, is published by Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a320.

            "title": "Killer fungi detectives: inside the lab that may be fighting the next pandemic ",
            "date": "2024-02-28T14:00:19Z",
            "content": "The first tray of yellow-lidded specimen jars holds chunks of flesh \u2013 lung, perhaps, or muscle \u2013 some cerebrospinal fluid and another liquid, possibly from a brain abscess. The second holds a rainbow of colourful fungi, cultivated from those specimens. One growth is green and fluffy, like something you would find in a sharehouse fridge \u2013 penicillium, maybe. Another is a dark grey or brown, like animal fur. There are bright white fuzzballs and blackish blobs. One growth leaches red into the medium it sits in. Fungal pathogens come from all over Australia to this Adelaide laboratory, the National Mycological Reference Centre, for identification. Mycologists are on the lookout for new pathogens, which are starting to spread more because of climate change, and which can be deadly in the absence of effective antifungal drugs. They work under biohazard signs, sorting specimens and growing colonies on petri dishes, to slice off and put under the microscope. There\u2019s a weird, wonderful library of mycology books, a DNA sequencer and a reference collection with boxes and boxes full of vials, from azole-resistant Aspergillus to Zygomycetes. Dr Sarah Kidd is the centre\u2019s head. She was interested in Cryptococcus gattii, which live in eucalyptus trees and infect koalas, before she moved to Canada in 2006. And, serendipitously, there was a C gatti outbreak in Vancouver while she was there. It was a mystery how that fungus associated with Australia cropped up over there, but the theories are that it was something to do with changing global temperatures, perhaps some mutations. Asked if those mutations scare her, Kidd says it\u2019s \u201ccertainly not a good thing \u2026 but it keeps things interesting\u201d. The fascination with fungal pathogens has recently been piqued by the HBO series The Last of Us, which stars Pedro Pascal, Bella Ramsey and a host of humans turned into zombies by a parasitic fungal infection. \u201cThe fungus in The Last of Us, Cordyceps, it certainly does cause infection and sort of zombifies, if you will, insects,\u201d Kidd says. \u201cBut insects have a much cooler body temperature than humans \u2026 The vast majority of fungi cannot grow at 37C. So it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll see a human brain fungus zombification. \u201cShows like The Last of Us have been really fantastic for drawing attention to mycology \u2026 Before that, I think people considered mycology to be about mushrooms, and foraging \u2026 or they knew that fungi can cause infections on skin, on toenails. \u201cBut I think very few people, even now, really appreciate that fungi cause life-threatening infections.\u201d There are hundreds of fungi that can affect humans. Almost 4m global deaths a year are associated with fungal infections, according to research published earlier this year in the Lancet \u2013 and it\u2019s likely that this figure is massively underreported. A pathogen of much more concern than Cordyceps at the moment is Candida auris. It affects immunocompromised patients, people in intensive care and people with cancer or HIV/Aids. Kidd says it can live on people, happily coexisting, until it finds its way into the bloodstream. It is resistant to many of the existing therapies and can spread easily from person to person \u2013 not unlike superbugs, bacterial infections that have grown resistant to antibiotics. \u201cThey\u2019re calling this the first fungal superbug,\u201d Kidd says, \u201cbecause it behaves like any of those resistant bacteria.\u201d Another pathogen starting to crop up in Australia is Trichophyton indotineae. It\u2019s a superficial rash, but it never goes away. People try to self-treat it with ointments, but they don\u2019t work and its resistance grows. \u201cYou can have whole families affected by these essentially incurable rashes,\u201d Kidd says. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see those come into Australia as well.\u201d Kidd returned to Australia from Canada to take over at the centre from emeritus mycologist David Ellis, a legend in the field. Ellis is quick to point to Kidd\u2019s impressive achievements, including a paper on fungal name changes that was listed in the Infectious Diseases Society of America\u2019s top 10 papers for the year, and the book Descriptions of Medical Fungi, on which she was the first author. A lack of treatments In 2022 the World Health Organization identified four fungal pathogens as \u201ccritical\u201d among 19 fungi that pose the biggest threat to public health: Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida auris, Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans. The WHO emphasised the danger of having only a few antifungal medicines, the expansion of fungal diseases due to global warming and international travel and trade, and their increasing resistance to treatment. Dr Megan Lenardon, a microbiologist at the University of New South Wales, warned just a few weeks ago that fungi had historically been overlooked in infectious disease research. She has been studying the Candida species, which cause thrush infections in tens of millions of people each year. While thrush itself \u2013 an overgrowth of Candida often in the mouth or genital area \u2013 is generally not dangerous, Candida can become invasive and spread through the organs and bloodstream. \u201cWe call them \u2018opportunistic invasive\u2019 fungal pathogens because they don\u2019t kill healthy people,\u201d Lenardon says. \u201cBut if they find themselves in a host who is susceptible, then they can kill.\u201d Lenardon warns that fungi may evolve to resist higher temperatures, meaning they can survive in human bodies but says the likelihood of a pandemic is \u201cprobably still relatively low\u201d. Still, she says, there are no vaccines imminent and few preventive treatments in the pipeline. At the centre in Adelaide they can screen for infections and implement extra precautions with infected patients. They are working on specialised tests and treatments, and hope they will have enough to tackle what comes. Kidd says we \u201cdon\u2019t have a huge problem\u201d with Candida auris in Australia \u2013 \u201cyet\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 February 2024.

            "title": "Melbourne airport faces busiest day since pre-pandemic ahead of Taylor Swift concerts",
            "date": "2024-02-16T02:32:45Z",
            "content": "Melbourne airport is facing its busiest day since before the pandemic and one-way domestic prices are surging in excess of $1,500 as Swiftie mania descends on the capital city. The pop superstar Taylor Swift has already touched down for the Australian leg of the sold-out Eras Tour, but the journey is just beginning for thousands of interstate fans making the trek to Melbourne ahead of her Friday night concert. A spokesperson for Melbourne airport said 117,000 passengers were expected to move through terminals on Friday \u2013 a post-Covid record. There were 775 take-offs and landings scheduled, also a record number. \u201cAirlines such as Qantas and Virgin Australia have added extra flights from key domestic destinations, and there are also extra flights operating from New Zealand to allow people to get to the concerts this weekend,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cFebruary is typically the quietest month for travel, so to be breaking records today is extraordinary.\u201d Social media users have reported an \u201celectric\u201d atmosphere on domestic flights to Melbourne, with a video of flight attendants dancing to Shake it Off going viral and an entire flight from Perth bursting in to an impromptu rendition of Cruel Summer. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Qantas added 60 additional flights in June last year to gear up for concert demand, including 24 additional flights between Sydney and Melbourne. In early February, a further four return flights were added between Melbourne and Auckland, Brisbane and Perth. The airline carrier is gearing up to carry 35% more passengers into Melbourne from its domestic and trans-Tasman network over the concert period compared with the same time last year. It came amid a 350% surge in bookings between New Zealand and Melbourne at the time of presale compared to the same time last year. For Swifties lucky enough to secure a last-minute ticket to Friday\u2019s concert, the next battle will be facing last-minute one-way flight costs \u2013 in excess of $1,000 \u2013 to make it to Melbourne in time. There were just a handful of options left from Sydney to Melbourne on Jetstar\u2019s website as of Friday morning, with prices ranging from $317 to $1,048 one way. Virgin was similarly pinched, with just half a dozen flights available that would get superfans to the MCG from Sydney by 6.30pm \u2013 costing from $551 to $859 economy one way. Qantas had half hourly flights available for the popular route from midday and flights every 10 to 15 minutes through from five to 7pm \u2013 but it would cost you. The cheapest option was $648 for economy, surging up to $1,630 for a business seat one way. The Melbourne airport spokesperson said due to the surging number of arriving passengers, staff had been working with ground transport operators to keep up with demand. Skybus had put on an extra six buses on Friday to assist with transfers to the city, while additional customer service staff were stationed around terminals to help arriving passengers. It comes amid controversy over Swift\u2019s heavy emitter status due to her penchant for private jet travel. More than 6,000 enthusiastic fans watched flight VJT993 carry Swift from Honolulu to Melbourne on Thursday evening \u2013 becoming the globe\u2019s most tracked aeroplane. Swift claims to have bought double the amount of carbon credits required to offset her travel for the Eras Tour. But according to Carbon Market Watch, she comes first in the list of celebrities with the highest Co2 emissions from flying, with her private jet usage amounting to an estimated 8,300 tonnes of carbon emissions in 2022. The figure is 1,800 times the average person\u2019s annual emissions."
