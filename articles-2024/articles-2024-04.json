            "date": "2024-04-25T05:00:17Z",
            "content": "The destruction of nature over the rest of the decade could trigger a bigger economic slump in Britain than those caused by the 2008 global financial crisis and the Covid pandemic, experts have warned. Sounding the alarm over the rising financial cost from pollution, damage to water systems, soil erosion, and threats from disease, the report by the Green Finance Institute warned that further breakdown in the UK\u2019s natural environment could lead to a 12% loss of gross domestic product (GDP) by the 2030s. In a report that received input from experts across academia and government, the authors argued that \u201cgradual, year-to year environmental degradation is as detrimental or more so than climate change\u201d. The continued loss of natural habitats in urban and rural areas would compare unfavourably with the financial crisis of 2008, which took about 5% off the value of UK GDP, while the Covid pandemic cost the UK 11% of its GDP in 2020. The academics used three scenarios to construct the report: domestic risks from continued UK environment breakdown; international risks \u2013 including destruction to nature in countries which are key UK trading partners; and a health scenario, focusing on the dangers of a fresh global pandemic. All three took into account current trends in environmental breakdown \u2013 including water and air pollution, soil health erosion and biodiversity loss \u2013 resulting in a hit to GDP worth up to 3%, or about \u00a370bn by the late 2020s. The report then added \u201cacute risks\u201d on top of these trends \u2013 including floods, droughts and wildfires \u2013 which would result in a 6% loss to GDP in the domestic and international scenarios, and a 12% hit in a health scenario, reflecting the extreme dangers to the UK economy from a renewed pandemic. Ministers are expected to take an interest in the report amid concern over the potential dangers to the economy from nature breakdown. Environment minister Richard Benyon said the report showed that nature \u201cunderpins the health of our economy and it is under threat from a global nature crisis\u201d. The former Conservative MP, whose family controls a 5,600-hectare (14,000-acre) estate in west Berkshire, southern England, said the responsibility to conserve nature \u201clies with all sectors and sections of society, and green finance has a crucial role to play\u201d. He said: \u201cThe findings in this report will help people and institutions across the corporate and finance sectors understand that it is in their own interests to go further and faster for the planet to protect it for future generations.\u201d Shadow environment secretary, Steve Reed, blamed the government for the UK becoming \u201cone of the most nature-depleted countries in the world\u201d. Saying that the UK needed \u201cto reverse the tide of destruction\u201d, Reed committed Labour to cleaner air and water \u201cand growing nature-rich habitats for wildlife to thrive\u201d. The Green Finance Institute describes itself as the UK and Europe\u2019s \u201cprincipal forum for innovation in green finance\u201d bringing together banks, academics, philanthropists and government bodies to develop climate-friendly policies and financial products. The report warned that unless action is taken, UK banks will need to reduce their exposure to the worst hit industries or find themselves increasing the risk of losses from bad loans. About 50% of the extra cost will come from the loss of nature overseas that the UK relies on to provide food, natural resources and trade. Partly funded by the government with input from the Treasury and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the authors also relied on advice and information from the Bank of England, Oxford and Reading universities, the UN\u2019s environment programme, and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The report said: \u201cThe impacts of biodiversity loss and environmental degradation will not be felt alone but will compound with climate risks. Both are happening at once and there are strong feedback effects between the loss of natural capital and climate change.\u201d The study follows a Treasury-backed review in 2021 by the Cambridge economist Sir Partha Dasgupta, who found that the world was being put at \u201cextreme risk\u201d by the failure of economics to take account of the rapid depletion of the natural world. Last year, the government agency Natural England launched its Nature Returns programme to coordinate efforts across government and the private sector to explore how the UK can best use land in England \u201cto address climate change whilst producing food and promoting thriving nature\u201d. The agency said it wanted \u201cto mobilise the billions in private investment that government estimates we need to meet our national net zero commitments\u201d."

            "date": "2024-04-29T05:00:25Z",
            "content": "By the time of the European parliament elections in June, this year\u2019s rightward drift in European politics will have turned into a tidal wave. Ultra-nationalist demagogues and populist-nationalists are now leading the polls in Italy, the Netherlands, France, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia, and running second in Germany and Sweden. There are two hard-right groupings in the European parliament \u2013 Identity and Democracy and European Conservatives and Reformists. Between them, they could secure as much as 25% of the June vote. But even more ominously, in almost every part of Europe including Britain, these factions are forcing the hand of the traditional centre-right parties \u2013 which, one by one, are capitulating to ever more extreme anti-immigration, anti-trade and anti-environment positions. The rightward shift is, of course, a western and not just European phenomenon, with Trump 2.0 advocating a far more aggressive protectionist and nationalist agenda than Trump 1.0. But Europe stands out from the US in one important respect. While the US economy roars forward \u2013 even if the average American voter does not feel the full benefits \u2013 Europe, and especially its industrial engine-room, Germany, continues to suffer from near-zero growth and stagnation in terms of living standards. And having lived through a decade of consistently low growth, the continent is now divided between an optimistic but declining minority, who still hold to the expectation that a rising tide lifts all boats, and the growing and more pessimistic majority who now see life as a zero-sum game. The latter is a mindset that, recognising the economic pie is not growing, leads people to an erroneous conclusion: \u201cI will only do well if someone else does badly.\u201d Once embraced, this adversarial view is hard to shake. The supporting evidence is clear: in the largest western European countries, many people are pessimistic about their prospects, believing that their generation will do worse than their parents. Only 26% of French people and just 33% of Italians think they will do better in future, according to a seven-nation poll by Focaldata. In the Netherlands and Germany, as many are pessimistic as optimistic. While Ireland and Sweden top the league for optimism, only 46% and 40% respectively feel they will fare better, with 39% and 35% taking the opposite view. In no country are a majority of people optimistic about their future. The pollsters also tested the classic zero-sum proposition that you can only get rich at the expense of others. In every major European country, the results are dramatic: 59% of British respondents believe they can only enhance their personal wealth if others do badly, and just 17% disregarded this notion. Similarly, in Germany and the Netherlands, 60% and 58% respectively hold this view, compared with only 16% and 15% who rejected it. In almost all countries, more than 50% displayed a zero-sum mentality. There are good reasons why these trends are becoming entrenched. A low-growth economy creates a doom loop as pessimism begets a blame culture \u2013 and the more we blame others, the more pessimistic we become. Once people convince themselves that the state of their economy is so weak that they can only improve their lot at someone else\u2019s expense, they vote for parties that specialise in targeting those they think are holding them back \u2013 immigrants, foreigners and minorities. These parties offer nothing in terms of economic policies to generate long-term growth. The result is that zero-sum politics exacerbates the downward economic trends, and this, in turn, intensifies and widens the appeal of zero-sum thinking. The problem Europe now faces is that the very measures it must adopt to escape this doom loop \u2013 new investment in technology, clean energy and medical advances \u2013 are being rendered impossible by its policy of fiscal retrenchment. The European growth and stability pact rules out member states having deficits above 3%, and perhaps as importantly, makes no distinction between public spending on consumption and spending on investment. Added to that, Germany has a debt brake enshrined in its constitution which limits the government\u2019s structural deficit to 0.35% of GDP. This casts a shadow over the whole of Europe, with the German people facing severe cuts in public spending \u2013 cuts that will torpedo any chance of repairing the country\u2019s beleaguered infrastructure and frustrating its transition from heavy engineering to IT and AI-based industries. While China can subsidise to the point of undercutting Europe on electric cars, batteries and other new technologies, and Bidenomics is running huge deficits that are stimulating the economy, Europe is stuck in a fiscal bind. The European recovery and resilience facility ends for good in 2026, with no replacement. The stability and growth pact, which has restrictive conditions that were suspended during the Covid crisis, resumes its tough regime next year. France and 11 other European countries are already in trouble, unable to invest more because they are already running allegedly unsustainable deficits. So, at the very time that investment needs to increase, it is likely to fall. And the European election results are unlikely to make things any better. Essential green investment will fall down the agenda as anti-environmentalist parties gain an upper hand. Protectionism will become the order of the day with trade wars, which hit Europe harder than anywhere else. Unless something gives, a low-growth Europe will remain stuck in its rut \u2013 and the populist xenophobes will triumph. The nationalist timebomb is ticking. Across the continent, Europeans need a plan for better jobs through economic and environmental transformation. When the Polish trade union Solidarity was first formed, its anti-Soviet slogan was \u201cNo solidarity without freedom\u201d. But soon many realised that free-for-all neoliberal economics would mean rising inequality and low living standards for the mass of people, and so a new slogan soon rang out: \u201cThere is no solidarity in freedom.\u201d If progressives want to prevent an election campaign dominated by anti-immigrant propaganda, they will have to stand up to protectionism and xenophobia by showing the benefits of cooperation. Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010"

            "title": "Ratings agency downgrades China debt outlook over economic uncertainty",
            "date": "2024-04-10T08:04:53Z",
            "content": "Fitch has downgraded the outlook on China\u2019s debt as it warned of increased risks to the economy while the country moves away from its reliance on growth from the property sector. On Wednesday the US-based agency said it had revised China\u2019s sovereign credit rating from stable to negative, saying this reflected the \u201cincreasing risks to China\u2019s public finance outlook\u201d as the country \u201ccontends with more uncertain economic prospects\u201d. The downgrade comes amid a prolonged crisis in the country\u2019s property sector that has been running since 2021, when a regulatory crackdown on debt-fuelled construction triggered a liquidity squeeze. The huge Chinese property company Evergrande was ordered to go into liquidation earlier this year, while last week the rival crisis-hit developer Country Garden suspended trade in its shares in Hong Kong after delaying the publication of its annual financial results. Beijing has responded with moves to address the issues and recently announced a series of targeted measures to move growth to other parts of the economy. This has included steps to help other sectors, including the issuance of billions of dollars in sovereign bonds, aimed at boosting infrastructure spending and spurring consumption. Fitch said that the country\u2019s economic prospects were uncertain because of this transition away from \u201cproperty-reliant growth\u201d, to what the government views as a more \u201csustainable growth model\u201d. It said: \u201cWide fiscal deficits and rising government debt in recent years have eroded fiscal buffers from a ratings perspective.\u201d The agency added that while the Chinese government\u2019s fiscal policy was likely to play an important role in driving growth in the coming years, it could also keep debt on a \u201csteady upward trend\u201d. Fitch forecasts that the general government deficit will rise to 7.1% of gross domestic product in 2024, from 5.8% in 2023. While it lowered its outlook from \u201cstable\u201d, indicating a downgrade is possible over the medium term, the agency affirmed China\u2019s issuer default rating at A+. The Chinese government said the decision was \u201cregrettable\u201d and said the ratings methodology had \u201cfailed to effectively reflect the positive effects of China\u2019s fiscal policies on boosting economic growth\u201d. Beijing last month set a goal of 5% growth for the world\u2019s second biggest economy in 2024. Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING, said China needed to strike a careful balancing act. \u201cFiscal support in our view is important in order to avoid falling \u2026 into a negative feedback loop of weak confidence, falling asset prices, and slower economic growth. This will cause government debt levels to rise in the near term,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, long-term fiscal consolidation efforts remain important. In China\u2019s case, finding a viable alternative for land sales is an important step to take in the medium term, but the obvious solutions to this \u2013 like increasing other taxes \u2013 are unpalatable.\u201d Dan Wang, the chief economist of Hang Seng Bank China, said Fitch\u2019s move reflected \u201cfundamental concern\u201d over China\u2019s fiscal health and its ability to drive long-term growth. Gary Ng, an Asia-Pacific senior economist at Natixis, stressed that the downgrade did not mean China would default any time soon, adding: \u201cFitch\u2019s outlook revision reflects the more challenging situation in China\u2019s public finance regarding the double whammy of decelerating growth and more debt.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-28T06:00:04Z",
            "content": "Now, let me get this straight. We have a fissiparous, Brexit-supporting government, many of whose MPs are stepping down, convinced that their party is heading for its wilderness years. Correspondingly, we have a Labour opposition that is riding high in the polls, led by Keir Starmer, who \u2013 unlike his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 played a noble part in the remain campaign and argued passionately for a second referendum. Proponents of a second referendum hoped that the country would acknowledge its historic mistake, and return to the European Union it should never have left. I was one of them. We failed. Since that failure, what we were worried would manifest itself has indeed manifested itself. Brexit is an economic disaster, with the Office for Budget Responsibility and National Institute of Social and Economic Research estimating the hit to the nation\u2019s GDP at anything between 4% and 6%. There are daily reports now of the bureaucratic disruption at customs to what was once the ordinary course of business for small and medium-sized firms. Exports and imports alike are affected. There are mounting supply chain shortages; costs are rising as a direct result of Brexit, with more disruption to come. Farmers who voted for Brexit now regret not having been more careful about what they wished for. As for those famous trade deals, promised as substitutes for deals with our nearest and largest market, they have been replaced by \u2013 er, well, let\u2019s face it, they have not been replaced. It\u2019s pathetic: a national example of self-harm that makes us an international laughing stock. But the disaster is not just about business, trade and the economy. It embraces people\u2019s rights, privileges and opportunities \u2013 made possible, indeed taken for granted, via our membership of the EU. This is especially bad for the young, not least for the 60% of 18- to 24-year-olds who, surveys indicate, think leaving the EU was a mistake. Defeatists tend to say that the EU would not want us back. Certainly they would want to deal with trustworthy people, which Boris Johnson and co were not. But they too are troubled by the consequences of Brexit \u2013 although, as I have said before, they know that what has happened to Britain has acted as a brake on potential leavers in the remaining EU nations. But what happens when the EU offers an olive branch \u2013 a plan for 18- to 30-year-olds in all member countries and the UK to be able to work and study throughout the EU for up to four years? Rishi Sunak rejects it immediately, and Labour follows suit with all that guff about \u201cred lines\u201d. Now, wait for it, the reductio ad absurdum of Labour\u2019s position is this: we are told that it will fight the coming election on the Conservatives\u2019 \u201ceconomic failure\u201d, not on Brexit. This is, I think, a classic example of what my philosopher friends term a \u201ccategory mistake\u201d. Brexit constitutes an integral part of this government\u2019s economic failure. Highlighting that failure, and promising to reverse it, should be central to Labour\u2019s strategy. The fact of the matter is that Starmer was right about Brexit, and the Brexiters who captured the Tory party were wrong. I gather that there are rejoin candidates in the imminent local elections. It might strengthen Starmer\u2019s arm if they do well. It is a commonplace that the British economy is suffering from years of underinvestment, and that this has undoubtedly affected its productivity. There are too many international comparisons from which the UK emerges poorly. In part, the situation resembles the way that successive Conservative and Labour governments in the 1950s and 1960s were concerned about what was known as \u201crelative decline\u201d and decided that one way of dealing with this was to join what was then the Common Market. Association agreements were not enough. We needed the full works. After several failed attempts, we entered the European Economic Community in 1973, and that evolved into the EU, with the added benefit of the formation of the internal \u2013 single \u2013 market, in whose formation we played a crucial role. That gave a vital boost to our economic performance. Now, at a time when there are so many repair jobs to be addressed, but endless complaints about the cost, UK plc needs another boost, and what Keynes called the \u201canimal spirits\u201d of entrepreneurs require a shot in the arm. In my view, a more confident Starmer could provide that if he ceased being mesmerised by \u201cred wall\u201d Brexiters and returned to first principles. Most people now regard Brexit as a serious mistake. Re-entry would be good for investment \u2013 and for growth and tax revenue. As the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney puts it: \u201c\u2018Take back control\u2019 was actually code for \u2018tear down your future.\u2019\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-06T11:00:33Z",
            "content": "As fast-food workers celebrated a pivotal wage increase to $20 an hour in California last week, an old economic debate was awakened by business groups and others claiming the increase will wind up hurting workers through reduced hours and layoffs, hurt customers with price hikes, and harm the franchise owners of fast-food restaurants. Their critics are not so sure. The hard-fought wage increase to $20 an hour from California\u2019s current minimum wage, $16 an hour, was a compromise to initial demands of $22 an hour with annual wage increases. Representatives of fast-food workers and the fast-food industry came to a deal to avoid what would have been a costly ballot initiative over the passage and signing of the California fast-food sector bill last year. \u201cFrontline workers like me organized, went on strike, and fought to pass a historic law that raises our wages and gives us a seat at table with some of the biggest fast-food corporations in the world,\u201d said Anjelica Hernandez, a McDonald\u2019s worker in Los Angeles for nearly 20 years. \u201cEven though we are the engine of a billion-dollar industry, too many of us struggle to keep up with rent, our bills and the rising cost of living.\u201d The minimum wage for fast-food workers at larger chains was agreed last September and increased to $20 an hour on 1 April, but numerous reports have already been made that the wage hike is resulting in job losses and price increases for customers. The decision by two Pizza Hut franchises in California to lay off more than 1,000 delivery driver employees and rely on gig delivery drivers instead has been cited in claims that the minimum wage rise will result in layoffs and job losses. \u201cThe reality is that delivery drivers have become more numerous in the last couple years because of Covid,\u201d said Michael Reich, UC Berkeley chair of the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics. \u201cThe pizza companies have been moving to make their delivery drivers not employees but instead rely on these delivery services for quite some time. And I think Pizza Hut is going to make this change anyway.\u201d Reich also argued that previous research had found employment increases as a result of higher minimum wage, lowers turnover rates for businesses, and makes it easier to recruit and retain employees. The research is unlikely to deter attacks. A group representing fast-food franchise owners poured more than half a million dollars into political donations for ads opposing elected officials who helped craft and pass the legislation. A Wall Street Journal op-ed referred to the California wage increase as \u201ccrazy\u201d for paying \u201cburger flippers\u201d $20 an hour. The New York Post claimed Los Angeles fast-food chains increased prices on 1 April in response to the law, including citing price increases at the actor Kevin Hart\u2019s chain Hart House, which doesn\u2019t have enough locations to be subjected to the new law, which stipulates the chains must have at least 60 restaurants nationwide. A McDonald\u2019s franchise owner of 21 locations complained to a local Los Angeles news outlet that they could not \u201craise prices enough\u201d. McDonald\u2019s and Chipotle blamed the wage increase for anticipated price hikes in California ahead of the wage increase taking effect. El Pollo Loco claimed it would be looking into automation to cut labor costs due to the law. The Center for Union Facts, a non-profit founded by a Washington lobbyist, Rick Berman, who 60 Minutes referred to as \u201cDr Evil\u201d for his tactics in advocating for business interests, is running television advertisements in California claiming the wage increase is a \u201cwrecking ball\u201d for the fast-food industry. But researchers have long criticized these claims of causation which have frequently been made in response to minimum wage increases around the US, all of which have come at the state level because Washington has failed to act on raising the federal minimum wage from the $7.25 an hour minimum last passed in 2009. \u201cOverall, study after study shows that increases to the minimum wage actually have a net gain. They produce a stimulus effect. If you give poor people more money, they\u2019re going to spend it locally, including on rent, utilities and housing. It doesn\u2019t get much more local than that, and that increased spending actually produces jobs,\u201d said Tia Koonse, legal and policy research manager at the UCLA Labor Center. An analysis of financial data over the past decade by researchers at the Roosevelt Institute found the fast-food industry has more than enough profits to raise wages without affecting prices and employment and have been hiking prices far beyond their operating costs for years. \u201cIn 2023 alone, the 10 largest publicly traded fast-food companies spent $6.1bn on share repurchases,\u201d noted the report. \u201cAs with most industries, the fast-food industry has historically charged higher prices than their marginal costs. However, between 2014 and 2023, markups increased at an annual rate of 2.2%, faster than at any period since 1978.\u201d Ali Bustamante, author of the report and deputy director of worker power and economic security at the Roosevelt Institute, added: \u201cThere\u2019s really an opportunity here to revert profits back into workers back into the source of productivity for these businesses in a way that is going to be beneficial, not just for the overall economy, but certainly for these businesses in the long term.\u201d"

            "title": "Is Shell trying to kill the London stock market?",
            "date": "2024-04-11T04:00:22Z",
            "content": "Last July, Wael Sawan, the chief executive of Shell, told the BBC about the terrific time he had on a visit to the New York stock exchange. The welcome was \u201cexemplary\u201d, he enthused, and the locals even flew the Shell flag next to their own. \u201cThey [the NYSE officials] said we continue to value a company that provides us the energy we desperately need,\u201d he continued, adding that he wouldn\u2019t rule out moving Shell\u2019s stock market listing to the US in time, an inflammatory suggestion given the general angst over the state of the London market. Now he\u2019s at it again. In remarks to Bloomberg published this week, he said Shell had \u201ca location\u201d \u2013 meaning London \u2013 \u201cthat clearly seems to be undervalued\u201d. His beef is the perceived undervaluation of Shell\u2019s shares versus those of New York-listed rivals Chevron and ExxonMobil. If the valuation gap doesn\u2019t close, \u201cwe have to look at all options. All options,\u201d he emphasised. For good measure, his predecessor as chief executive, Ben van Beurden, joined the grumbling, telling an FT conference this week that Shell is \u201cmassively undervalued\u201d in London and that deeper pools of capital in the US, higher valuations and the \u201cmore positive\u201d attitudes of investors \u201cconspire\u201d against all European energy companies. \u201cSomething will have to give,\u201d opined Van Beurden. This is starting to sound like a campaign to create an air of inevitability around a switch to the US. Or, if it isn\u2019t that, Shell\u2019s top operatives seem transfixed by the notion that a relisting will cure all their troubles. It\u2019s their job to fret about the share price, but it\u2019s hard to overstate how detrimental this is for the London Stock Exchange. The biggest company on the market is openly threatening to leave. That is a different order of seriousness than seeing Flutter, Ferguson and CRH flee to the US. If Shell goes, who\u2019s next? Glencore? Even BP? But here\u2019s one basic question about Sawan\u2019s thesis: is it even correct? Does the undervaluation, in terms of earnings and cashflow multiples, exist solely by virtue of the fact that Shell is listed in London? One doubts the story is as simple as that. It\u2019s not as if US investors currently have any difficulty buying shares in Shell, whether directly or through American depositary receipts. On the company\u2019s own numbers, 45% of its institutional register is already American versus 29% from the UK. Unlike Ferguson or CRH, there seems to be no difficulty getting noticed by American money. That is hardly surprising: we are talking here about a \u00a3180bn company. It seems unlikely the market would leave a 25% discount, which seems to be Shell\u2019s rough current analysis, on the table unless other factors were at work. The real explanation, perhaps, is that the stock market (sadly) is deeply sceptical about the pace of energy transition and the returns on capital in renewables. Thus, the most oily firms, such the two US titans, are prized over those with a sideline in renewables, such as Shell, which in turn is valued more highly than those with a slightly greener hue, such as BP. This price signal is terrifying from a climate perspective, but the point is that a mere relisting of Shell\u2019s shares wouldn\u2019t change the make-up of its assets. Maybe Sawan would like to water down further Shell\u2019s emission-reduction targets and thinks it would be easier to do so from the US. But if that\u2019s the case, he should say so openly. There is a strong whiff here that what Shell and Sawan really dislike is the climate policies of European governments. That is a separate argument to the questionable claim that the same earnings are valued wildly differently in different markets. The London Stock Exchange gets a lot of flak, including from this column, for its seeming lack of concern about departees and the lack of new arrivals. But on this occasion, one can feel some sympathy. Shell \u2013 possibly the most liquid, deeply researched and widely owned stock in town \u2013 seems to have alighted on the \u201cundervaluation\u201d theme without showing evidence that location is the problem in its case. In the LSE\u2019s shoes, you\u2019d be furious. Shell\u2019s loose \u201cmaybe we will, maybe we won\u2019t\u201d talk is seriously damaging."

            "content": "So ends a stock market experiment that is unlikely to be repeated in a hurry: Hipgnosis Songs Fund, the music royalties company with songs by the likes of Beyonc\u00e9, Blondie and Chic, is to be sold to a US fund for less than its starting price in 2018 of 100p. The immediate point is that 93p a share, or \u00a31.1bn, is a lot better than shareholders were looking at in recent months. The price went as low as 60p during the company\u2019s bust-up with its own investment adviser, a suspension of dividends (unforgivable for a fund designed to turn royalties into income) and a writedown in the value of assets after a tortuous debate about valuation methodologies. Those shareholders voted last year against \u201ccontinuation\u201d, in the lingo of investment trusts, which amounted to an order to the board to find a new strategy and establish some hard value. Robert Naylor came in as chair last November and has found a credible buyer in the form of Concord Chorus, a fund ultimately backed by state pension money in Michigan; the same US fund last year bought Round Hill Music, the only other UK-listed royalty fund. For Hipgnosis investors, 93p doesn\u2019t represent Good Times, to pick on one song in the portfolio, but nor is it a reason to (Le) Freak out. It\u2019s a smidgeon above the revised asset value; on the other hand, the asset value may increase by a notch or two by the time the deal completes. There is also an entertaining subplot whereby the fund is inviting its investment adviser \u2013 a firm majority-owned by Blackstone but with Hipgnosis pioneer Merck Mercuriadis on lead vocals \u2013 to go quietly by terminating its management contract, to allow an extra $25m (\u00a320m) to flow to shareholders. We\u2019ll wait to see how that request is received given the past toxicity of the relationship. But the longer-term point demonstrated by Hipgnosis\u2019s entertaining life as a FTSE 250 stock is that this type of \u201calternative\u201d asset is ill-suited to public markets. As soon as interest rates started to rise, the share price wobbled. Then came the kerfuffle over valuation techniques in an illiquid market for back catalogues, plus the tensions with Blackstone and Mercuriadis. And it all happened within the context of an industry-wide lack of transparency over the price at which catalogues are bought and sold. In the circumstances, Naylor is surely spot on when he says the fund would have to undergo \u201csubstantial financial and governance changes\u201d to improve its share price materially under its own steam, and that the alternatives \u201ccarry significant risks, uncertainties and limitations\u201d. You bet: in an investment trust sector where discounts to published asset values are already the norm, you don\u2019t want to add complications on top. Selling up at 93p is reasonable. Shareholders with a combined stake of 29% have already backed the decision. The shame is that the basic idea had appeal: a broad and constantly refreshed portfolio of music rights should be able to provide a stable source of income. But pension money, with its multi-decade investment horizons, looks a more natural owner, away from public markets. Hipgnosis was just too noisy."

            "date": "2024-04-25T20:47:26Z",
            "content": "America\u2019s leading stock indices came under pressure on Thursday after official data revealed that US economic growth slowed sharply to its weakest rate in almost two years. But as high interest rates take their toll on the world\u2019s largest economy, inflation continues to loom large. The Dow Jones industrial average fell by as much as 1.8% in New York before recovering to close down 1%. The S&amp;P 500 also dropped by as much as 1.5%, before finishing down 0.5%. The technology-focused Nasdaq declined 1.9%, before clawing back some of its losses to close down 0.6%. Gross domestic product increased at an annualized rate of 1.6% in the first quarter, significantly short of the 2.4% rate expected by economists. But a closely watched measure of inflation also rose faster than anticipated, raising questions about the Federal Reserve\u2019s next steps in its fight to bring down price growth. The so-called \u201ccore\u201d personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index \u2013 which strips out volatile food and energy costs \u2013 rose 3.7% in the first three months of the year, according to a report published by the commerce department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis. The same measure rose by 2% in the last quarter of 2023. While economists had expected an acceleration, the reading was higher than the average 3.4% forecast. Inflation has been easing in the US, with unemployment remaining low and growth largely resilient, raising hopes that the Fed will guide the world\u2019s largest economy to a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d, where price growth normalizes and recession is avoided. But Thursday\u2019s data on the first quarter \u2013 with growth fading, and inflation on the rise \u2013 will test this confidence. \u201cQ1\u2019s sluggish increase in GDP likely sets the tone for the rest of 2024,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, predicting that core PCE inflation \u201cwill rise at an annualized rate much closer to 2%\u201d over the next few months. The first quarter\u2019s core inflation reading could \u201cspook the Fed a little\u201d, said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. \u201cThe core PCE deflator rose 3.7% at an annualized rate in Q1, nearly double the clip seen in each of the prior two quarters and stronger than either we or the consensus anticipated.\u201d While inflation has slowed dramatically since peaking at its highest level in a generation two summers ago, prices still remain far higher than where they stood before the pandemic. The economy is at the heart of this year\u2019s presidential election campaign, as voters mull whether they felt better off under Joe Biden, or the Trump administration. \u201cThe landing is, and will be, soft,\u201d Biden declared during his State of the Union address last month. \u201cIt takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it. Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring.\u201d But Donald Trump, who is fighting to regain the presidency in November, has claimed inflation is \u201ckilling America\u201d under Biden. On Thursday Janet Yellen, Biden\u2019s treasury secretary, told Reuters that the US economy \u201ccontinues to perform very, very well\u201d, describing the latest growth as \u201cpeculiar, but not concerning\u201d.

            "date": "2024-04-25T13:46:10Z",
            "content": "Shareholders have voted in favour of doubling the pay packet of London Stock Exchange Group\u2019s chief executive to \u00a313m on the same day that fears were reignited about an exodus of UK-listed firms. Investors backed the group\u2019s plans to increase David Schwimmer\u2019s maximum pay levels from \u00a36.25m to more than \u00a313m. The resolution passed, with nearly 89% voting in favour of the new pay policy. The LSEG annual shareholder meeting was held as it emerged that two large UK-listed companies, Unilever and Anglo American, may leave the London market for lucrative deals and listings abroad. The Australian mining company BHP has a \u00a331bn offer for rival Anglo American, a move that could result in the cancellation of FTSE 100-listed firm\u2019s UK shares. Two years ago, BHP dropped its dual Australia-UK listing in favour of a single home on the Sydney stock exchange. Meanwhile, the chief executive of Unilever, Hein Schumacher, said the consumer goods company was \u201cconsidering all options\u201d for a potential listing of its ice-cream business, which makes brands including Magnum and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, and could be valued at up to \u20ac17bn (\u00a314.6bn). Schumacher said he was \u201ctalking to many different stakeholders in the process\u201d and had discussed a potential Amsterdam listing with the Dutch economic affairs minister. However, he did not confirm whether he met the equivalent UK minister, raising fears that London could miss out on another bumper stock market float. Schumacher added that he had \u201cregular conversations with governments including the UK government\u201d. There has been much handwringing in the City and Whitehall over an exodus of listed firms from the London stock market. Those leaving include the travel group Tui, which will shift its listing to Germany, and the Dublin-based betting firm Flutter, which is asking shareholders to consider moving its shares to the US market. Schwimmer tried to appear upbeat, telling shareholders on Thursday the pipeline of floats was \u201cencouraging\u201d and that a pending shake-up of listings rules, which include simplifying some requirements for companies, would be helpful. \u201cWe are very pleased with the direction of travel for the London market,\u201d he said. The influential shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis had advised shareholders to reject Schwimmer\u2019s pay policy, saying in a report this month that the company had not \u201csufficiently rationalised an increase of this magnitude in a lump sum approach, particularly given the CEO\u2019s pay relative to UK peers\u201d. However, Schwimmer had argued that the group had to compete with peers in the US, where executives can expect much higher renumeration. \u201cIf London has an ambition to be a globally leading financial centre and to attract world-class companies, that means it has to attract world-class talent,\u201d he said in February. LSEG said this month that it was \u201cfocused on securing and retaining the calibre of talent required in a highly competitive global market\u201d while \u201censuring delivery of strong performance\u201d was rewarded."

            "date": "2024-04-24T16:26:15Z",
            "content": "Former president Donald Trump qualified for a bonus worth $1.2bn after shares in his social media company remained above a certain value despite falling sharply. Trump is poised to receive 36m additional shares in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG), owner of his Truth Social platform, under an \u201cearn-out\u201d windfall which boosts the paper value of his stake in the business to about $3.7bn. He was able to receive the bonus if TMTG\u2019s stock traded above $17.50 a share for 20 days out of any 30-day period within the first three years of the firm\u2019s stock market debut \u2013 a milestone it reached after closing at $32.57 on Tuesday. Trump\u2019s shares in his social media company have offered him a financial lifeline as he faces about $500m in legal penalties after being found liable in civil fraud, defamation and sexual abuse cases. While he cannot sell his stock until September due to the terms of a lockup agreement, the shares\u2019 fluctuating value have at times made him one of the world\u2019s wealthiest people on paper. After a stunning landing on New York\u2019s Nasdaq stock exchange, the value of Trump\u2019s social media company \u2013 which trades as DJT \u2013 has fallen drastically. The stock hit a high of almost $80 on its opening day, but declined in fits in the following weeks. Trump Media\u2019s CEO, Devin Nunes, has suggested that short sellers betting on the loss of value may have been responsible for manipulating the stock. Shares in Trump Media tanked further last week, falling 12% after the company revealed it could sell millions of additional shares in the coming months. They fell another 8% on Tuesday, even as they enabled Trump to qualify for his earn-out shares. The company has also faced political scrutiny over the firm\u2019s financial backers. A Democratic-aligned group issued a call earlier this month for lawmakers to investigate the company over allegations of influence peddling, after the Guardian reported that a Russian-American businessman under federal criminal investigation helped prop up the company. Truth Social has become a personal soapbox for Trump to issue statements to his supporters since its launch in 2022. While its user base is tiny compared with more established social networks, such as X (formerly Twitter), the platform has outgrown other rightwing apps. Trump is now on trial in a Manhattan courtroom, with prosecutors alleging that he sought to undermine the 2016 presidential election through making illegal hush-money payments to cover up his affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump\u2019s defense lawyers have maintained he is innocent of all 34 felony counts of falsifying business documents, in what is the first criminal trial of a former president in US history."

            "content": "Prices in UK shops rose at their slowest rate since late 2021 in April as deep discounts by clothing and footwear retailers put the brakes on inflation, the latest snapshot of high street spending trends has shown. The monthly bulletin from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) \u2013 the lobby group for the industry \u2013 found that the battle by store owners to offload summer stock in cold and wet weather meant prices in non-food stores were lower this month than a year earlier. The BRC said the cost of non-food goods fell at an annual rate of 0.6% in April, while the price of food increased by 3.4%, down from 3.7% in March. Taken together, food and non-food inflation stood at 0.8% in April, compared to 1.3% in the year to March \u2013 the lowest level since December 2021. Data for the BRC\u2019s shop price bulletin was collected early in the month and points to another fall in the official inflation figure for April when it is released next month. Inflation peaked at 11.1% in October 2022 \u2013 the highest level in four decades \u2013 but has since been on a downward trend. In the year to March, the Office for National Statistics said prices rose by 3.2%, but the Bank of England expects lower energy bills to bring the annual inflation rate down to about 2% in April. Despite the easing of cost-of-living pressures, food prices are 25% higher than they were when Russia invaded Ukraine just over two years ago, while prices overall have increased by 14%. Helen Dickinson, the BRC chief executive, said shop price inflation levels were showing signs of normalising. She added: \u201cBoth food and non-food have seen shop inflation rates ease to more manageable levels. In April, non-food prices fell, especially in clothing and footwear, where retailers ramped up promotions to encourage consumer spend. \u201cFood inflation slowed for the 12th consecutive month as fresh products, such as butter, fish and fruits, continued to fall in price due to easing input costs and intense competition between grocers.\u201d Amid warnings from farmers that months of wet weather could lead to food shortages and higher prices, Dickinson said geo-political tension also posed a threat to price stability. \u201cRetailers will continue to do all they can to keep prices down, but government has a role to play with pro-growth policies that allow businesses to invest in the customer offer,\u201d she added."

            "date": "2024-04-10T13:07:26Z",
            "content": "Global financial markets have scaled back expectations for an imminent cut in interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic after figures showed US inflation rose by more than expected in March. Figures from the US Department of Labor show a jump in fuel and housing rental costs drove up the consumer price index (CPI) to 3.5% in March compared with a year earlier, higher than expected by Wall Street economists. In a development triggering a sell-off in financial markets, monthly inflation and core CPI \u2013 which removes volatile items including energy and food \u2013 also rose by more than predicted. US government bond yields rose sharply, while shares fell in New York amid speculation that stubborn inflationary pressures could force the US Federal Reserve to delay cutting interest rates. \u201cExpectations for a June Federal Reserve interest rate cut have collapsed,\u201d said James Knightley, chief international economist at the Dutch bank ING. \u201cJuly is also doubtful, meaning September is the more probable start point of any easing, which would limit the Fed to a maximum of just three rate cuts this year.\u201d The figures also led traders to slash bets for the Bank of England to cut borrowing costs in June, amid concerns that inflation in the US and the UK could persist at higher levels than previously thought. Financial markets are now pricing a 54% chance of the UK central bank keeping interest rates unchanged in June, having previously reflected a greater probability of a cut before the US inflation figures were released. Inflation in the world\u2019s largest economy has fallen sharply from a high of over 9% in 2022 but has remained stubbornly above the Fed\u2019s target rate of 2%. Inflation in the UK has fallen from over 10% last year to 3.4% in February. Figures for March are due to be published next week. The latest figures from the US show March\u2019s increase was driven by rising costs for shelter and gasoline. \u201cCombined, these two indexes contributed over half of the monthly increase in the index,\u201d the labor department said. Gasoline rose 1.7% from the previous month and is 1.3% higher than the same time last year. Shelter is 5.7% higher than a year ago and rose 0.4% over the month. Ryan Stewart, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, pointed out that gasoline prices typically rise this time of year. \u201cBut it still has economic costs as every $0.01 rise in retail gasoline prices reduces consumer spending between $1bn and $1.5bn over the course of a year,\u201d he wrote in a note to investors. The Fed increased its benchmark interest rate from near zero to over 5% over the last 16 months in a bid to cool inflation. Recently the central bank has held off on further rate rises and economists had expected rate cuts later this year. Those hopes have faded in recent weeks amid signs that inflation has remained sticky. The US central bank has a twin mandate \u2013 to keep prices under control and achieve maximum employment. The jobs market has remained robust despite the Fed\u2019s attempts to cool the economy, adding 303,000 positions last month. The inflation news will further complicate November\u2019s US elections, as Joe Biden attempts to point to progress in the American economy. Nearly 15.2m jobs have been created since he took office and unemployment has remained below 4% for the longest stretch in 50 years. Meanwhile stock markets have hit record highs and inflation \u2013 while above the Fed\u2019s target \u2013 has fallen sharply. But polling shows that voters are unhappy with the president\u2019s economic stewardship, inflation and high interest rates. Some economists are now predicting that the Fed may not begin cutting rates until after the election. In a statement, Biden said: \u201cToday\u2019s report shows inflation has fallen more than 60% from its peak, but we have more to do to lower costs for hardworking families. Prices are still too high for housing and groceries, even as prices for key household items like milk and eggs are lower than a year ago.\u201d Biden called on corporations to use their \u201crecord profits to reduce prices\u201d and attacked Republicans who he said \u201cwant to slash taxes for billionaires and big corporations, while helping special interests and big pharma raise prices\u201d. On his social media site Truth Social, Biden\u2019s presidential rival Donald Trump wrote: \u201cINFLATION is BACK\u2014and RAGING! The Fed will never be able to credibly lower interest rates, because they want to protect the worst President in the history of the Untied [sic] States!\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-01T23:01:19Z",
            "content": "Inflation in shop prices in the UK has eased to the lowest level for more than two years after retailers cut prices on Easter treats, clothing and electrical goods amid a slowdown in spending by consumers in the cost of living crisis. Industry figures show prices rose at an annual rate of 1.3% in March, down from a rate of 2.5% in February \u2013 the slowest pace since December 2021, according to the latest monitor from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) trade body and the market research firm NielsenIQ. Non-food inflation dived to just 0.2% from 1.3% in the previous month, while food inflation fell to 3.7% from 5%. The figures come amid growing hopes that the worst of the toughest increase in inflation for 40 years has passed, with anticipation that the Bank of England could begin cutting interest rates within months to ease pressure on households. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said inflation had fallen back amid fierce competition between retailers to entice consumer spending, as hard-pressed households cut back to make ends meet. \u201cWhile Easter treats were more expensive than in previous years due to high global cocoa and sugar prices, retailers provided cracking deals on popular chocolates, which led to price falls compared to the previous month,\u201d she said. \u201cDairy prices also fell on the month as farm gate prices eased, and retailers worked hard to lower prices for many essentials. In non-food, prices of electricals, clothing and footwear fell as retailers increased promotions to entice consumer spending.\u201d Competition has stepped up as households continue to rein in spending on non-essentials amid high energy bills and food costs as well as increases in mortgages and rents as a result of higher interest rates. The advisory firm BDO\u2019s regular survey of mid-sized retailers, many of which are fashion chains, found shoppers spent about 2% less in equivalent stores in the week to 24 March compared with the same week a year before, with homewares and fashion hit particularly hard. In-store sales were poor despite more people visiting shopping destinations, where footfall was up by about 2%. Mike Watkins, the head of retailer insight at NielsenIQ, said that a key driver of easing inflation was weaker growth in food prices: \u201cA year ago, food inflation was 15% so this was to be expected. But it is also helped by intense competition among the supermarkets as they look to drive footfall, with focused price cuts and promotional offers earlier in the month for Mother\u2019s Day and now again in the weeks leading up to Easter.\u201d The fall in shop prices will increase hopes that overall inflation is dropping closer to the Bank of England target of 2%. The Bank is forecasting that headline inflation as measured by the consumer prices index will fall below that level in April. However, a drop in the rate of inflation does not mean the overall cost of living will fall \u2013 prices will continue to rise but at a slower pace than over the past year. Financial markets expect Threadneedle Street to begin cutting rates from the current level of 5.25% from as early as May or June. Such a development would be seized on by Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, as evidence of progress in the economy as the Conservatives battle to overturn a commanding Labour lead in opinion polls. However, Dickinson warned that increases in the legal minimum wage and business rates for many firms, combined with additional Brexit-related border checks and new recycling plans \u201ccould put progress on bringing down inflation at risk\u201d. These costs include a 6.7% business rates rise, recycling proposals and new border checks. The national living wage also increased from Monday from \u00a310.42 an hour to \u00a311.44 an hour, the largest funding increase for more than a decade. \u201cThe industry needs pro-growth government policy that supports investment and helps keep down prices for households up and down the country,\u201d she said."

            "content": "The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has shrugged off a smaller-than-expected drop in inflation last month, saying he expected a sharp fall towards the government\u2019s 2% target next month. Speaking in Washington after news that the government\u2019s preferred measure of the cost of living had eased from 3.4% in February to 3.2%, Bailey said the path of inflation was broadly in line with what Threadneedle Street had predicted in its quarterly health check on the economy. Financial markets had predicted a bigger drop in the annual rate in March to 3.1% and saw the latest data on price pressures as putting back the timing of interest rate cuts. But Bailey said: \u201cWe are pretty much on track with where we thought we would be \u2013 a bit under in February and a bit over in the latest figures. Next month will see quite a strong drop.\u201d While the UK was experiencing strong disinflation, the governor said the fall was unbalanced. He said that in April household energy bills were likely to be 25% lower than a year earlier, but service sector inflation is running at 6%. Decisions on interest rates would be influenced by service sector inflation, earnings growth and the state of the labour market, he said. \u201cIt looks like we are getting a loosening of the labour market,\u201d Bailey said after this week\u2019s news of a rise in the unemployment rate to 4.2%. \u201cBut we are disinflating at full employment.\u201d Bailey\u2019s comments followed the release of data showing the annual inflation rate at its lowest level since September 2021 \u2013 helped by food prices rising more slowly than a year earlier. Jeremy Hunt said: \u201cThe plan is working: inflation is \u2026 down from over 11% to 3.2%, the lowest level in nearly two and a half years, helping people\u2019s money go further.\u201d Speaking in Washington on Wednesday night, the chancellor said the economy had achieved a \u201csoft landing\u201d and been transformed since Rishi Sunak became prime minister. Asked whether he was disappointed that there had been no improvement in the Conservative party\u2019s poll ratings despite falling inflation, Hunt said: \u201cHow people feel is subjective and beyond my control. All I can do is take the right decisions about the fundamentals of the British economy. I think those have been transformed in the period since Rishi Sunak became prime minister.\u201d Hunt said that when he arrived at the Treasury in late 2022, the Bank of England was predicting the longest recession in 100 years and the Office for Budget Responsibility was expecting a record drop in living standards. \u201cIt looks like we have achieved a soft landing,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cLiving standards have risen, not fallen.\u201d Investors reacted to the March figure by trimming bets for an imminent reduction in borrowing costs, pricing in the first quarter-point rate cut in September or November. A matter of weeks ago, investors had been expecting a first cut in June. The Bank has raised interest rates to 5.25% as it tries to bring CPI inflation back down to its target of 2%. However, on Wednesday, Megan Greene, an independent economist on the Bank\u2019s nine-strong rate-setting committee, told an event in Washington that recent tensions in the Middle East could pose a risk to achieving that aim, including by heightening inflation expectations. \u201cI do think that what\u2019s going on in the Middle East does pose a risk,\u201d Greene told the Institute of International Finance. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the sort of an energy price shock and other supply-side shock, which obviously follow a number of supply-side shocks we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years, and what that might do to inflation expectations.\u201d The ONS said cooling inflation in food and drink prices contributed most to the decline, after a fall in the prices of bakery products including chocolate biscuits and crumpets. However, this was offset by rising fuel prices and stubbornly high inflation in services prices. A reduction in the rate of inflation does not mean that prices are falling, just that they are rising more slowly. The latest snapshot showed consumer prices continuing to rise across a broad range of categories, including car insurance, which soared by almost 30% compared with a year earlier. The cost of mobile phone and broadband packages also shot up and prices for hotels, beer and other alcoholic drinks rose as well. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said the figures showed households remained worse off. \u201cPrices are still high in the shops, monthly mortgage bills are going up and inflation is still higher than the Bank of England\u2019s target,\u201d she said. The latest snapshot from the ONS showed that core inflation \u2013 which excludes energy, food and tobacco prices and is closely monitored by the Bank \u2013 slowed to 4.2% from 4.5% in February, but remained higher than forecast by City economists and the Bank. Services inflation, which the Bank also watches closely, eased slightly to 6% from 6.1% a month earlier, but was also marginally higher than predicted."

This poses a conundrum for central bankers who have made it clear they want to see further evidence that inflation is cooling before they cut interest rates. The Fed\u2019s high interest rates haven\u2019t pushed America to the brink of a recession, fortunately, but they haven\u2019t slowed inflation as much as policymakers had hoped. The question is whether Fed officials can cut interest rates at all this year. Joe Biden acknowledged that \u201cprices are still too high for housing and groceries\u201d, and said he was \u201ccalling on corporations, including grocery retailers, to use record profits to reduce prices\u201d. What\u2019s the president getting at? Corporate profits reached a record high in the fourth quarter of last year. The easiest explanation for record corporate profits at the same time prices remain elevated is that corporations have enough monopoly power to keep prices high. (Note that many corporations are also shrinking the size of the products you\u2019re buying without lowering their prices \u2013 a variant of the same thing.) This is one of the biggest reasons the American public is not yet crediting Biden with a great economy. Most people still aren\u2019t feeling it. In 2023, PepsiCo\u2019s chief financial officer said that even though inflation was dropping, its prices would not be. Pepsi hiked its prices by double digits and announced plans to keep them high in 2024. If Pepsi were challenged by tougher competition, consumers would just buy something cheaper. But PepsiCo\u2019s only major soda competitor is Coca-Cola, which \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 announced similar price hikes at about the same time as Pepsi and has also kept its prices high. The CEO of Coca-Cola claimed that the company had \u201cearned the right\u201d to push price hikes because its sodas are popular. Popular? The only thing that\u2019s popular these days seems to be corporate price gouging. We\u2019re seeing this pattern across much of the economy \u2013 especially with groceries. At the end of 2023, Americans were paying at least 30% more for beef, pork and poultry products than they were in 2020. Why? Near-monopoly power. Just four companies now control processing of 80% of beef, nearly 70% of pork, and almost 60% of poultry. So of course it\u2019s easy for them to coordinate price increases. The problem goes well beyond the grocery store. In 75% of US industries, fewer companies now control more of their markets than they did 20 years ago. What should be done? First, antitrust laws must be enforced. Kudos to the Biden administration for enforcing antitrust more aggressively than any administration in the last 40 years. This administration has taken action against alleged price fixing in the meat industry \u2013 which has been a problem for decades. The Biden administration has sued to block the merger of Kroger and Albertsons \u2013 two giant grocery chains. Kroger operates 2,750 stores in 35 states and the District of Columbia. The company\u2019s 19 brands include Ralphs, Smith\u2019s, King Soopers, Fred Meyer, Food 4 Less, Mariano\u2019s, Pick \u2019n Save, and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states. Its 15 brands include Safeway, Jewel-Osco, Vons, Acme and Shaw\u2019s. Together, Kroger and Albertsons employ around 700,000 people. The Biden administration is suing Amazon for using its dominance to artificially jack up prices, in one of the biggest anti-monopoly lawsuits in a generation. The Biden administration is suing Apple for using its market power to control its apps and prevent other businesses from offering them. The administration successfully sued to block the merger of JetBlue and Spirit Airlines, which would have made consolidation in the airline industry even worse. But given how concentrated American industry has become, there\u2019s still a long way to go. Biden should make his antitrust enforcement against corporate power a centerpiece of his campaign. Second, big corporations must not be allowed to use their power to gouge consumers. Senator Elizabeth Warren and others recently unveiled the latest version of their Price Gouging Prevention Act. \u201cGiant corporations are using supply chain shocks as a cover to excessively raise prices and sometimes charging the same price but shrinking how much consumers actually get,\u201d Warren charges. The bill would empower the Federal Trade Commission (which would also get $1bn in additional funding) and state attorneys general to stop companies from charging \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d prices, regardless of where alleged price gouging took place in a supply chain. The legislation would also protect small businesses \u2013 those earning less than $100m \u2013 from litigation if they had to raise prices in good faith during crises, and require public companies to disclose more about their costs and pricing strategies. I don\u2019t have any illusions that this bill will find its way into law soon. Democrats hold a slim majority in the Senate, and not all Democrats support it. Meanwhile, Republicans and their business backers are dead set against it \u2013 and are eager to blame continued high prices on Biden, not on corporations. But this bill is just as necessary as aggressive antitrust enforcement \u2013 and an example of what could and will be done if Democrats sweep the 2024 elections. The record profits of large corporations are coming out of the paychecks of average Americans, who are still struggling to get by. Biden and the Democrats must say this loudly and clearly and tell the public what they are doing \u2013 and will do \u2013 to stop corporate monopolies and price gouging.

            "content": "The eurozone has bounced back from its shallow technical recession after a stronger than expected performance by its \u201cbig four\u201d economies in the first three months of 2024. After two successive quarters of 0.1% contraction in the second half of 2023, the 20 nations that use the single currency posted growth of 0.3% between January and March. Figures from the European Commission\u2019s statistical agency \u2013 Eurostat \u2013 showed the eurozone had put in its best growth performance since the third quarter of 2022. Financial markets had been expecting 0.2% growth. Lower energy prices, falling inflation, rising real wages and the prospect of cuts in interest rates helped to boost activity after a downbeat 2023 in which the eurozone only grew in one quarter. Europe\u2019s two biggest economies \u2013 Germany and France \u2013 grew by 0.2%, while Italy and Spain posted growth of 0.3% and 0.7% respectively. Germany\u2019s performance in the final three months of 2023 was worse than originally thought: the economy contracted by 0.5% rather than 0.3%. Of the smaller EU economies, the best performing were Ireland, which grew by 1.1% in the first three months of 2024, and Latvia, Lithuania and Hungary, which expanded by 0.8%. Separate Eurostat data showed headline eurozone inflation remained unchanged in April at 2.4%, while core inflation \u2013 which excludes energy and food \u2013 came down from 2.9% to 2.7%. Although the eurozone\u2019s growth performance in the first quarter was stronger than the European Central Bank had been forecasting, analysts said lower inflation paved the way for interest rate cuts in the months ahead. Sam Miley, the managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: \u201cThis morning\u2019s confirmation of quarterly growth in the first quarter has put an end to a short-lived recession in the eurozone, with the economy having turned a corner since the beginning of 2024. \u201cProspects are likely to improve further throughout the year, driven by the expectation of interest rate cuts.\u201d Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cWhile the eurozone\u2019s mild recession appears to be over, we think the economy will expand at only a moderate pace over the rest of the year.\u201d Some of the improvement in the first three months of 2024 was due to temporary factors, such as a rebound in construction, while business surveys also pointed to sluggish growth, Kenningham said. UK first quarter growth figures are due out next week, with the financial markets anticipating 0.3% growth and an end to the mild recession recorded in the second half of 2023. Figures from the Bank of England showed mortgage approvals for house purchases rose from 60,500 in February to 61,300 in March, taking them to the highest level since September 2022. The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee will make its latest decision on interest rates next week, but is expected to leave official borrowing costs unchanged at 5.25%. \u2022 This article was amended on 1 May 2024. An earlier version said that Hungary was in the eurozone instead of in the EU."

            "content": "Time to wrap up\u2026. here\u2019s the main stories, on the day the eurozone bounced out of its technical recession, and take-up of UK mortgages rose. France\u2019s central bank governor has suggested the European Central Bank now has the confidence it needs to cut interest rates at its next meeting in early June. Reuters has the details: French and euro-zone inflation data released on Tuesday gives confidence the European Central Bank will be able to start lowering interest rates in early June, ECB member and Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on social network Linkedin. As we covered this morning, eurozone annual inflation was unchanged at 2.4%, close to the ECB\u2019s 2% target, while France\u2019s inflation rate slipped to just 2.2%. This year\u2019s early Easter helped the eurozone to beat growth expectations in the first quarter of the year, say analysts at ABN AMRO. They told clients today: Eurozone GDP growth came in at 0.3% qoq in 2024Q1, stronger than our and consensus expectations for a more modest 0.1% rise. Today\u2019s upward surprise comes after a 5 quarter period in which the bloc\u2019s economy stagnated. We only have details for some individual countries, but based on this and monthly aggregate data the strength was probably driven by net exports, services consumption (partly due to the earlier timing of easter), and stronger construction activity due to the mild winter. Looking ahead, we expect GDP growth be somewhat weaker again in Q2 as some of the temporary supports for activity unwind, but we continue to expect a more sustained recovery in the second half of this year, supported by rising real incomes and easier financial conditions. Home prices across the US have continued to climb, despite Americans facing higher mortgage costs. The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index shows that US house price rose by 6.4% in the year to February, up from 6% in January. Prices in the 10 largest cities jumped by 8% per year, up from 7.4%. \u201cFollowing last year\u2019s decline, U.S. home prices are at or near all-time highs,\u201d says Brian D. Luke, Head of Commodities, Real &amp; Digital Assets at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. He explains: \u201cOur National Composite rose by 6.4% in February, the fastest annual rate since November 2022. Our 10- and 20-City Composite indices are currently at all-time highs. For the third consecutive month, all cities reported increases in annual prices, with four currently at all-time highs: San Diego, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York. On a seasonal adjusted basis, our National, 10- and 20- City Composite indices continue to break through previous all-time highs set last year.\u201d Over in the US, wages are rising faster than the country\u2019s central bank would like. US wages and salaries increased by 1.1% in the first quarter of this year, matching the growth in the two previous quarters. And in the 12 months to March, wages and salaries increased by 4.4%, and by 4.3% for private industry workers. The persistence of wage growth could encourage the US Federal Reserve to take its time on rate cuts. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, points out that productivity growth is an important factor: The big question is whether wage growth is low enough to be consistent with hitting the 2% price inflation target on a sustained basis? 4.3% is still well above the pre-Covid average, but productivity growth is also significantly higher. Property experts are hailing this morning\u2019s news showing that UK mortgage approvals hit their highest for 18 months in March. Anthony Codling, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says rising mortgage approvals are good news for housebuilders: Given the recent increases in mortgage rates it was comforting to see mortgage approvals rise in March by 1.3% (seasonally adjusted) to 61,300, a level 20% higher than they were one year ago. We continue to believe that the UK housing market is slowly recovering even in the face of stubborn economic, mortgage rate headwinds, and election date uncertainty. But, there are also forecasts that the recovery will tail off, as borrowers are facing rising mortgage rates. Hina Bhudia, partner at Knight Frank Finance, says the recovery in housing market activity continued into March: At 61,300, mortgage approvals for house purchase are now approaching the 65,000 or so monthly approvals we saw during the three years leading up to the pandemic. \u201cThe market is currently dominated by buyers that really need to move, and that\u2019s unlikely to change in the near-term. Mortgage rates are rising once again, and both Natwest and Santander raised rates on their product ranges this morning. \u201cThat will inevitably cause some would-be buyers to sit out this spring selling season, which should be gathering pace this week. The sun is out and buyers are returning from their Easter break, so we\u2019d usually expect these to be the busy weeks before the summer, however the uncertain outlook for mortgage rates will undoubtedly weigh on activity. \u201cIt\u2019s not just buyers that are frustrated. The lenders are eager to rebuild their businesses after a subdued 2023, however they are constrained by stubborn inflation and the resulting impact on their cost of funding.\u201d Peter Arnold, EY UK chief economist, warns that mortgage rates are set to edge up further, as the impact of higher swap rates feeds through. That means the recovery in mortgage approvals will continue to cool, Arnold predicts: \u201cThe recovery in mortgage demand continued in March, with approvals for new house purchases rising to 61,325, an 18-month high. However, the increase in mortgage interest rates over recent months appears to have taken some of the momentum out of the recovery, with the rise in approvals between February and March being much smaller than the previous two months. Net mortgage lending slipped to just \u00a30.3bn in March, from \u00a31.6bn in February, but February\u2019s outturn had been flattered by a temporary slump in repayments. \u201cWith swap rates having climbed further during April, and mortgage rates continuing to edge up in response, the EY ITEM Club expects the recovery in approvals to continue to cool in the near-term. Canada has joined the GDP party, but its growth figures are a bit of a damp squib. Canadian growth slowed in February, with GDP rising by 0.2% in February \u2013 weaker than the 0.3% expected \u2013 following a 0.5% gain in January. Statistics Canada says: Services-producing industries (+0.2%) led the growth for a second month in a row, fuelled by gains in transportation and warehousing. The goods-producing industries aggregate was essentially unchanged as the mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector expanded while the utilities and manufacturing sectors contracted in February. Statistics Canada also estimates that Canada\u2019s economy expanded 0.6% in the first quarter of 2024 \u2013 which would be twice as fast as the eurozone. The FTSE 100 share index has touched a new alltime high today, as its rally continues. The index of major blue-chip companies listed in London hit 8199.95 points for the first time today, above yesterday\u2019s record high of 8189.14 points. Premier Inn owner Whitbread is the top riser, up 4.6%, after hiking its dividend, announcing a \u00a3150m share buyback plan and 1,500 job cuts. HSBC are also rallying, up 4% after beating profit forecasts this morning. Fiona Cincotta, senior financial market analyst at City Index, says: The FTSE 100 is rising on Tuesday and is set to record its second straight month of gains, boosted by upbeat corporate earnings and despite mixed data from China. HSBC is up 2.5% after the bank posted better-than-expected pretax profits and announced a $3 billion share buyback, offsetting the news that CEO No Quinn will retire. The Asian-focused bank posted a 3% rise in revenue to $20.8 billion, well ahead of the $16.94 forecast. Pre-tax profit was $12.65 billion, down 2% annually, but still ahead of estimates. Adding to the good news, the British Retail Consortium noted that inflation was easing in the UK as shop prices rose at the slowest pace in more than two years in April. The data adds to signs that inflationary pressures are cooling, which could bring some relief to the Bank of England as policymakers consider when to start cutting interest rates. Heavyweight miners were in edging higher after Chinese factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in 14 months in April thanks to rising new export orders. In a busy day for growth data, Mexico\u2019s economy has expanded by 0.2% in the last quarter, beating forecasts for stagnation. On an annual basis, though, growth slowed to 1.6% per year, missing forecasts of 2.1%: The fast-food restaurant business McDonald\u2019s has missed sales forecasts as boycotts over war in the Middle East hit its takings. McDonald\u2019s has reported that global sales rose by 1.9% in January-March, missing Wall Street\u2019s forecast of a 2.1% increase. McDonald\u2019s says that like-for-like sales in its international markets division were slightly negative, falling by 0.2%, as the segment \u201ccontinued to be impacted by the war in the Middle East\u201d. CEO Chris Kempczinski says: Our global comparable sales growth in the first quarter marks 13 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth with 30% growth over the last four years. As consumers are more discriminating with every dollar that they spend, we will continue to earn their visits by delivering leading, reliable, everyday value and outstanding execution in our restaurants. McDonald\u2019s has been hit by boycotts across the Middle East and in Muslim-majority markets like Indonesia and Malaysia since October, AP reports, when its Israel franchise announced shortly after the Hamas attack of 7 October that it would be donating free meals to the Israeli military. McDonald\u2019s took control of this franchise from Alonyal Ltd at the start of April. The eurozone has bounced back from its shallow technical recession after a stronger than expected performance by its \u201cbig four\u201d economies in the first three months of 2024. After two successive quarters of 0.1% contraction in the second half of 2023, the 20 nations that use the single currency posted growth of 0.3% between January and March, my colleague Larry Elliott writes. Figures from the European Commission\u2019s statistical agency \u2013 Eurostat \u2013 showed the eurozone had put in its best growth performance since the third quarter of 2022. Financial markets had been expecting 0.2% growth. Lower energy prices, falling inflation, rising real wages and the prospect of cuts in interest rates helped to boost activity after a downbeat 2023 in which the eurozone only grew in one quarter. More here. In the currency markets, Japan appears to have burned through $35bn supporting the yen yesterday. Bank of Japan data suggests Japanese officials may have spent some 5.5 trillion yen ($35.06bn) supporting the currency on Monday, Reuters flags. The intervention came after the yen dropped to a 34-year low of 160 yen to the dollar, and helped it strengthen back to around 155/$, Japanese officials have not said whether they intervened. The yen has dropped by around 11% against the US dollar this year. It has come under pressure even though the Bank of Japan raised interest rates out of negative territory in March. Traders are wagering that the BoJ will be cautious about raising interest rates higher, while the dollar is benefiting from bets that the US Federal Reserve will be cautious about cutting US rates this year. That is putting pressure on the yen. Anglo American\u2019s chairman, Stuart Chambers, has assured shareholders over the company\u2019s future resilience days after rejecting the \u00a331bn takeover proposal from larger rival BHP. He told shareholders gathered for the company\u2019s Annual General Meeting in London today that the board had unanimously agreed to oppose BHP\u2019s \u201copportunistic\u201d approach in the \u201cclearest terms\u201d because it undervalued the company. When questioned by one shareholder, Chambers said the UK\u2019s takeover code meant the board would be unable to elaborate on its decision beyond the statement it released on Friday. \u201cBut I will be meeting with shareholders and listening very carefully, particularly [to] the larger ones in the top 30 of the register, to hear what they feel,\u201d Chambers said. He added: \u201cThe board doesn\u2019t buy or sell the company - the shareholders decide.\u201d Back in the UK, more than 400 jobs are at risk as the consumer healthcare company Haleon plans to shut a manufacturing site in Berkshire. Haleon is planning to shut down its manufacturing site in Maidenhead by 2026, a move which will affect 435 jobs. That factory makes Haleon products such as Sensodyne toothpaste and Parodontax mouthwash. A Haleon spokesperson told Reuters: Following a strategic review of our global manufacturing capabilities, we have determined that our Maidenhead site is no longer a viable option for the manufacture of our products. The Guardian reported in July last year that Haleon was planning widespread layoffs in the UK and around the world, a year after being spun off from Britain\u2019s second-biggest drugmaker GSK. The Eurozone economy exited stagnation \u201cwith a bang rather than a whimper\u201d, says Moody\u2019s Analytics\u2019 senior economist Kamil Kovar. Kovar says the \u201calmost normal above-consensus growth of 0.3%\u201d could encourage the European Central Bank to take cautious approach to interest rate cuts: This confirms that 2024 will mark the long-postponed recovery in euro zone. However, it was not all cheers, with details showing some weakness beneath the strong headline figure: consumptions was still weak in many places, and only strong construction, driven by warm weather, and increase in net exports ensured the strong number. Still, the ECB hawks will point to the strong GDP number as argument that ECB can take its rates lower gradually. A June cut will still occur, but a further cut in July just became bit more unlikely.\u201d There\u2019s not much financial market reaction to the eurozone\u2019s better-than-expected growth report. The euro has gained about 0.06% to $1.0725 against the US dollar against this morning. It\u2019s gained 0.2% against the pound, dragging sterling down to \u20ac1.1694. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, says: The euro is back above $1.0720 vs. the US dollar after stronger than expected European GDP for Q1. Quarterly GDP rose by 0.3%, which was stronger than the 0.1% expected, and \u2018bounced\u2019 back from the -0.1% dip in growth registered in Q4. Growth was broad-based across the currency bloc. However, southern European economies continue to outperform their Northern counterparts. But, this is unlikely to influence the European Central Bank, Brooks argues: The interest rate futures market is still expecting the ECB to cut rates in June, due to the April inflation print, which was in line with expectations at 2.4%. Core prices were slightly higher than expected at 2.7%, however this is still lower than the 2.9% recorded for March and the lowest level for nearly 2 years. German and French CPI also registered 2.4% annual CPI growth, which is within touching distance of the ECB\u2019s 2% target. Today\u2019s economic data out of the Eurozone point to an improving picture, reports Daniele Antonucci, chief investment officer at Quintet Private Bank: Looking at the change relative to the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the beat versus consensus exceeds the highest prediction in the key polls of forecasters. That\u2019s the glass-half-full story, especially following the shallow recession the region has gone through in the second half of last year, though the caveat is that consumer spending across many European countries remains quite feeble. The glass-half-empty story is that the pace of growth remains rather anaemic, with the forward-looking indicators pointing to moderately positive economic conditions. The contrast with the US, where domestic demand looks resilient and GDP growth appears to be re-accelerating, is stark. This is important when prospects for the overall economy are seen in the context of the inflation data that is coming in. In the US, inflation has surprised to the upside lately. In the Eurozone, today\u2019s data show a sideways trajectory for overall inflation, in line with expectations and lower in absolute terms than in the US. Although 0.3% quarterly growth isn\u2019t exactly stellar, it\u2019s the eurozone\u2019s strongest quarterly growth since the third quarter of 2022, early in Europe\u2019s energy crisis. Bert Colijn, ING\u2019s senior eurozone economist, says the eurozone economy has clearly entered a better phase with economic recovery, low unemployment and more moderate inflation. Lower energy prices, following the surge in oil and gas after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, are helping the economy. Colijn explains: The economy is profiting from a more stable energy supply, with costs having substantially eased, resulting in lower inflation. Wage growth, in turn, has accelerated to make up for lost purchasing power, which is currently benefiting consumers. We have yet to get the details, but judging from what\u2019s happening in France, we see that household consumption led the way The eurozone is set to grow faster this year than in 2023, predicts Sam Miley, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research: This morning\u2019s confirmation of quarterly growth in Q1 has put an end to a short-lived recession in the Eurozone, with the economy having turned a corner since the beginning of 2024. Prospects are likely to improve further throughout the year, driven by the expectation of interest rate cuts. Further data released this morning showed that inflation has now stood within one percentage point of target for seven consecutive months, suggesting a suitable environment for the European Central Bank to consider adopting looser monetary policy. Such policy changes will support growth this year. Cebr expects the Eurozone economy to expand by 0.6% in 2024, up from 2023\u2019s growth figure of 0.4%. The eurozone economy is \u201cmoving along nicely\u201d, says Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors, following today\u2019s GDP data. Inflation in the eurozone came in as expected but is proving to be stickier than might have been hoped for, mirroring experiences elsewhere. The economy is moving along nicely though, meaning that, all in all, the ECB will be able to stay on track to be the first of the major central banks to push the \u201ccut\u201d button on interest rates, probably in June. The prospects for the Eurozone are on the up, at a time when there is doubt creeping in for other economies\u2019 prospects. Here\u2019s Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, on today\u2019s eurozone data: Inflation across the eurozone was unchanged in April. Eurostat reports that consumer price inflation was 2.4% per year, matching March\u2019s reading. Services inflation did slow, to 3.7% from 4% in March, but food, alcohol &amp; tobacco inflation picked up to 2.8% from 2.6%. Non-energy industrial goods prices rose by 0.9%, down from 1.1%. Energy has less of a deflationary effect, though, with prices down by 0.6% year-on-year, from -1.8% in March. Disappointingly, core inflation fell by less than expected. Inflation, stripping out energy, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco, fell to 2.7% per year in April, down from 2.9%, but ahead of forecasts of a larger fall to 2.6%. NEWSFLASH: The eurozone has escaped recession, and beaten forecasts for growth at the start of this year. GDP across the eurozone expanded by 0.3% in January-March, statistics body Eurostat reports. This means the eurozone\u2019s shallow recession is over \u2013 its GDP shrank by 0.1% in both the third and fourth quarters of last year, which was a technical recession. Eurozone growth has been held back by high interest rates, as the European Central Bank has battled inflation, while the cost of living crisis hit consumer spending. Euro area GDP was lifted by stronger-than-expected growth in Germany, France, Italy and Spain (as we\u2019ve been blogging since early this morning). The wider European Union also grew by 0.3%. Eurostat says: Ireland (+1.1%) recorded the highest increase compared to the previous quarter, followed by Latvia, Lithuania and Hungary (all +0.8%). Sweden (-0.1%) was the only Member State that recorded a decrease compared to the previous quarter. The year on year growth rates were positive for nine countries and negative for four. France got the day off to a good start by reporting growth of 0.2% \u2013 which was hailed by its economy minister \u2013 before Spain posted a sizzling 0.7% growth. Germany then matched France, with 0.2% growth, while Italy expanded its GDP by 0.3%. In the UK, mortgage approvals are at their highest level since the chaos of Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget. New Bank of England data show that lenders approved 61,300 in March, up from 60,500 in February, which is the highest total since September 2022. There was also some relief for borrowers; the \u2018effective\u2019 interest rate \u2013 which is the actual interest paid \u2013 on newly drawn mortgages decreased by 17 basis points, to 4.73% in March. Getting back to eurozone GDP\u2026 and Portugal has grown as a steady pace at the start of this year. Portugal\u2019s GDP grew by 0.7% in Q1 2024, the same rate as in Q4 2023, and was 1.4% larger than a year ago. Earlier this month, Portugal\u2019s new centre-right government predicted the economy would grow 1.5% in 2024. It is planning to roll out tax cuts for the middle class in an effort to spur growth and investment. The German sportswear brand Adidas has benefited from a sales pick-up in Europe and China that helped it to overcome a slowdown in the US. Adidas has reported that sales in Europe increased by 14% in the last quarter, while they grew by 8% in Greater China, but fell by 4% in North America. Adidas CEO Bj\u00f8rn Gulden reported that sales, gross margin, and operating profit were all better than expected, and warned that \u201cmarkets are still volatile and not easy\u201d. Gulden adds: We now look forward to celebrate the great sports events like the Euro 2024, Copa Am\u00e9rica, the Olympics and Paralympics. It is a great year for sports \u2013 let us all enjoy it! Next stop, Italy \u2013 where growth has accelerated at the start of this year. Italian GDP grew by 0.3% in January-March, statistics body ISTAT reports, comfortably ahead of forecasts of 0.1% growth. That\u2019s the third quarter of growth in a row, although Italy\u2019s economy was only 0.6% larger than a year ago. ISTAT says: The quarter on quarter change is the result of an increase of value added in agriculture, forestry and fishing, in that of industry and in services. From the demand side, there is a negative contribution by the domestic component (gross of change in inventories) and a positive one by the net export component. Last month, revised data showed that Italy had actually achieved the best recovery of any major European economy over the last four years. Carsten Brzeski, ING\u2019s global head of macro, has welcomed Germany\u2019s GDP report \u2013 saying it proves that its economy can still grow. Brzeski says: Just as some German children have been asking their parents whether they remember a time when the economy was actually growing, the first estimate of 1Q GDP growth came in at 0.2% quarter-on-quarter, from a downwardly revised -0.5% QoQ in the fourth quarter. On the year, the German economy was still down by 0.2% when corrected for working days. There are no estimates for the GDP components but judging by the available monthly data, growth in the first quarter was mainly driven by the construction sector and net exports. Brzeski is also confident that Germany\u2019s economic cycle has started to turn for the better, after some tough quarters. He says: The words \u2018optimism\u2019 and \u2018German economy\u2019 together in one sentence have been a rarity for a long while. However, for a few weeks now, optimism has returned to the German economy. Today\u2019s GDP growth data is almost just the natural next step of stronger sentiment indicators and a pick-up in activity since the start of the year. Here comes the big one, Germany\u2019s GDP report\u2026 And Europe\u2019s largest economy has returned to growth! German GDP expanded by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2024, the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) reports, beating expectations of 0.1% growth. Destatis says this \u201cmodest growth\u201d was due to an increase in gross fixed capital formation in construction and in exports, while household consumption fell. This follows a deeper-than-first-thought contraction at the end of laast year. Destasis reports that Germany shrank by 0.5% in Q4 2023, worst than the 0.3% previously estimated. The number of people out of work in Germany rose more than expected in April, Reuters reports. Federal Labour Office figures this morning show that the number of unemployed grew by 10,000 in seasonally adjusted terms. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected that figure to rise by 9,000. The Czech Republic grew faster than forecast in the first quarter of this year \u2013 continuing the theme of the morning! Czech GDP rose by 0.5% in January-March, beating forecasts of 0.4% growth. Growth was driven by domestic demand, including higher spending by households and investment by businesses. Vladim\u00edr Kermiet, Director of the National Accounts Department of the Czech Statistical Office (CZSO), says: The total final consumption expenditure and an increasing external trade balance contributed to the year-on-year growth. Conversely, a decrease in gross capital formation continued. As the Czech Republic isn\u2019t in the eurozone, this won\u2019t help euro area GDP (due at 10am UK time), but it\u2019s another sign that the European economy is growing this year. On an annual basis, the Czech economy was 0.4% larger than a year ago. Austria\u2019s growth figures are also stronger than expected. Austrian GDP expanded by 0.2% in the first quarter of this year, better than the 0.1% which economists forecast. This is the first increase in GDP in a year, after the economy shrank by 1.3% in the second quarter of 2023, by 0.3% in Q3 2023, and then stagnated in Q4 last year. Growth was driven by private consumer demand, while Austria\u2019s industrial economy remained weak and |\u201dalmost stagnated\u201d, think tank WIFO reports, while investment demand declined again. Separately, inflation in Austria has fallen to an average of 3.5% in April, its lowest level since September 2021. Just in: Spain\u2019s economy has grown faster than forecast. Spanish GDP rose by 0.7% in the first quarter of this year, new data from statistics body INS showed. That\u2019s rather faster than the 0.4% growth which economists had expected \u2013 an encouraging sign, especially after France grew faster than forecast (see earlier post). INS also revised up Spain\u2019s growth in Q4 2023, to 0.7% from 0.6%. On an annual basis, Spain\u2019s economy grew by 2.4%, mostly driven by \u201cnational demand\u201d, with \u201cexternal demand\u201d contributing 0.2 points. This stronger-than-forecast growth should cheer Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who yesterday announced he would stay on as PM despite a \u201charassment and bullying operation\u201d being waged against him and his wife by his political and media enemies. German carmaker Volkswagen has revealed that its operating profits slumped by a fifth in the first quarter of this year. Europe\u2019s top automaker was hit by lower sales and higher costs, but is sticking to its revenue and margin targets for 2024. Arno Antlitz, Volkswagen\u2019s CFO and COO, says the results \u201cshow a slow start to the year\u201d, but he insists that new models will help the company this year: A strong March, the solid order bank and the improving order intake in the past months are encouraging and should already have a positive impact in the second quarter. We expect additional momentum over the course of the year from the launch of more than 30 new models across all brands. Volkswagen\u2019s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) dropped by 20% to \u20ac4.6bn, while sales were down 2%. French inflation has slowed, despite a pick-up in energy prices. France\u2019s consumer price index rose by 2.2% per year in April, statistics body INSEE estimates, down from 2.3% in March. The decrease was partly due to a slowdown in the price rises of food (1.2%) and tobacco (9%), and also to a slight drop (-0.1%) in the cost of manufactured goods. However, energy inflation rose to 3.8% from 3.4% in March, while services inflation stuck at 3%. France\u2019s economy minister has hailed today\u2019s news that the French economy grew more than expected in the first quarter. Bruno Le Maire declared that the government\u2019s strategy was working, after GDP rose by 0.2% in January-March. Le Maire says: \u201cTo all those who want us to believe that our economy is at a standstill: facts are stubborn. French growth is progressing. \u201cThis is a new sign showing the solidity of our economy,\u2026[the] government\u2019s strategy is paying off.\u201d This is the second piece of good news to drop into Le Maire\u2019s inbox in a week. Two major credit-rating agencies, Moody\u2019s and Fitch, left France\u2019s rating unchanged last Friday, despite concerns about its large national debt and deteriorating public finances. Hungary has returned to growth, in an encouraging sign for Eastern Europe\u2019s economy. Hungary\u2019s gross domestic product grew by 0.8% in the first quarter of this year, new data shows, having previously stagnated with 0% growth in the last quarter of 2023. Growth was driven by market services, such as real estate activities as well as information and communication, while the industrial sector shrank. Hotel firm Whitbread, which operates in the UK and Germany, is axing 1,500 jobs in a cost-cutting plan\u2026. and boosting returns to shareholders. Whitbread has today announced a new efficiency programme which will deliver \u00a3150m of cost savings over the next three years. It says: The plan we are announcing today will result in the reduction of around 1,500 roles out of a total UK workforce of 37,000. While these plans are still subject to consultation, we will seek to find alternative opportunities wherever possible through the roles created by this plan and our existing recruitment process that makes c.15,000 hires each year. We expect to retain a significant proportion of those affected who wish to remain with us and we will be providing dedicated support to our teams. Whitbread announced the plan alongside its latest financial results, which show revenues rose 13% in the last financial year, while pre-tax profits grew 21%. Its Premier Inn Germany division grew its sales by 62%, while its losses narrowed to \u00a336m from \u00a350m. Whitbread investors can look forward to higher returns; the company\u2019s board is recommending a 26% increase in the final dividend to 62.9p per share. It also plans to start a new \u00a3150m share buy-back (exactly the amount it intends to save through cost-cutting!), to run through the first half of this financial year. We haev encouraging economic news from Germany too, where consumer spending has risen faster than expected. German retail sales grew by 1.8% in March, beating forecasts of 1.1% growth, and largely reversing the 1.9% drop recorded in February. The broader picture is that France\u2019s economy has only grown modestly over the last nine months. The 0.2% rise in GDP in January-March reported this morning follows two quarters of 0.1% growth. Newsflash: France\u2019s economic growth has accelerated in the first quarter of this year, beating expectations. In an encouraging start to eurozone GDP day, French GDP expanded by 0.2% in January-March, a pick-up on the 0.1% growth recorded in October-December. Economists had only expected growth of 0.1%, so this may bolster hopes that the eurozone has returned to growth. Household spending helped drive the French economy, statistics body INSEE says, with final domestic demand bouncing back and contributing 0.4 percentage points to growth. But foreign trade\u2019s contribution to GDP growth fell to zero, with imports rising by 0.2% and exports up by 0.5%. There\u2019s big news in the banking sector this morning: HSBC\u2019s chief executive officer Noel Quinn is unexpectedly stepping down after nearly 5 years in the job. The board has begun a formal process to find a successor, firing the starting gun to find a replacement at Europe\u2019s largest bank. Quinn is stepping back after leading a series of strategic reviews, boosting HSBC\u2019s investment in its Asian business while cutting back on other markets such as France and the US. Looking ahead, Quinn explains why he\u2019s stepping down: \u201cAfter an intense five years, it is now the right time for me to get a better balance between my personal and business life. I intend to pursue a portfolio career going forward.\u201d Quinn was appointed CEO in March 2020, after a stint as interim chief executive, and steered the bank through the Covid-19 pandemic. He also faced pressure from major shareholder Ping An to separate out its Asian business. There\u2019s good news for UK shoppers this morning \u2013 prices are rising at their slowest rate since late 2021 this month, with non-food goods actually cheaper than a year ago. Deep discounts by clothing and footwear retailers put the brakes on inflation, the latest snapshot of high street spending trends has shown. The monthly bulletin from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) \u2013 the lobby group for the industry \u2013 found that the battle by store owners to offload summer stock in cold and wet weather meant prices in non-food stores were lower this month than a year earlier. The BRC said the cost of non-food goods fell at an annual rate of 0.6% in April, while the price of food increased by 3.4%, down from 3.7% in March. Taken together, food and non-food inflation stood at 0.8% in April, compared to 1.3% in the year to March \u2013 the lowest level since December 2021. More here: We already have some idea how the eurozone fared in the first quarter of this year, as Ireland and Belgium both released growth data yesterday. Ireland\u2019s GDP rose by an impressive-sounding 1.1%. in January-March, led by a rebound in its tech sector. That means Ireland\u2019s technical recession has ended, after its GDP shrank through 2023, including a 3.4% contraction in October-December 2023. GDP isn\u2019t a great way of measuring Ireland\u2019s economy, though, as the data is distorted by multinational companies based in the Republic. Belgium\u2019s data was altogether calmer \u2013 its GDP expanded by 0.3% in January-March, for the fourth quarter in a row. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The eurozone economy is in the spotlight today with new growth figures, and inflation data, being released across the single currency bloc. Having been held back by high interest rates, and the cost of living squeeze, economists are hoping the eurozone returned to growth in the first quarter of this year. Analysts predict that eurozone GDP grew by 0.1% in January-March quarter. That would pull the region out of a shallow recession, after it contracted by 0.1% in the third and fourth quarters of last year. Analysts at Investec are hopeful that we\u2019ll see some growth in the eurozone: Focus will also be on the inflation outlook in the Eurozone, with flash HICP for April due on Tuesday. This will be released at the same time as Q1 GDP. Recent revisions now mean that the Eurozone was in a technical recession in H2, albeit by the slimmest of margins. Given that economic data at the start of 2024 has been more positive, we expect the Eurozone exited that recession in Q1, with a 0.1% quarterly expansion in output. Inflation is expected to remain unchanged at 2.4% in April, while core inflation could slip to 2.6% from 2.9%. Easing inflationary pressures could leave the European Central Bank free to start cutting interest rates in June \u2013 especially if growth were to disappoint\u2026 Also coming up today Frankly, it could be a monster day for news. For starters, new post-Brexit charges on imports of EU food and plant products into Britain begin today. Fees of up to \u00a3145 will apply to small imports of animal products and plants, such as sausages, cheese and yoghurt, entering the UK from the EU through the port of Dover and through Eurotunnel at Folkestone. A flurry of big name companies are reporting financial results today; we\u2019ll hear from Whitbread, Glencore, Prudential, St James\u2019s Place and Howdens, while HSBC has just reported a small (1.5%) dip in profits for the last quarter, to $12.7bn. Over in Europe, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Adidas and Lufthansa are reporting, while on Wall Street McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Amazon will update the markets. Mining giant Anglo American is holding its annual general meeting, days after fending off a takeover proposal from rival BHP Group, who are now considering whether to improve their offer\u2026 And in parliament, MPs on the Treasury committee are holding an inquiry into financial sanctions on Russia this morning, while the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee will question supermarket bosses about food price inflation, profits and relationships with producers this afternoon.

            "title": "UK takes another step on path out of recession as GDP rises ",
            "date": "2024-04-12T06:09:22Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy has taken a step closer to exiting recession as official figures showed growth continued in February despite a washout month for construction and retail after one of the wettest starts to a year on record. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.1% in February, matching City economists\u2019 forecasts and extending a recovery after growth in January was revised up from 0.2% to 0.3%. Liz McKeown, an ONS director of economics statistics, said: \u201cThe economy grew slightly in February with widespread growth across manufacturing, particularly in the car sector. Services also grew a little, with public transport and haulage and telecommunications having strong months. \u201cPartially offsetting this there were notable falls across construction as the wet weather hampered many building projects.\u201d The UK met the technical definition of recession after contracting in the third and fourth quarters of last year. An end to the slump will require a continued expansion in March to meet a quarterly return to growth. Rishi Sunak is under pressure to show progress on the economy before sending voters to the polls in a general election expected later this year, with the Conservatives trailing Labour in opinion polls. The latest figures also show growth of 0.1% over the three months to the end of February, the first expansion over a three-month period since last summer, with activity recovering from a slump last year as households cut back on spending amid the cost of living crisis. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the figures were a \u201cwelcome sign that the economy is turning a corner, and we can build on this progress if we stick to our plan\u201d. Growth in February was driven by manufacturing in particular, with a sharp recovery in car production, where output was up by 17.8% compared with the same month a year earlier. However, construction output collapsed by 1.9% on the month as heavy rainfall forced cranes to sit idle on building sites. The UK\u2019s dominant services sector, which makes up about four-fifths of the economy, also struggled for growth momentum, with an expansion of only 0.1% on the month amid weaker activity in retail and wholesale distribution. The ONS highlighted figures showing it was the fourth wettest February on record in England, contributing to fewer sales by household goods and food stores but increased online sales. It also said conflict in the Middle East had disrupted global supply chains, hitting retailers, vehicle mechanics and health and social work, where approximately one in 10 businesses were affected. Economists said GDP would need to fall by an unlikely 1% or more in March for the economy to contract over the first quarter of 2024 as a whole, meaning an escape from a short and shallow recession is widely anticipated. Business surveys have also pointed to continued strength in private sector activity in March. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cAs a result, we can safely say, after lasting just two quarters and involving a total fall in GDP of just 0.4% or so, [that] the recession ended in the fourth quarter.\u201d However, growth is expected to remain weak while households and businesses remain under pressure from elevated Bank of England interest rates and significantly higher prices for goods and services than three years ago. Despite the monthly recovery in output at the start of 2024, GDP remains below its level of June 2023, and has stayed broadly flat since early 2022. Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: \u201cOur economy is still smaller than this time last year, with growth stuck in the slow lane. Real wages are still worth less than in 2008. And millions are struggling to cover their bills. \u201cAfter 14 years of stagnation you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find many people who feel better off.\u201d The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: \u201cAfter 14 years of Conservative economic failure, Britain is worse off with low growth and high taxes. The Conservatives cannot fix the economy because they are the reason it is broken.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-29T15:38:33Z",
            "content": "PS: The London stock market has ended the day at a new closing high, just. The FTSE 100 index has closed for the night up 7 points, or 0.1%, at 8147 points. That\u2019s its latest in a series of closing highs. Earlier in the session it nudged a new intraday high of 8189.14 points. Time to wrap up\u2026 here\u2019s today\u2019s main stories: Newsflash: Online grocery firm Ocado has been given a bloody nose by shareholders protest over its plan to give its CEO Tim Steiner a potential bonus of almost \u00a315m. But while one in five shareholders opposed the plan, it has been approved. At today\u2019s annual general meeting, 19.4% of shareholders opposed the approval of the Directors\u2019 Remuneration Policy. Another resolution, to approve the Ocado Performance Share Plan 2024, was passed with 80.62% votes in favour, and 19.38% against. As we reported this morning, shareholder advisory group Glass Lewis had urged investors to vote against Ocado\u2019s remuneration policy and performance share plan, citing \u201cegregious remuneration practices\u201d. Campaign group ShareAction planned to ask Ocado\u2019s board why it was comfortable proposing the multimillion-pound pay package for Steiner while \u201crefusing to pay hundreds of its workers a real living wage of \u00a312 an hour\u201d. Under Ocado\u2019s pay plan, Steiner could receive a bonus worth up to 1,800% \u2013 or an \u201cenhanced multiplier\u201d \u2013 of his \u00a3824,570 base salary if its share price hits \u00a329.69 in three years\u2019 time and other performance targets are met. Ocado shares hit \u00a329 during the pandemic when online shopping surged, but have since fallen, trading at 357p today. He would receive an award worth 600% of his base salary, or almost \u00a35m, if targets for total shareholder returns and other performance measures are met but the share price goal is missed. In the mining sector, BHP Group and Vale are proposing a $25.7bn settlement over Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disaster, the Mariana dam failure. The collapse of the Fund\u00e3o tailings dam in November 2015 killed 19 people, polluted a river and devastated livelihoods downstream of the Samarco Mariana Mining Complex. The dam was co-owned by Vale and BHP, through their Brazilian joint venture Samarco; they have been negotiating with the Brazilian State and Federal Government and other public entities. Today, they say: As part of the settlement negotiations, BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale have submitted a non-binding, indicative settlement proposal which is within BHP Brasil\u2019s provision for the Samarco dam failure. The proposal is for a total financial value of approximately R$127 billion (approximately US$25.7 billion) on a 100% basis with Samarco as the primary obligor and a 50% contribution from each of Vale and BHP Brasil as secondary obligors if Samarco cannot fund. The new offer includes around R$37bn (US$7.7bn) already spent on remediation and compensation to date. Shares in Tesla have surged 12% at the start of trading in New York, recovering some of their recent losses. Investors appear to be pleased with Elon Musk\u2019s weekend work in Beijing, where he secured a deal for Tesla to use mapping data provided by web search company Baidu. That deal could be an important step towards Tesla introducing driver assistance technology in the world\u2019s largest car market. My colleague Jasper Jolly explains: Baidu, which dominates web search in China, will provide mapping and navigation functions to help Tesla operate its driver assistance technology, which it calls \u201cfull self-driving\u201d, or FSD, according to sources cited by Bloomberg News. Mapping services \u2013 crucial to driver assistance technologies \u2013 are strictly controlled by China\u2019s government. Despite its name, FSD does not provide autonomous driving abilities: it requires a driver who has \u201chands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment\u201d. However, launching it in China could help Tesla in the fierce competition for market share in the country, and provide more income. It costs $8,000, or $99 (\u00a380) a month, although it is not available in many countries. As covered earlier (8.06am), Musk also met with China\u2019s premier, Li Qiang, during an unexpected trip to the Chinese capital. Tesla\u2019s shares are still down 25% so far this year, but have been recovering since mid-April when they sunk to around $140 each, amid concerns over slowing sales. Kristalina Georgieva then warns that Europe is facing two problems \u2013 low growth and high debt. She explains: Problem one: growth. Our World Economic Outlook shows the global economy converging back to a rather weak trend rate of growth. Yes, the US economy still looks like it\u2019s firing on all cylinders, but that is unlikely to last. In China, real-estate issues weigh on the outlook. In Europe, productivity growth lags behind, reflecting much less private investment in new technologies than in the United States. This is why we say it is vital to pursue structural reforms and scale-up innovation and investment. Europe needs faster productivity growth, and that means reforms\u2014including transformational ones in the energy and digital arenas, and the completion of the single market. Problem two: debt. After two massive shocks\u2014the pandemic and the energy-supply shock caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u2014many countries are shouldering very heavy public debt burdens. This is why we say many countries must now pursue judicious, wellarticulated medium-term fiscal consolidation to rebuild buffers\u2014 appropriately tailored to country specifics, of course. This is \u201cnot a great place\u201d to start a big push to develop clean energy supply and fight climate change, Georgieva cautions, adding: But let us be clear: if we do not win the fight against climate change, all of humanity together, we will all suffer. Over in Brussels, the head of the International Monetary Fund has welcomed signs that inflation is easing in the eurozone. Kristalina Georgieva, IMF managing director, is addressing the Annual EU Budget Conference, and begins by hailing easing inflation. Georgieva says: The global environment. When we stare out at the horizon, what do we see? I see a hint of sunshine. But I also see a dull grey sky and some dark clouds. Let me start with the sunshine. After a global burst of inflation to levels many people have never seen in their lifetimes, it looks like the ECB\u2019s tight monetary policy is doing its work. This is something I need to say carefully because it\u2019s not over yet. But, yes, it looks promising: inflation down from its disturbingly high peaks and no deep recessions in Europe. Georgieva then warns, though, that the forget though, that \u201cthe last mile can be the hardest\u201d in the fight against inflation. No longer will the major central banks be marching in lockstep, as they did during the recent ratehiking cycle. No. From now on, each currency zone will have to chart its own path. An interest rate divergence looms, and maybe some exchange rate movements too. We save the champagne for later. Over at Heathrow Airport, members of Border Force have set up a picket line as a four-day strike in a dispute over working conditions. The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union said more than 300 of its members will take part in the industrial action, which started at 5am today and will continue until 7am on Friday. The union said the workers, based at Heathrow\u2019s Terminals 2, 3, 4 and 5, are protesting at plans to introduce new rosters they claim will see around 250 of them forced out of their jobs at passport control. PCS general secretary Fran Heathcote said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that, despite talks last week, the Home Office is not prepared to grant any flexibility to their new roster. \u201cNone of our dedicated and highly experienced members in the Border Force want to take strike action but the way they\u2019ve been treated by their employer leaves them with no option. \u201cThe Home Office still have time to prevent tomorrow\u2019s strike if they agree to abandon this unworkable new system.\u201d Just in: German inflation rise slightly this month. On an EU-harmonised basis, German consumer price inflation rose to 2.4% this month, up from 2.3% in March. On a non-harmonised basis, though, German inflation was flat at 2.2%, with services inflation slowing to 3.4% but goods inflation rising to 1.2%. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy, eased to 3% in April from 3.3% in March. Inflation in Spain has risen, as Madrid\u2019s government cut back support for energy bills. Spanish consumer price inflation rose to 3.3% per year in April, up from 3.2% in March. Inflation was pushed up by gas prices \u2013 which rose this month but fell in April 2023 \u2013 after Spain\u2019s government stopped measures taken to ease rising inflation after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Food prices also rose. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy prices, fell to 2.9% from 3.3% in March. This data, and Germany\u2019s CPI report due in half an hour, will feed into the latest eurozone inflation data due at 10am tomorrow. Ireland\u2019s return to growth is a sign that tomorrow\u2019s eagerly-awaited eurozone GDP report may bring good news. Economists predict the eurozone returned to modest growth in Q1 2024, after shrinking slightly in the second half of last year (GDP fell by 0.1% in both Q3 and Q4 2023). Ireland\u2019s 1.1% growth, and the 0.3% recorded in Belgium this morning, will help that return to growth. Analysts at Investec said last Friday: Recent revisions now mean that the Eurozone was in a technical recession in H2, albeit by the slimmest of margins. Given that economic data at the start of 2024 has been more positive, we expect the Eurozone exited that recession in Q1, with a 0.1% quarterly expansion in output. Newsflash: Ireland has escaped a technical recession, after its economy returned to growth this year driven by its IT sector. Ireland\u2019s GDP is estimated to have risen by 1.1% quarter-on-quarter in January-March, new data from the Central Statistics Office shows. Growth was driven mainly by an increase in the Information &amp; Communication sector. That follows a 3.4% tumble in GDP in the final three months of 2023. Enda Behan, statistician in the National Accounts Data Collection and Quality Division, said: \u201cIn today\u2019s release, GDP is estimated to have expanded by 1.1% in Q1 2024 in volume terms when compared with Q4 2023. This was driven by an increase in the multinational dominated sector of Information &amp; Communication in Q1 2024. GDP is estimated to have fallen by 0.8% when compared with the same quarter of 2023. Ireland\u2019s GDP fell in every quarter of last year, shrinking by 3.4% in Q1, 0.1% in Q2 and 2.5% in Q3. But\u2026.GDP is not a very precise way of measuring the Irish economy, as it is dominated by multinational companies based in the Republic. Ireland\u2019s government favours another measures, called modified domestic demand, which excludes the large transactions of foreign corporations. Unfortunately we did not have new MDD data today. Just in: economic sentiment has fallen marginally in the EU and the euro area, as Europeans fret about their employment prospects. The Economic Sentiment Indicator declined in the EU (by 0.3 points to 96.2) in April, and by more within the eurozone (where it fell by 0.6 points to 95.6). The employment expectations gauge fell slightly more sharply. Confidence among industrial firms, and among services companies, both fell; consumer confidence inched up, but remained in negative territory. Within individual countries, economic sentiment deteriorated significantly in France (-4.8 points) and more moderately in Italy (-1.3 points), while it improved markedly in Spain (+2.3), Germany (+1.5) and Poland (+1.5). The ESI remained broadly stable in the Netherlands (rising by 0.3). Tomorrow we learn whether the eurozone returned to growth, when GDP data for the first quarter of 2024 is released\u2026. Belgium\u2019s economy has continued to grow at a modest pace, new data from its central bank shows. Belgian GDP rose by 0.3% in January-March, the fourth quarter in a row in which a 0.3% expansion was recorded. Both industry and services grew by 0.3%, while the construction sector shrank by 0.2%. Sweden\u2019s economy has shrunk for the fourth quarter in a row, leaving it in recession. Swedish GDP shrank by 0.1% in the first quarter of 2024, Statistics Sweden reported this morning. Mattias Kain Wyatt, economist at Statistics Sweden, says: \u201cSwedish economic activity continued to weaken in the first quarter of 2024 with contractions in the months of February and March. This is the fourth consecutive quarter with negative growth.\u201d Marc Ostwald, chief economist &amp; global strategist at ADM Investor Service, says the data is much weaker than expected. Sweden\u2019s economy is in a poor run; GDP contracted by 0.8% in April-June 2023, then by 0.3% in July-September 2023, followed by a 0.1% contraction in October-December. New inflation data today has shown that prices rose in four German states this month. In Bavaria, the annual inflation rate rose in April to 2.5% from 2.3% in March, in Brandenburg it rose to 3.0% from 2.8%, in Saxony it rose to 2.7% from 2.5%, and in Hesse it rose to 1.9% from 1.6%. Inflation didn\u2019t rise everwhere, though; it was flat at 2.3% in North Rhine-Westphalia, and fell to 2.1% from 2.3% in Baden-Wuerttemberg. This tees up Germany\u2019s inflation report, due at 1pm today, which is expected to show a rise to 2.3% from 2.2% in March. Shares in Dutch medical device maker Philips have surged by a third this morning, after it settled a legal case in the US over its breathing devices, for less than feared. Philips has agreed to pay $1.1bn to settle all personal injury claims filed in the US over its sleep apnea machines. The devices were recalled in 2021, over concerns that they used foam which could degrade and become toxic, carrying potential cancer risks. Lawsuits (see here) have claimed that people who used these devices had developed cancer, lung problems or other injuries due to degraded foam. Uncertainty over the case had slashed Philips\u2019 market value in the past three years, with forecasts that it could cost around $4bn in a worst-case scenario. CEO Roy Jakobs told reporters today: \u201c$1.1 billion is a significant amount, however you put it. This is important to end uncertainty and to provide clarity on our way forward.\u201d The London stock market has begun the new week on the front foot, jumping to a new alltime high. The FTSE 100 share index jumped by 45 points, or over 0.5%, to a new intraday high of 8185 points. Prudential are among the top riser, up 3%, after fellow Asia-Pacific insurer AIA Group reported strong results. UK retailers Frasers are up 3.1% after announcing a new share buyback programme this morning, while Anglo American are also among the risers on speculation that BHP may make a higher bid. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u2018\u2019Sentiment is upbeat at the start of the week, fuelled by relief that inflationary pressures in the US aren\u2019t as bad as feared, and hopes return that a ceasefire could be negotiated in the Middle East. The FTSE 100 has scaled fresh heights, with another sprint higher in early trade. April has been a record-breaking month for the blue-chip index, with a glass-half full sentiment dominating. The Footsie has gained more than 11% over the last six months, with super-patient investors finally rewarded by this spurt of growth. The weaker pound against the dollar has been a key player in the power surge, with the greenback gaining ground against a basket of currencies on the latest interest rate expectations. Investor optimism has been buoyed by a rally on US markets on Friday, and developments in the Middle East. Negotiators from Israel and Hamas expected to meet in Egypt, while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken ups diplomatic efforts at the World Economic Forum in Riyadh, Saudia Arabia. There\u2019s drama in the foreign exchange market today, with Japan\u2019s yen fluctuating wildly. The yen hit a new 34-year low, trading at 160 yen to the dollar for the first time since 1990. But it then rebounded, back to 155 yen/$, stronger than Friday night\u2019s 157 yen/$. The strength of this recovery has sparked speculation that Toyko may have intervened to support the yen. The yen weakened last Friday after the Bank of Japan kept interest rates on hold, and didn\u2019t provide any sign that it might lift borrowing costs to support the yen. Robin Brooks, senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, points out that the BoJ is also committed to capping the yield (or interest rate) on government bonds; that makes it harder to take action to support the yen: In the City, shares in miner Anglo American have jumped 2.5% at the start of trading, as traders anticipate further takeover drama. Last Friday, Anglo rejected a \u00a331.1bn approach from larger rival BHP Group, saying it significantly undervalued the miner and its prospects. Since then, a source has told Reuters that BHP is considering making an improved bid, which could be made in the coming weeks. Anglo\u2019s shares have risen to \u00a327 this morning, for the first time in just over a year, further above BHP\u2019s initial offer of \u00a325.08 per share. Elon Musk appears to be flying back from China after a busy, if unexpected, trip to Beijing on Sunday. A plane linked to Musk has taken off from Beijing, Reuters reported at 6.22am UK time today. During his trip, Musk held talks with the country\u2019s premier, Li Qiang, and posted: Honored to meet with Premier Li Qiang. \u201cWe have known each other now for many years, since early Shanghai days. Over the weekend, Tesla reached a deal with Chinese search giant Baidu for its mapping and navigation functions, which could help the electric car company gain approval for its driver-assistance technology in China. In another breakthrough, local Chinese authorities removed restrictions on Tesla cars after the company\u2019s China-made vehicles passed the country\u2019s data security requirements. Previously, Teslas had been banned from some government-related properties due to concerns about what data was being collected. Tesla\u2019s vehicles were not the only ones that passed the data security rules, CNBC points out, adding: In addition to Tesla\u2019s Model 3 and Model Y, several new energy vehicles from BYD, Lotus, Nezha, Li Auto and Nio passed China\u2019s data security requirements, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers and the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China said Sunday. Prices for smaller homes such as flats have been increasing at a faster rate than bigger properties amid affordability constraints, according to lender Halifax this morning. Halifax reports that the \u201crace for space\u201d that was seen during the coronavirus pandemic has now gone into reverse, with buyers targeting smaller, cheaper homes. In the year to February, the average price of a flat increased by 2.7%, while the average terraced property value rose by 2.6%, Halifax said. Prices for semi-detached and detached homes increased at lower rates, rising by 1.7% and 2.0% respectively. Amanda Bryden, head of Halifax Mortgages, said: \u201cAs interest rates have stabilised and buyers adjust to the new economic reality of owning a home, one way to compensate for higher borrowing costs is to target smaller properties. \u201cThis is especially true among first-time buyers, who have proven to be resilient over recent years, and now account for the largest proportion of homes purchased with a mortgage in almost 30 years. \u201cWe see this reflected in property prices for the first few months of this year, with the value of flats rising most sharply, closing the \u2018growth gap\u2019 on bigger properties that\u2019s existed for most of the last four years.\u201d Zoopla\u2019s calculations showing a rise in mortgage costs come at a time when several mortgage lenders are increasing rates, blaming \u201cmarket uncertainty\u201d. The City currently expect just two interest rate cuts this year, less than they expected at the start of 2024, with the first cut fully priced in for September. Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at estate agents Knight Frank, says \u201cHousing market activity has rebounded over the last year but the shock of the mini-Budget was still reverberating during the early months of 2023. The pipeline of sales has grown since Christmas, largely as positivity from January translates into spring listings. Since then, the prospect of the first rate cut since March 2020 has become more remote with each release of economic data, which means mortgage rates have edged back up and house prices are once again under downwards pressure.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. A year and a half on from the mini-budget turmoil, UK households are still paying sharply more when they take out a mortgage. New research from property website Zoopla this morning shows that higher mortgage rates are adding to the affordability pressures on buyers, and dragging on house price inflation. Zoopla has calculated that the average home buyer taking out a 70% loan to value mortgage now face annual mortgage repayments that are 61% higher today than three years ago (in March 2021) before mortgage rates started to rise. That\u2019s because mortgage rates are around 4.5% today compared to below 2% in March 2021, meaning average annual mortgage repayments have risen from \u00a37,100 to \u00a311,400. However, only two-thirds of this increase is driven by higher mortgage rates, with a third down to the fact that house prices are 13% higher than 3 years ago, Zoopla adds. Londoners (where property prices are highest), face the largest increase, of \u00a37,500 per year. Buyers in the South West, South East and East of England face paying at least \u00a35,000 per year more. Across other regions and countries of the UK, the increase is lower, at between \u00a32,350 and \u00a33,900 a year. Mortgage rates had been rising in 2022 as the Bank of England lifted interest rates, and the City anticipated further tightening. But costs then jumped after the unfunded tax cuts in the mini-budget of September 2022 alarmed investors, prompting a selloff in government bonds used to price fixed mortgages. Liz Truss, though, last week declined to apologise for the sharp rise in interest rates during her time in office, pointing out that mortgage rates have gone up across the world. But, UK government bond yields (which rise when prices fall) certainly did spike through September 2022: Zoopla\u2019s data also shows that house sales volumes are up 12% year on year, in the four weeks to 21 April, putting the market on track for 1.1m sales in 2024, up 10% on last year But prices dipped by 0.2% month-on-month, while almost two thirds (64%) of all homes are in local markets where prices are lower than a year ago. Factors including higher mortgage rates and stamp duty are behind ongoing price falls across the south of England, Zoopla reckons. Richard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla, says the market is adjusting to higher borrowing costs; he doesn\u2019t believe prices will start to rise as buyers face much higher mortgage repayments than in the recent past, so sellers should remain realistic. \u201cThe rebound in sales being agreed continues for a fourth month as mortgage rates have fallen, consumer confidence improves and home buyers have much greater choice of homes for sale. The pipeline of sales is growing and we expect 100,000 more people to move home in 2024 than last year. Also coming up today Ocado faces a showdown with shareholders at its annual meeting today, over a new pay scheme that could hand boss Tim Steiner a bonus share award of up to \u00a315m. While in Whitehall, senior officials are worried that Thames Water\u2019s financial collapse could trigger a rise in government borrowing costs not seen since the chaos of the mini-budget. Officials in the Treasury and the UK\u2019s Debt Management Office fear that, unless the UK\u2019s biggest water company is renationalised as soon as possible, \u201cprolonged uncertainty\u201d about its fate could \u201cdamage confidence in UK plc at a sensitive time\u201d\u2026.

            "content": "The FTSE 100 benefited from anxiety over the Middle East today, as well as relief that the UK economy is growing, reports Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown \u201cThe FTSE has been lifted higher by the fresh breeze in the sails of the UK economy. It\u2019s still on a very slow course of growth but, with slender green shoots appearing, it\u2019s benefiting stocks reliant on the financial health of consumers and companies. With growth not shooting the lights out, and inflationary pressures easing, there is still plenty of optimism around about the prospect of interest rate cuts coming in the summer, which has given the FTSE 100 an extra surge of power. Gold\u2019s safe-haven credentials glimmered even brighter amid concerns about an escalation of conflict in the Middle East, while Brent Crude jumped by more than 2% to hover around $92 a barrel. Investors appeared rattled in early afternoon trade over warnings about an imminent attack by Iran on Israel, but the index gained back ground to edge to a record high at the close. The FTSE 100 has clearly regained its mojo as the defensive nature of the index comes to the fore. A large handful of FTSE 100 listed companies, which breached record levels earlier in the month, have been climbing back close to those highs, including Rolls Royce and BAE Systems. Aerospace stocks have been pushed higher by heightened geo-political tensions and post-pandemic demand. With violence having widened in the Middle East, and Ukraine appealing for more weapons to repel Russia, there is an expectation that military budgets will keep expanding. This has been reinforced by defence chiefs in Nordic countries, and the UK, calling for better military preparedness over the next decade.\u201d With hopes of a record FTSE 100 high dashed until at least Monday, it\u2019s time to wrap up. Here\u2019s today\u2019s main stories: Have a lovely weekend; we\u2019ll be back next week. GW The UK\u2019s blue-chip share index has failed to end the day at a new record closing high. The FTSE 100 index has closed for the night at 7995 points, up 71 points or 0.9%. That\u2019s its highest closing high since February 2023, when the index hit its record high of 8,047 points (which we NEARLY hit around lunchtime). Spirits in the City were lifted by the news that the economy continued to grow in February, with GDP up 0.1%. This has cemented hopes that the UK will officially exit recession by growing over the first quarter of 2024, with economic institute NIESR today predicting the recession was in the \u2018rearview miror\u2019. Jason Hollands, managing director of online investment platform Bestinvest, says improving optimism about the domestic economy helped lift stocks. \u201cToday\u2019s confirmation that UK GDP expanded by 0.1% in February, following on from growth of 0.3% in January, will be seen by many as the key reason for the latest market moves as the data signals that the technical recession that the UK entered at the end of last year is almost certainly over. But other, less cheery, factors are also lifting the FTSE 100, Hollands adds: Heightened tensions in the Middle East with the risk of a regional war between Iran and Israel breaking out imminently, have propelled both oil and precious metal prices higher. Among the best performers in the FTSE 100 today are mining and energy stocks. As at midday, Fresnillo \u2013 the world\u2019s second largest gold miner and largest silver producer \u2013 was the best performing FTSE 100 constituent \u2013 rising c5%, followed by major copper producer Antofagasta and Anglo American, the world\u2019s largest platinum producer. Energy is a major sector on the UK market, representing 12.8% of the FTSE 100, and both BP and Shell are on the rise against a backdrop of Brent Crude oil prices exceeding $90 a barrel. Shares in BP gained 3.6% today, after Reuters reported that Abu Dhabi\u2019s state-owned oil company had considered making a bid. Housebuilders were also among the top risers, after JP Morgan lifted its rating on several construction firms. Credit ratings agency Fitch has downgraded Thames Water\u2019s parent company, Kemble, into \u2018restricrive default\u2019, a week after it missed an interest payment. Fitch has announced that it has downgraded Kemble Water Finance Limited\u2019s (the holding company of Thames Water Utilities Limited)) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to \u2018Restricted Default\u2019 (RD) from \u2018C\u2019. Earlier this week Fitch lowered Kemble to C, which is one notch above default, while it waited to see if it made the missed interest payment on \u00a3149.8m. Fitch adds that the rating could yet be lowered further, to D, in the absence of an agreement with lenders and bondholders, leading to bankruptcy filings or other procedures. Oil has hit its highest level since last October tonight, amid fears of further Middle East tensions. Brent crude has hit $92 per barrel for the first time since last October, as Israel braces for the possibility of an attack by Iran, John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, has told reporters that the prospect of an Iranian attack on Israel is \u201cstill a viable threat\u201d.. Unless stocks manage a late rally in London, we won\u2019t get any record highs today after all. The FTSE 100 is still having a strong day, but has slipped back to 7993 points, up 70 points today (+0.9%). That wouldn\u2019t be enough for a closing high. The chair of parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee, Dame Harriett Baldwin, has welcomed Ben Bernanke\u2019s review into the Bank of England: Baldwin adds: We asked the Chair of Court in June last year to commission a review of what had gone wrong with the Bank\u2019s inflation forecasting. We look forward to scrutinising Dr Bernanke\u2019s review when he gives evidence to our Committee in May.\u201d Over in the US, consumer confidence has weakened as people remain anxious about inflation. The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index has dropped this month, to 77.9, down from 79.4 in March. Those surveyed grew more pessimistic about current economic conditions, and a little less optimistic about economic expectations. Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu says: Sentiment moved sideways for the fourth straight month, as consumers perceived few meaningful developments in the economy. Since January, sentiment has remained remarkably steady within a very narrow 2.5 index point range, well under the 5 points necessary for a statistically significant difference in readings. Consumers perceived little change in the state of the economy since the start of the new year. Expectations over personal finances, business conditions, and labor markets have all been stable over the last four months. However, a slight uptick in inflation expectations in April reflects some frustration that the inflation slowdown may have stalled. Overall, consumers are reserving judgment about the economy in light of the upcoming election, which, in the view of many consumers, could have a substantial impact on the trajectory of the economy. Next\u2019s CEO, Lord Simon Wolfson, has been rewarded for the retailer\u2019s good 2023 with a bumper pay rise. Wolfson\u2019s total pay rose to \u00a34.5m for the 2023-24 financial year, up from \u00a32.5m the year before, Next\u2019s annual report shows. It looks to be his best year\u2019s pay since 2016. That included a salary of \u00a3908,000 (up from \u00a3865,000), an annual bonus of \u00a31.3m (up from \u00a3700,000), and long-term incentive plan payouts of \u00a32.07m, up from \u00a3704,000). Chairman Michael Roney says the last financial year was a very good year for Next, which \u201cmaterially outperformed\u201d expectations. Pre-tax profits rose 5% to \u00a3918m. Wall Street has opened in the red. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 229 points, or 0.6%, in early trading to 38,229 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 is also down 0.6%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq is 0.8% lower. The repricing of interest rate cut expectations continues to weigh on shares. But so do some mixed results from US banks; JP Morgan shares are down 3.6%. Over in Germany, inflation has sunk to its lowest level in almost three years. The annual inflation rate in Germany dipped to 2.2% in March 2024, statistics body Destatis reported this morning. That\u2019s down from 2.5% in February 2024, and 2.9% in January 2024, and the lowest reading since May 2021. Having approached the brink of a new alltime high this afternoon, the FTSE 100 has turned tail and headed south. The blue-chip index has now dropped back to 7,999 points, having earlier hit 8,044 \u2013 just three points off the record. Miners and oil companies are rallying, as are UK housebuilders after a positive research note from JP Morgan. But\u2026 the higher oil price is hurting the travel sector, with airlines easyJet (-4.9%) and IAG (-3.1%) leading the FTSE 100 fallers. In the tech world, Apple has lost a bid to throw out UK lawsuit over fees for its App Store A judge ruled today that Apple must face allegations it charged more than 1,500 UK-based developers unfair commission fees on purchases of apps and other content. Sean Ennis, a competition law professor and economist, is spearheading the case, which was filed at London\u2019s Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) last year and alleges Apple charged developers unfair commissions of up to 30%. Ben Bernanke\u2019s report into the Bank of England\u2019s forecasting is measured but still quietly devastating, our economics editor Larry Elliott writes: The Bank of England has got markedly worse at forecasting the economy in recent years. Its economic model is faulty. Its systems are out of date. It has been reluctant to admit past mistakes. Communication with the public could be better. If Threadneedle Street thought it was going to get an easy ride when it called in the former head of the US central bank, Ben Bernanke, to conduct a review of how decisions on interest rates have been made in recent years, it was mistaken. More here: JP Morgan Chase, the largest US bank, has reported better than expected first quarter earnings bolstered by the higher interest rate environment and its acquisition of First Republic, a smaller regional lender, last year. The US bank reported first quarter revenues of $42.55bn, beating analysts expectations of $41.85bn, and earnings per share of $4.44 against forecasts of $4.11 helped by lower provisions for credit losses. First quarter net profit rose 6 % to $13.42bn against $12.62bn in the same period of 2023. Analysts have said that JP Morgan\u2019s strong net interest income figures - broadly the difference between what it pays on deposits and what it earns on loans -were not likely to be sustainable in a lower interest environment as US Federal Reserve starts cutting rates later this year. This week it emerged that US inflation rose by more than expected in March which could force the US Federal Reserve to delay cutting interest rates and the market has priced in fewer cuts to rates than had previously been expected. Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JP Morgan, said earlier this week in his annual letter to shareholders that JP Morgan was ready for a \u201cvery broad range\u201d of interest rates from 2% to 8%. Dimon said on Friday that there seems to be \u201ca large number of persistent inflationary pressures, which may likely continue.\u201d although \u201cmany economic indicators continue to be favorable.\u201c He added: \u201cHowever, looking ahead, we remain alert to a number of significant uncertain forces. First, the global landscape is unsettling \u2013 terrible wars and violence continue to cause suffering, and geopolitical tensions are growing.\u201d Back in the City, the FTSE 100 index is getting pretty close to a new alltime high. The share index is now up 116 points, or 1.5%, at 8040 points \u2013 only a handful away from the record peak of 8,047 set over a year ago\u2026. Ben Bernanke has resisted recommending that the Bank of England adopt the so-called \u201cdot plot\u201d which he introduced at the Federal Reserve when he ran the US central bank. The dot plot outlines where each policymaker thinks interest rates will be over time, to communicate their thinking to the markets. There was speculation that Bernanke could propose they were brought in by the BoE, as part of today\u2019s review of the Bank\u2019s processes. But in the event, he decided that such a change would be \u201chighly consequential\u201d, so this issue should be left to \u201cfuture deliberations\u201d Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, thinks this is \u201ca real shame\u201d. Dales explains: Projecting interest rates would be the clearest way for the Bank to communicate what it thinks is required to hit the 2% inflation target. Ben Bernanke\u2019s review makes 12 recommendations to improve the Bank of England\u2019s forecasting and related processes. Some of them focus on software, including either improving or replacing the BoE\u2019s baseline economic model, known as COMPASS. Others look at ways to improving the bank\u2019s forecasts, and the way they are presented in the monetary policy report (MPR). Here\u2019s the list: The ongoing updating and modernisation of software to manage and manipulate data should be continued with high priority and as rapidly as feasible. Model maintenance and development should be an ongoing priority, supported by a significant increase in dedicated staff time and adequate resources, including specialised software as needed. Over the longer term, the Bank should undertake a thorough review and updating of its forecasting framework, including replacing or, at a minimum, thoroughly revamping COMPASS. Revamp the Bank\u2019s forecasting framework, including a rich representation of the monetary transmission mechanism, empirically based modelling of inflation expectations, models of wage-price determination that allow gradual adjustment and causation from prices to wages as well as from wages to prices, detailed models of key components of the UK economy, and a greater focus on the supply side of the economy. Encourage Bank staff to highlight significant forecast errors and their sources The Bank should review its personnel policies to determine if existing staff could be deployed in ways that improve the forecasting infrastructure and forecast quality. The monetary policy committee\u2019s central forecast should be regularly augmented by alternative scenarios, with the specific scenarios ideally decided upon at an early stage of each forecast round by the MPC and staff. Publish selected alternative scenarios in the MPR, along with the central forecast, to help the public better understand the reasons for the policy choice, including risk management considerations. The MPC should de-emphasise the central forecast based on the market rate path in its communications and be exceptionally clear in warning about situations in which it judges the standard conditioning assumptions to be inconsistent with its view of the outlook. The MPC should also replace or cut back the detailed quantitative discussion of economic conditions in the Monetary Policy Summary in favour of a shorter and more qualitative description, following the practice of most peer central banks. The fan charts published in the MPR should be eliminated Extra resources should be dedicated to implement the changes being recommended Newsflash: An eagerly awaited review of the Bank of England\u2019s forecasting methods, conducted by former top US central banker Ben Bernanke, is out\u2026 and it urges the UK central bank to fix its forecasts and technology. The Bernanke review has been billed as an opportunity for a \u2018once in a generation\u2019 overhaul of the BoE\u2019s forecasting. And it has found that the Bank has used out-of-date methods and failed to communicate clearly with the public. This undermined the BoE\u2019s record of forecasting inflation and the path of interest rates, according to the review. My colleague Phillip Inman reports: In a bruising assessment, the former US Federal Reserve boss Ben Bernanke said the Bank spent much of its time attempting to justify its poor judgment rather than admit its failures and change course. Accusing the Bank of appearing to \u201cat times suffer from excessive incrementalism\u201d, he said policymakers had raised rates too slowly over the past two years when it was clear inflation was already rising beyond normal levels. After an eight-month review, Bernanke says rather damningly that \u201cthe accuracy of the BoE\u2019s forecasts has deteriorated significantly in the past few years\u201d. But he also points out that other central banks have had similar problems. He also advises the BoE should scrap its fan charts, which it uses to show the likelyhood of a range of outcomes, in favour of a more qualitative assessment of risks \u2013 using alternative scenarios to show how the bank might act if economic conditions play out unexpectedly. Bernanke\u2019s review also found that \u201cthe most serious problems\u201d were the deficiencies of the Bank\u2019s forecasting infrastructure. These are the tools the staff uses to produce the quarterly forecast and supporting analyses. \u201cSome key software is out of date and lacks important functionality,\u201d the review says. The UK recession is now in the \u201crearview mirror\u201d, says forecasters at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, who predict GDP will grow by 0.4% in the first quarter of this year. This return to growth would mean that the recession, which began in the second half of last year, would be over. Following this morning\u2019s news that the economy grew by 0.1% in February, and by 0.3% in January, NEISR sees growth continuing. It says: We forecast GDP to grow by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2024. Our early forecast for the second quarter of this year sees GDP growing by 0.3 per cent. While exiting from the shallow recession in the second half of 2023 is welcoming, these forecasts remain broadly consistent with the longer-term trend of low, but stable economic growth in the United Kingdom. The rally on the London stock market today is partly driven by miners, as commodity prices strengthen. In London, the zinc price gained 3% this morning, with copper up 2%, while aluminium hit a two-year high in Shanghai. This has helped lift shares in mining giant Anglo American (+4%), with Chilean copper producer Angofagasta up 4.5%, and Glencore 3.7% higher. The pound has weakened to its lowest level against the US dollar so far this year. Sterling has lost over half a cent this morning, sending it down to $1.249 against the dollar this morning. That\u2019s the lowest since late November last year. It appears to be mainly due to dollar strength, with the US currency benefitting from forecasts that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates more slowly than expected. The euro is also down against the dollar, after the European Central Bank signalled yesterday it could start cutting interest rates in June. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says: The UK economy grew tepidly in February, with GDP expanding by 0.1%. Sterling remains under the cosh. The euro sank to its weakest since mid-November on anticipation of policy divergence. Tina McKenzie, policy chair of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), points out that smaller UK businesses, especially in the retail and hospitality sector, are still struggling, even though the economy has been growing this year: \u201cPositive economic growth in February is certainly welcome, building on January\u2019s momentum and giving a measure of optimism to small firms, who have been battling against strong headwinds for some time now. There are signs of cautious recovery among the small business community \u2013 but it is important to emphasise that this is not evenly distributed between sectors. It will take more than flashes of growth to raise spirits in the hospitality and retail sectors, for example, whose confidence scores were way below the headline figure for all businesses at the end of last year, according to our Small Business Index. Today\u2019s ONS data shows that these sectors continue to struggle. The outlook for the UK economy is \u201cundoubtedly improving\u201d, argues ING\u2019s developed markets economist James Smith: \u201cThe UK\u2019s monthly GDP numbers have been on a wild ride over the past few months. But fresh data shows that the economy grew by 0.1% in February as widely expected. And that followed a decent rebound in activity in January after December was dragged down by a strangely weak Christmas trading period for retailers. Assuming we get another slight pick up in activity during March, we think the UK economy is poised to grow by 0.3% for the first quarter as a whole. That would mark the end of a very modest technical recession, albeit one where the aggregate figures masked steeper falls in per capita output. Share prices in London are rallying (see previous post) on relief that the UK economy continued to grow in February, reports Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. With the FTSE 100 index rising through the 8,000 point mark this morning, he says: \u201cThe second monthly GDP increase in a row for the UK has triggered a ticker tape parade from investors as they become more hopeful the country will come out of recession. \u201cBoth the FTSE 100 and the more domestic-focused FTSE 250 index jumped 0.8% at the market open, indicating investors are happy that the economy is moving forward, albeit at a snail\u2019s pace. Some growth is better than no growth at all. \u201cHousebuilders and supermarkets were in demand as investors took the view that a stronger economy will give a boost to consumer confidence and provide a better backdrop for spending. \u201cMiners also helped to give the FTSE 100 a lift as copper prices continued to climb thanks to the twin engines of supply fears and brighter demand prospects. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 share index has climbed back to 8,000 points, less than 50 points from its alltime high. The blue-chip index has now gained 78 points, or almost 1%, today, to trade at 8,004 points. That puts it nearer its alltime peack of 8,047 points. Markets are recovering after a choppy week, as investors weigh up Wednesday\u2019s high-than-expected US inflation reading which has undermined hopes of early interest rate cuts in America. Precious metals producer Fresnillo is the top riser, up 5%, after the gold price hit a new record high today. UK housbuilders Taylor Wimpey (+4.4%) and Persimmon (+3.5%) are close behind. And BP is still in the top risers (+2.5%), following last night\u2019s reports that the UAE\u2019s state oil company has explored a multibillion pound takeover. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has responded to today\u2019s GDP data, saying: \u201cAfter 14 years of Conservative economic failure, Britain is worse off with low growth and high taxes. The Conservatives cannot fix the economy because they are the reason it is broken. Hailey Low, associate economist at NIESR, agrees that the UK economy seems to be at a turning point\u2026. but also points out that it has effectively flatlined since 2022: Monthly GDP grew by 0.1% in February 2024, with contributions from all major sectors except construction following a revised 0.3% growth in January. In the three months to February, GDP growth was 0.2%, higher than what we forecasted last month. On the back of exiting a shallow recession in 2023, this seems to be a turning point, but in a broader perspective, the UK economy has flatlined since 2022. Increasing productivity will be a constant challenge that requires structural changes and long-term spending commitments to public investment and infrastructure.\u201d Shares have opened higher in London, as City traders digest the news that Britain is escaping recession. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has gained almost 0.9% or 68 points, to trade at 7992 points. Nearly every share on the Footsie is up, helping to move it closer to its alltime high of 8,047 points, hit in February 2023. BP is among the top risers, up 2.6%, after Reuters reported last night that the United Arab Emirates\u2019 state-owned oil company had considered launching a takeover bid for the UK oil giant! Those deliberations \u201cdid not progress beyond preliminary discussions\u201d, though. Although the economy expanded a little in February, it was actually smaller than a year ago! The ONS estimates that GDP fell 0.2% in February compared with the same month last year. Over the longer term, GDP is estimated to have fallen by 0.1% in the three months to February 2024 compared with the three months to February 2023. These chart shows the broader picture \u2013 UK growth has been lacklustre for months. The Institute of Directors don\u2019t share Jeremy Hunt\u2019s cheery take on today\u2019s GDP report. Dr. Roger Barker, Director of Policy at the Institute of Directors, points out that the economy barely grew in February, by expanding just 0.1%. This suggests that the economy is still in a fragile state, Barker warns, adding: After a strong start to the year, the consumer-facing parts of the economy \u2013 particularly accommodation and food services \u2013 took a backward step. Construction was also surprisingly weak, although there were encouraging signs of revival in production and manufacturing output. \u201cIt appears that the UK\u2019s ascent out of the mild technical recession of last year is a relatively shallow one. Although the latest figures suggest that the UK is likely to generate positive economic growth in the first quarter, there are few signs of a strong economic rebound. The assertion that the UK economy has decisively turned the corner, as recently asserted by the Prime Minister, is still yet to find confirmation in the data. City experts sound confident that the UK economy will pull itself out of recession. Today\u2019s news that the economy grew by 0.1% in February and 0.3% in January bolsters hopes that GDP did not shrink in the January-March quarter. If that happens, it would end the techncial recession that gripped the country in the second half of 2023, when GDP shrank in Q3 and Q4 2023. Having said that, though, growth 0f 0.1% in February isn\u2019t exactly rollicking. Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot, says: \u201cThe UK has continued its positive start to the year as GDP grew again in February, albeit only marginally, and looks on course to be pulled out of the short and shallow recession it entered at the end of last year. \u201cUK GDP is estimated to have risen 0.1% in February, a slight dip compared to January\u2019s 0.3% growth which was revised up from 0.2%, but still positive nonetheless. This uptick was driven primarily by improvements in the UK\u2019s services and production sectors. Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors, says: \u201cThe UK economy grew, albeit very modestly, in February, suggesting that any sort of meaningful recession will be avoided. With inflation tracking back, the Bank of England might be persuaded to start cutting rates sooner rather than later and after the CPI data out of the US and the ECB meeting over the last week, we could well see the Fed being the last of the three to take any action on rates. That would quite a shift over a period of a few months.\u201d \u201cThe sun is finally out but the UK economy outlook remains foggy\u201d says Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK. \u201cDespite weaker momentum in February, the economy\u2019s ongoing recovery is the latest piece of evidence that the shallow technical recession is already behind us. Growth was helped by the January cut in National Insurance, a further boost to purchasing power from falling inflation, and an easing in cost pressures for businesses. Combined with more timely survey data, we expect GDP to grow at around 0.3% over Q1. \u201cNonetheless, there are limits to the UK\u2019s growth potential this year. Consumer spending remains fragile. Business investment could be dented by uncertainty related to the general election and growing speculation around a second fiscal event in the Autumn, while weakness in the housing market could further drag on construction by lowering the return on new housebuilding. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has welcomed the news that the UK economy grew by 0.1% in February, saying: \u201cThese figures are a welcome sign that the economy is turning a corner, and we can build on this progress if we stick to our plan. \u201cLast week our cuts to National Insurance for 29 million working people came into effect across Britain, as part of our plan to reward work and grow the economy.\u201d Britain\u2019s economy has taken a step closer to exiting recession after official figures showed growth continued in February despite a washout month for retailers after one of the wettest starts to a year on record. Here\u2019s the full story: The UK economy is putting further distance from last year\u2019s recession, says Jeremy Batstone-Carr, European strategist at Raymond James Investment Services \u201cData released this morning by the ONS shows that UK GDP expanded by 0.1% in February. This signals a further move away from the shallow economic contraction experienced over the second half of 2023. \u201cMore evidence supports this revival. Service sector output delivered a second consecutive month of expansion, which, paired with upbeat retail sales and forward-looking business surveys, point to strengthened activity in March. Industrial output remains below pre-pandemic levels, and gas and electricity output were subdued by mild weather. But a broad revival is nonetheless underway, as part of an improving global outlook. \u201cToday\u2019s data indicates that the UK\u2019s economic trajectory is on a shallow but steady upward course. The measures introduced in the March Budget will further enhance prospects in the short term. However, decelerating inflation paves the way for the Bank of England to commence its rate cutting process in the coming months, a decision which should also prove supportive to the growth outlook.\u201d Britain\u2019s industrial sector was the largest contributor to growth in February. Today\u2019s GDP report shows that production output grew by 1.1% in February, more than reversing a 0.3% drop in January. Manufacturing output rose by 1.2%, driven by a surge in manufacturing of transport equipment such as cars. The services sector had a calmer month \u2013 it grew by 0.1% in February, slower than the 0.3% growth in January. And it was a month to forget for builders, with construction output falling by 1.9% in February. The ONS cites \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d that heavy rainfall delayed planned work and decreasing output in February. Here\u2019s ONS director of economic statistics Liz McKeown on the news that the UK economy grew by 0.1% in February: \u201cThe economy grew slightly in February with widespread growth across manufacturing, particularly in the car sector. Services also grew a little with public transport and haulage, and telecommunications having strong months. \u201cPartially offsetting this there were notable falls across construction as the wet weather hampered many building projects. \u201cLooking across the last three months as a whole, the economy grew for the first time since last summer.\u201d Newsflash: the UK continued to grow in February, boosting hopes that the economy is escaping recession. GDP expanded by 0.1% in February, new data from the Office for National Statistics shows, lifted by growth in the production and services sectors. And the ONS has lifted its forecast for January, to show 0.3% growth, up from 0.2% previously estimated. This suggests the economy may manage to grow in the first quarter of 2024. And that would mean the short, shallow recession that began at the end of 2023 will officially end. Even if the economy is growing again, households are still struggling. Half of consumers have cut back on their non-essential spending so far this year, with eating out the most likely thing to be cut from budgets, a survey this morning shows. Just 3% of consumers say that they have been able to spend more on non-essentials in the first quarter, with 52% cutting back, according to the KPMG Consumer Pulse survey. Eating out was the most common discretionary spending cut, listed by 72% of those who are scaling back, followed by clothing purchases (62%) and takeaways (58%). Sanjay Raja, Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief UK economist, predicts wet weather and lower energy production will mean UK growth slower in February, to 0.1%. But he also believes the economy is at a \u2018turning point\u2019 after last year\u2019s shallow recession. Raja explains: After matching our estimates in January, we expect GDP growth to slow to 0.1% m-o-m in February 2024 (Jan-24: 0.2% m-o-m). What\u2019s driving the slowdown? Wetter weather and lower oil/energy production will, we think, keep GDP from budging very much. Overall, we see services activity and industrial production up 0.1% m-o-m, respectively, with construction output flat on the month. Looking ahead, we think the UK economy is at a turning point following on from its short and shallow recession last year. We see GDP picking up by 0.2% q-o-q in Q1-24, and pushing to 0.3% - 0.4% q-o-q for the remainder of the year. For 2024 as a whole, we see GDP up 0.5%, rising by 1.5% next year. Good morning. We\u2019re about to learn whether the UK is climbing out of the recession into which it slipped at the end of last year. At 7am, the Office for National Statistics will release its first estimate for UK GDP in February, and the City are hoping to see signs of growth. Economists predict that GDP rose by 0.1% in February; a weak expansion, following 0.2% growth in January. That would raise the chances that the economy grew in the first quarter of 2024 \u2013 which would end the recession. Reminder: The UK ended 2023 in a technical recession, after shrinking slightly in both the third and fourth quarters of last year. To escape recession, it needs to not shrink in January-March (and that data is due in a month\u2019s time). Bad weather may have weighed on UK growth this year, though. We already know that retail sales growth slowed during a wet February, when storms kept people at home. Any signs that the downturn is over would be welcomed by the government, with a general election close. But the financial markets are not being very kind to Rishi Sunak this week. The PM\u2019s hopes that the public might see lower taxes and cheaper mortgages soon have weakened, as traders scaled back expectations of interest rate cuts in 2024 yesterday. The City now expects just two quarter-point cuts to UK interest rates in 2024, which would lower rates by half a percentage point to 4.75% by December. Today\u2019s GDP report may not change the outlook for rate cuts, explains Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell: UK GDP figures are expected to be tepid, not too hot or too cold, and unlikely to do much to change thinking at the Bank of England. \u201cWhere just a few months ago markets were betting rates here in the UK could fall below 4% by Christmas now only two cuts are being priced in. The sands are shifting and investors are having to be fleet of foot.\u201d The agenda 7am BST: UK GDP report for February Noon BST: Bank of England to publish review of its forecasting models 1pm BST: India\u2019s inflation rate for March 3pm BST: University of Michigan\u2019s index of US consumer confidence"

            "content": "Taiwan\u2019s president Tsai Ing-wen has praised the US Congress for passing a sweeping foreign aid package this week which included arms support for the island, and has drawn the ire of China. After months of delays and contentious debate, the bill was signed into law by Joe Biden on Wednesday. Described as $95bn in aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, the legislation actually contains provisions that broadly affect many parts of the Asia-Pacific, while also spending billions of dollars at home in America. House Republicans billed the $8.1bn for the Indo-Pacific as an effort to \u201ccounter communist China and ensure a strong deterrence in the region,\u201d however the largest provision of funding is for projects in the US itself. In the face of delayed shipbuilding projects, $3.3bn of the bill will go towards the US domestic submarine-building industry. $1.9bn is designated for a Columbia-class submarine \u2013 America\u2019s newest class of nuclear-powered submarine \u2013 the first of which is due to be delivered in 2027. Another $200m is designated for a Virginia-class submarine. The vast majority of this money will be spent in the United States, with more than 16,000 suppliers across all 50 states set to benefit, according to Connor Fiddler at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. \u201cNearly half of the Indo-Pacific appropriations directly reinforce the submarine industrial base,\u201d Fiddler wrote in his analysis of the package. \u201cWhile this investment will enhance deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, the immediate impact will be supporting the American economy.\u201d The submarine funding was a condition of congressional endorsement of the Aukus deal between the US, UK and Australia, and is aimed at ensuring the US can produce Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines for Australia without undermining its own capability requirements. Another $2bn of funding in the aid package will go towards the foreign military financing program for Taiwan and other security partners in the Indo-Pacific, who the US says are \u201cconfronting Chinese aggression.\u201d According to US officials, the foreign financing program allows eligible partner nations to \u201cpurchase US defense articles, services, and training\u201d. A further $1.9bn will go towards defence related expenses provided to Taiwan and other regional partners, while $542m will specifically strengthen US military capabilities in the region. On Wednesday, China criticised the package, saying that such funding was pushing Taiwan into a \u201cdangerous situation.\u201d Beijing\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office said the aid \u201cseriously violates\u201d US commitments to China and \u201csends a wrong signal to the Taiwan independence separatist forces.\u201d Separately, Taiwan has signed billions in contracts with the US for latest-generation F-16V fighter jets, M1 Abrams main battle tanks and the HIMARS rocket system, which the US has also supplied to Ukraine. The United States is Taiwan\u2019s most important international backer and arms supplier even in the absence of formal diplomatic ties. China, which views Taiwan as its own territory, has repeatedly demanded arms sales stop. The Associated Press contributed to this report"

            "title": "Rising unemployment points to worrying signs for UK economy",
            "date": "2024-04-16T11:02:12Z",
            "content": "The government has patted itself on the back in recent years for presiding over a period of low unemployment, but underneath the latest headline figures there are concerning trends. First among the worrying signs is an increase in the number of working age people leaving the labour market because of ill-health, who need to take on caring responsibilities or retire early. In February, the UK economic inactivity rate for those aged 16 to 64 years was 22.2%, which means about 275,000 more people than a year ago. In 2022, there was optimism that a sharp rise in the inactivity rate during the three Covid-19 lockdowns was coming down quickly and normality was being restored to the jobs market. Those who were ill from Covid and its longer-term effects were finding their way back to the workforce and early retirement, which had proved exceptionally popular among the over-55s, was losing its allure. That trend reversed last year, leaving ministers to scratch their heads about the causes. Experts in the employment field were in no doubt that the government\u2019s battle with NHS unions and delays to bringing down waiting lists played a big part. Benefit cuts that have reduced payments to disabled people and a mental health service in crisis have also been factors. Then there is the rise of childcare costs and the increasing price of residential care for older and disabled people that has forced many families to step into the breach, accepting they will work fewer paid hours themselves. Tony Wilson, the director of the Institute for Employment Studies, was one of many to blame the government\u2019s lacklustre efforts to improve mental health support, and slow response to the rise of school leavers not in education, training or work. The number of apprenticeship places for young people is low even as childcare businesses struggle to recruit staff. Charlie McCurdy, an economist at the Resolution Foundation, said rising redundancies and falling job levels were signs of a stagnant economy, \u201cwhile rising inactivity and long-term sickness suggest there are wider issues with the health of our workforce\u201d. He said: \u201cTackling rising inactivity \u2013 and its impact on the public finances, the benefits system, and people\u2019s wider health and wellbeing \u2013 is one of the biggest economic challenges facing both this government, and whoever wins the next election.\u201d Ministers can comfort themselves that the immediate bill from a weak labour market is low. The claimant count for March increased by 10,900 on the month and is up by 57,400 on the year to 1.583 million. By this measure, unemployment was considered to be resilient. After all, the number of people signing on for unemployment benefits was relatively small when set against a long period of economic stagnation that culminated in recession in the second half of 2023. However, a fall of 156,000 in the number of people in employment in the last quarter to the end of February on the previous one, gives a clearer sign that all is not well. Add the wider cost to society from lost economic growth, careers forgone by people needing to care for loved ones and growing ill-health, and the situation is worse than it looks at first glance."

            "content": "Matteo Garrone\u2019s new film is part adventure story, part slavery drama; the slavery which did not in fact vanish with the end of the American civil war, but thrives in the globalised present day without needing to shapeshift too much, driven by the age-old forces of geopolitics and the market. Seydou and Moussa, played by nonprofessional acting newcomers Seydou Sarr and Moustapha Fall, are 16-year-old cousins in Dakar, Senegal, dreaming of escape to the fabled land of the EU as refugees, where they expect to go viral and make a fortune as music stars like the people they\u2019re watching on TikTok. For years they have been writing songs and secretly working on building sites while pretending to go to football practice, amassing cash savings which in the succeeding months they will hand over to various gangmasters, fixers and corrupt gun-wielding soldiers. The boys get into Niger on fake Malian passports whose obvious inauthenticity generates a handsome bribe-income for crooked border guards. They pay handsomely to join a group crossing the Sahara to Libya in an unsafe van; they then have to go on foot in the burning sand, their hatchet-faced drivers and guides ignoring the people who fall out of the vehicle or collapse with exhaustion on the way. In Libya the boys are separated, one taken to what passes for official custody, the other to a prison used as a torture factory and cash slave-farm by Libyan warlords. Here, terrified migrants are told to get their parents to wire their entire life savings over if they don\u2019t want their children to be brutalised and killed; this is a truly terrifying sequence. The official and unofficial jails are brought by Garrone into ironic parallel. The boys are ultimately able to offer the tiny residue of their savings to join a crowded boat heading across the Med to Italy. The gangsters chillingly agree on condition that the teenage torture survivor, Seydou, will be the boat\u2019s notional captain \u2013 hence the movie\u2019s title. The gangmaster pretends to \u201ctrain\u201d him on how to navigate and use the GPS and he is then put in charge of all the trusting, terrified adults as they put to sea. This is a movie with passion and sweep, although I was less sure about the fantasy-reverie sequences. Reality is stronger ground. Apart from everything else, Io Capitano delivers some home-truths about the boats used; they are notionally \u201ccaptained\u201d by one of the passengers, a wretched soul who, due to a nauseating twist of fate, may well be even less qualified and less able than everyone else. And the film shows a gruesome irony at work: refugees are part of a toxic hoax economy. The fixers know well that these people will almost certainly die en masse in the desert or the ocean, and will be in no position to ask for refunds or warn anyone else. Garrone shows Seydou battling heroically against this bad faith while growing miraculously into his captain status, despite the existential irony at work. Seydou and the others are not exactly masters of their fate, or captains of their souls, to quote WE Henley\u2019s Invictus. They are swept along by power and inequality, but Garrone shows that their humanity and compassion are still buoyant. \u2022 Io Capitano is in UK and Irish cinemas from 5 April."

The financial value of a Swift gig is of such national importance that Singapore reportedly paid her up to $3m (\u00a32.4m) a show to ensure it was the only place to host Swift on her jaunt to the region this spring, prompting complaints from Thailand and the Philippines. In the words of one Filipino politician: \u201c[It] isn\u2019t what good neighbours do.\u201d If $3m sounds like an awful lot to secure a concert exclusive, that\u2019s small change when you consider the benefits \u2013 it\u2019s estimated that her six shows have boosted the Singapore economy by $370m. Singaporean government ministers aren\u2019t the only ones looking at Swift with dollar signs in their eyes. With the singer en route to Britain this summer, hotels and Airbnb landlords here have hiked their rates accordingly. A Swiftie friend of mine is considering paying \u00a3419 for a bed in Edinburgh at the Holiday Inn. Call it dynamic pricing, or just plain old daylight robbery.

Unfortunately, stolen mobiles are par for the course in London \u2013 two-fifths of robberies here are phone-related, with one snatched almost every six minutes in 2022. The real question is where all these stolen phones are going. According to the Met police officer I spoke to, on a borrowed mobile, lots of them apparently end up in Dubai, where they are sold on to unsuspecting customers. Unfortunately, it seems almost impossible for theft victims like myself to see any kind of justice \u2013 within 24 hours of the police looking up the CCTV (or rather, the lack thereof), my case was closed.

            "date": "2024-04-30T11:00:58Z",
            "content": "The eurozone has bounced back from its shallow technical recession after a stronger than expected performance by its \u201cbig four\u201d economies in the first three months of 2024. After two successive quarters of 0.1% contraction in the second half of 2023, the 20 nations that use the single currency posted growth of 0.3% between January and March. Figures from the European Commission\u2019s statistical agency \u2013 Eurostat \u2013 showed the eurozone had put in its best growth performance since the third quarter of 2022. Financial markets had been expecting 0.2% growth. Lower energy prices, falling inflation, rising real wages and the prospect of cuts in interest rates helped to boost activity after a downbeat 2023 in which the eurozone only grew in one quarter. Europe\u2019s two biggest economies \u2013 Germany and France \u2013 grew by 0.2%, while Italy and Spain posted growth of 0.3% and 0.7% respectively. Germany\u2019s performance in the final three months of 2023 was worse than originally thought: the economy contracted by 0.5% rather than 0.3%. Of the smaller EU economies, the best performing were Ireland, which grew by 1.1% in the first three months of 2024, and Latvia, Lithuania and Hungary, which expanded by 0.8%. Separate Eurostat data showed headline eurozone inflation remained unchanged in April at 2.4%, while core inflation \u2013 which excludes energy and food \u2013 came down from 2.9% to 2.7%. Although the eurozone\u2019s growth performance in the first quarter was stronger than the European Central Bank had been forecasting, analysts said lower inflation paved the way for interest rate cuts in the months ahead. Sam Miley, the managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: \u201cThis morning\u2019s confirmation of quarterly growth in the first quarter has put an end to a short-lived recession in the eurozone, with the economy having turned a corner since the beginning of 2024. \u201cProspects are likely to improve further throughout the year, driven by the expectation of interest rate cuts.\u201d Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cWhile the eurozone\u2019s mild recession appears to be over, we think the economy will expand at only a moderate pace over the rest of the year.\u201d Some of the improvement in the first three months of 2024 was due to temporary factors, such as a rebound in construction, while business surveys also pointed to sluggish growth, Kenningham said. UK first quarter growth figures are due out next week, with the financial markets anticipating 0.3% growth and an end to the mild recession recorded in the second half of 2023. Figures from the Bank of England showed mortgage approvals for house purchases rose from 60,500 in February to 61,300 in March, taking them to the highest level since September 2022. The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee will make its latest decision on interest rates next week, but is expected to leave official borrowing costs unchanged at 5.25%. \u2022 This article was amended on 1 May 2024. An earlier version said that Hungary was in the eurozone instead of in the EU."

            "date": "2024-04-30T11:42:53Z",
            "content": "Fears that Vladimir Putin is trying to fill the European parliament with more pro-Russia MEPs were behind the EU\u2019s blunt message to the Silicon Valley owner of Facebook on Tuesday. It gave Meta just five days to explain how it will root out fake news, fake websites and stop adverts funded by the Kremlin or face severe measures. Forty days out from the European parliamentary elections \u2013 and during a year in which countries with more than half the world\u2019s population go to the polls \u2013 deep concerns about how Facebook is dealing with fake news were behind the warning. \u201cThe integrity of the election is an enforcement priority,\u201d said Thierry Breton, the commissioner for internal market, warning that the European Commission would be quick to respond if Facebook did not rectify the problems within the week. \u201cWe expect Meta to inform us of the actions they are taking to address these risks in five working days or we will take all necessary measures to defend our democracy,\u201d he said. The commission confirmed it had launched formal proceedings against Meta as the clock ticks down to elections being held across Europe on 6-9 June. The commission is extremely concerned that Russia will use Facebook, which has more than 250 million monthly active users, to try to swing votes in its favour. As the Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said earlier this month, after a formal investigation into alleged payments by the Kremlin to MEPs, the objective of Russia is \u201cvery clear\u201d: to help \u201celect more pro-Russian candidates in the European parliament\u201d. Officials declined to give precise examples but some are blatant, including adverts paid for by foreign agents. \u201cIt is fundamentally wrong they [Facebook] are making money on this,\u201d said an official. They also say the tools to flag illegal or suspicious content are not visible enough. Links to fake news platforms, known as \u201cdoppelganger sites\u201d, are not being removed quickly enough or at all, the EU suggests. Last week a Czech news agency website was hacked to display fake news including claims that an assassination attempt on the Slovak president had been foiled. At the same time France\u2019s Europe minister, Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, said the country was being \u201cpounded\u201d by Russian propaganda with \u201cdeliberate manoeuvres to disrupt public debate and interfere in the campaign for the European elections\u201d. Another concern on Facebook is Meta\u2019s decision to \u201csuppress\u201d discourse in an effort to de-risk user-generated content on sensitive subjects such as the Middle East. This is known as \u201cshadow banning\u201d, and the EU wants Facebook to be more transparent in how it justifies these decisions. \u201cUsers need to know about it when it happens and they need to be able to appeal it, otherwise this is a discourse risk,\u201d said an official. It is also concerned that Facebook was planning to discontinue a service called CrowdTangle that helped factcheckers, journalists and researchers to monitor disinformation. Tuesday\u2019s proceedings against Facebook are the sixth taken by the European Commission since the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA) came into force. But is it enough to stop the lies? Even officials in Nato, on a panel in Brussels in February, said they were treating disinformation as potent a weapon as bullets and missiles. Officials say it is not that Facebook is \u201cnot doing anything\u201d, it is just that the measures in place are weak, opaque and not effective enough. Under sweeping new laws under the DSA, which came into force in August, the EU can fine social media companies up to 6% of their revenue or ban them from the union altogether. Facebook said: \u201cWe have a well-established process for identifying and mitigating risks on our platforms. We look forward to continuing our cooperation with the European Commission and providing them with further details of this work.\u201d"

            "title": "The pro-Israel groups planning to spend millions in US elections",
            "date": "2024-04-22T10:00:23Z",
            "content": "A handful of pro-Israel groups fund political campaigns in support of individual candidates in US elections, led by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), a powerful force in American politics. Before the 2024 election, Aipac plans to spend tens of millions of dollars against congressional candidates, primarily Democrats, whom it deems insufficiently supportive of Israel. Aipac and other pro-Israel lobby groups have recruited and supported challengers to a number of lawmakers and candidates \u2013 most notably members of the Squad, the group of progressive representatives who are particularly vocal in their criticism of Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza. The 2024 election will be bellwether of the enduring impact of these groups on US politics amid shifting US public opinion on Israel. What is Aipac? Aipac has its roots in the American Zionist Committee for Public Affairs, which was founded by a lobbyist for the Israeli government in an attempt to manage the political fallout the Israeli army\u2019s 1953 massacre of dozens of Palestinians, most of them children and women, in the West Bank village of Qibya. The organisation was renamed Aipac in 1959. It was not until financial support surged after the 1973 Yom Kippur war that it began to grow into the powerful Washington lobbyist group it is today. For many years, Aipac\u2019s influence went largely unchallenged on Capitol Hill. The pressure group claimed to voice bipartisan support for Israel in Congress and worked to marginalise the relatively small number of critics there. Aipac\u2019s annual conference typically involved a long rollcall of members of Congress who support the group. It has regularly galvanised almost every member of the US Senate to sign letters in support of Israeli policies, including several wars in Gaza. But the group\u2019s once unchallenged influence in Washington has been diminished by its unwavering backing for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, over the past 15 years. It sided with him against President Barack Obama\u2019s opposition to settlement construction in the occupied Palestinian territories and his nuclear deal with Iran. The liberal Tel Aviv newspaper Haaretz has described Aipac as \u201cthe pro-Netanyahu, anti-Israel lobby\u201d. \u201cEffectively, the organization has become an operational wing of Netanyahu\u2019s far-right government, one that peddles a false image of a liberal Israel in the United States and sells illusions to members of Congress,\u201d it said. What has changed? Aipac traditionally endorsed candidates sympathetic to Israel as a signal for others to fund their campaigns. But in December 2021, the group for the first time in its 70-year history moved into direct financial support for individual political campaigns by launching a super political action committee, the United Democracy Project (UDP). A Super Pac is permitted to spend without restriction for or against candidates but cannot make direct donations to their campaigns. The move was prompted by alarm at the erosion of longstanding bipartisan support for Israel in the US. Opinion polls show younger Democrats have grown more critical of the deepening oppression of the Palestinians, including Jewish Americans, a trend that has only strengthened with the present war in Gaza. Aipac has grown increasingly concerned that the election of candidates critical of Israel could open the door to the conditioning of the US\u2019s considerable military aid, erosion of Washington\u2019s diplomatic protection on the international stage, and political pressure to establish a Palestinian state. So the UDP is working to block Democratic candidates critical of Israel at the first hurdle \u2013 the primaries \u2013 in an effort to shore up the claim that there is unswerving support for the Jewish state across Congress. It is also targeting progressive Democratic members of Congress who have pressed for a ceasefire in Gaza. What about other lobby groups? A number of smaller groups are working to the same end, principally the Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI). It was founded five years ago by Mark Mellman, a Democratic political consultant. The DMFI\u2019s board of directors includes Archie Gottesman, who also co-founded JewBelong, a group that has posted pink billboards in US cities in support of Israel including one that declared: \u2018Trust Me. If Israel Wanted to Commit Genocide in Gaza, It Could\u2019. Notably, the UDP has so far not waded into the campaign against Summer Lee in this year\u2019s primary, despite spending more than $3m to defeat her in 2022. Instead the Republican mega-donor Jeffrey Yass has stepped up as the largest funder of a Pac called Moderate Pac to support Lee\u2019s primary opponent, Bhavini Patel. It is running ads saying that Lee\u2019s criticisms of Biden amount to support for Donald Trump even though Yass himself is a Trump supporter. A more moderate pro-Israel group, J Street, was founded in 2007 to counter Aipac\u2019s unflinching support for rightwing governments. J Street established a Pac to support candidates who back a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. But it has raised only about $4m so far this election cycle. Who are they targeting and how? Aipac plans to spend $100m this year against congressional candidates, primarily Democrats, and members of Congress critical of Israel. So far the UDP has raised more than $49m, according to its most recent Federal Election Commission filings. The bulk of that money has yet to be spent but the UDP has already thrown millions of dollars into political advertising targeted against candidates critical of Israel, but which focuses on other issues and fails to make clear that it is funded by a pro-Israel group. Critics have accused Aipac of attempting to intimidate candidates into avoiding criticism of Israel by implicitly threatening to fund campaigns against them. Among those expected to be targeted by pro-Israel groups are members of the the Squad, including Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush, who are thought to be vulnerable to political attacks over issues unrelated to their criticisms of the war in Gaza. Who is funding these campaigns? The leading donors to the UDP are Republicans seeking to influence Democratic primaries. The single largest donor is the conservative Ukrainian American billionaire co-founder of WhatsApp, Jan Koum, who gave $5m. Koum also donated to the Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley\u2019s Super Pac. Other donors include the financier, Jonathan Jacobson, who gave $2.5m to the UDP toward the end of last year although for many years his political donations were directed to the Republican National Committee and the party\u2019s US Senate campaigns. The Israeli-born entrepreneur David Zalik gave the UDP $2m. He has also donated to Republican campaigns in Georgia. The Home Depot founder Bernie Marcus, who was one of the largest donors to Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and who continues to back him financially, gave $1m to the UDP, as did the hedge fund manager Paul Singer, who has given millions of dollars to Republican political causes over the years. Donations to the UDP are separate from tens of millions of dollars in pledges made directly to Aipac in the wake of the 7 October attacks by Hamas as the public relations battle intensified over Israel\u2019s subsequent assault on Gaza and a surging number of Palestinian civilian deaths. Top donors to the DMFI include Deborah Simon, the daughter of the billionaire businessman and movie producer Mel Simon, who gave $1m. She regularly donates to Democratic causes and Jewish organisations such as the Anti-Defamation League. Sam Bankman-Fried, the former cryptocurrency billionaire who is serving 25 years for fraud, gave $250,000 to DMFI during the 2022 midterm elections. The group has been forced to return the money. Other major DMFI donors are closely tied to Aipac such as Stacy Schusterman, who has given more than $1m, and the venture capitalist Gary Lauder. How has the present war in Gaza changed the equation? The conflict has strengthened the hand of Israel\u2019s critics within the Democratic party as polls show rising sympathy for the Palestinians. That in turn has made Aipac\u2019s financial backing a potential liability for some Israel-supporting Democratic candidates. Aipac was already on the defensive after endorsing the 2022 campaigns of dozens of Republican members of Congress who tried to block President Biden\u2019s presidential victory. Aipac defended the move by claiming that backing for the Jewish state overrides other issues and that it was \u201cno moment for the pro-Israel movement to become selective about its friends\u201d. \u201cWhen we launched our political action committee last year, we decided that we would base decisions about political contributions on only one thing: whether a political candidate supports the US-Israel relationship,\u201d it said."

            "content": "Bombs and chaos no bar to voters By David Beresford in Johannesburg 27 April 1994 South Africans defied organisational chaos, personal hardship and long queues to throng polling stations yesterday for the historic all-race election that crowned their long march towards democracy. While the authorities were under growing pressure last night to extend the three-day poll after serious problems in the first day of voting, the momentum for freedom looked unstoppable, with a new nation coming into effect at the stroke of midnight when the old flag was lowered and the new constitution took effect. \u201cToday is a day like no other before it \u2026 today marks the dawn of our freedom,\u201d said Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader who is expected to become the country\u2019s first black president. Mr Mandela spent 27 of his 75 years in jail for fighting apartheid. \u201cYears of imprisonment could not stamp out our determination to be free. Years of intimidation and violence could not stop us and we will not be stopped now,\u201d he said. President FW de Klerk, whose decision in 1990 to abandon apartheid, opened the way to the new South Africa, said: \u201cI wanted this election to take place \u2026 that is what I have been working for.\u201d Around the country, the infirm, elderly and sick defied both a rightwing bombing campaign and widespread problems at polling stations in an extraordinary demonstration of hunger for the franchise.

Eyewitness: cheers, tears and God Bless Africa as the new flag is raised By Jonathan Steele in Cape Town 27 April 1994 With cheers, tears, and a multitude of hugs, the flag of white rule in South Africa was ceremonially lowered last night, three and a half centuries after the first European settlers landed near the Cape of Good Hope. With it ended the last act in the decolonisation of Africa and the end of the dream of a European empire which would stretch, in Cecil Rhodes\u2019 phrase, \u201cFrom Cairo to the Cape\u201d. A multiracial crowd of several hundred gathered shortly before midnight outside the provincial administration buildings to watch the new flag replace the old. On the balcony a choir sang the old \u201cnational\u201d anthem, Die Stem, and then as the new flag went up, the first verse of the new anthem, God Bless Africa. At the same time, an interim democratic constitution came into force as South Africans of all colours headed into a second day of elections signalling an end to more than three centuries of white domination. \u201cI am here to see this moment of history,\u201d said Ishmail Jacobs, standing with a group of fellow Muslims. \u201cIt may be sad for some people, but my forefathers had nothing to do with the old flag.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve watched the Berlin Wall come down on television, and all the other changes in Europe\u201d, said Albie Sachs, one of the veterans of the anti-apartheid struggle. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice that this change is happening here at home in our country.\u201d Even an Afrikaner policeman standing discreetly with his colleagues below the building was pleased. \u201cI am glad that the government eventually took people into account. This is the people\u2019s flag.\u201d Similar ceremonies were held in the capital cities of South Africa\u2019s eight other new provinces, but none had as deep a resonance as the one in the Cape, the cradle of white minority rule on the toe of Africa. Outside parliament, people formed a conga line and danced around a statue of the Boer general, Louis Botha. At the legislature, boisterous African National Congress supporters chanted Nelson Mandela\u2019s name and waved ANC banners. The country\u2019s old standard, featuring the flags of Britain and two Boer republics set against an orange, white and blue field, was first raised outside parliament on 31 May 1928. It incorporated symbols of imperialism and settlement but there was no African element. The new flag, designed by a multiparty committee, is not beautiful. It is like a letter Y on its side in six different colours, and South Africans are already calling it the Y-front. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess,\u201d conceded Albie Sachs. But no one seemed to mind last night. What mattered was not the design but the change that it represents. Vote of the century opens era of hope By Gary Younge 28 April 1994 As dawn broke over Zone 9 of Meadowlands, Soweto, yesterday, the Mwale family was preparing for power. First there was water to boil since the rumour had spread that the rightwing AWB might poison Meadowlands\u2019 main tank. Esther Mwale said \u201cmost people with sense\u201d in Zone 9 were boiling water. Then, there was the huge pot of mealies \u2013 a staple of the township diet \u2013 to cook. On Tuesday, Granny had waited seven hours to cast her vote and they had had to bring her dinner while she queued. If there were long delays today, it would be her turn to come to the rescue. Finally, there were the ID documents to find. No one could say the Mwales were not ready for democracy. As they set off at 7am, joining a human stream of hundreds on the main road, it seemed that all of Zone 9 had the same idea; first watch Nelson Mandela cast his vote in Durban on the television and then get down to the polling station at the Maponyane school quickly to beat the rush. The clientele of Johannes\u2019 shebeen (township bar) had discussed this eventuality the night before. At the beginning of the evening, Jacob\u2019s solution to avoiding Tuesday\u2019s chaos was to get there early. A couple of hours and a few beers later, the prospect of waking up at 5am and queueing for two hours looked increasingly unattractive. Mzimasi suggested going to vote in a white suburb, where the queues would be shorter, but nobody knew anyone with a car who could take them. Johannes said he was voting ANC \u201cfor his children\u201d. But nobody else was prepared to say how they would vote. The talk was of logistics, not politics. Nevertheless, the sight of a white woman, who had cast her vote abroad, saying tearfully on television, \u201cI\u2019m just scared about the future,\u201d aroused some fierce emotion.

            "date": "2024-04-04T10:00:08Z",
            "content": "While it was clear that Joe Biden and Donald Trump would win their respective primary elections in Wisconsin on Tuesday, voters in the state dealt other surprises by supporting Republican-backed election amendments and registering a significant anti-war protest vote. Wisconsin voters enshrined in the state constitution on Tuesday two amendments that election officials and voting rights advocates worry will hurt election administration in the state. The first bans election offices from accessing private grants \u2013 a source of revenue that election officials relied on in 2020 to run elections during the pandemic and have since used to stock voting equipment in polling places. During the 2020 elections, election offices across the country \u2013 already chronically underfunded \u2013 accessed grants from the Center for Tech and Civic Life, a non-profit organization funded by Mark Zuckerberg, the Meta CEO, and his wife, Priscilla Chan. The grants were doled out with the explicit purpose of funding Covid-19 mitigation in polling places, and election offices used the money for things like personal protective equipment and to set up drive-through, contactless voting. The former mayor of Milwaukee, Tom Barrett, called the grants at the time a \u201cwise investment\u201d in light of long lines at polling places in Milwaukee during the spring elections, and the Rev Greg Lewis, director of Souls to the Polls, described the stakes as \u201ca matter of life and death\u201d for Black residents who were disproportionately affected as Covid-19 spread across Wisconsin in 2020. In the wake of the 2020 election, Republicans blasted the grant funding, claiming without evidence that it had helped Biden with the election. The funding, pejoratively dubbed \u201cZuckerbucks\u201d by GOP activists, has remained a key grievance of the Republican party \u2013 with 27 states enacting similar measures since 2020. Claire Woodall, executive director of the Milwaukee election commission, said on Wednesday that without the funding, \u201cwhat goes into my budget request for election years will be higher \u2013 and the city will have to look to other departments for funding\u201d. Just as consequential for election administration in Wisconsin is a second ballot measure passed on Tuesday, which adds an amendment to the state constitution requiring that \u201conly election officials designated by law may perform tasks in the conduct of primaries, elections, and referendums\u201d. Like the first amendment, the second one was also initially introduced by the GOP-controlled state legislature as a bill that the legislature sent to voters only after the Democratic governor, Tony Evers, killed it with a veto. It is not immediately clear how the amendment, which very closely resembles existing state statute declaring that \u201conly election officials\u201d are allowed to \u201cconduct an election\u201d, could affect the administration of elections in Wisconsin. Voting rights groups and critics of the amendment worry the minor disparity between the language in the new constitutional amendment and the existing language in state statute could introduce questions about the role of the many non-election officials whose work is nonetheless vital in ensuring smooth elections. \u201cWhat does it mean to \u2018perform a task?\u2019\u201d said Ann Jacobs, a Democratic commissioner on the bipartisan Wisconsin elections commission. \u201cDoes the person who prints the ballots perform a task? Does the company that programs the tabulators perform a task? Does the maintenance person who moves the tables at a voting site perform a task?\u201d The commission will issue guidance on those very questions to election clerks across the state in a few weeks, Jacobs said. Whether the Wisconsin elections commission\u2019s guidance will hold is a separate matter. The new language could open the door to litigation, potentially leading to a court interpretation of the amendment that is broader than current state statute. \u201cThis really comes down to how broadly we interpret the constitutional amendment,\u201d said Emily Lau, a staff attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin. The courts could, theoretically, affirm existing processes \u2013 and could even look to the amendment banning private funding as an opportunity to ensure full public funding for election offices. An overly broad interpretation of the second ballot measure, on the other hand, could wreak chaos on the electoral process and lead to \u201csubverting elections, in that it would prevent election officials from being able to run safe, secure elections\u201d, said Lau. Voters register discontent with party nominees Meanwhile, voters registered their discontent with the presumptive nominees of both parties in the state\u2019s closely watched presidential primary election. The Listen to Wisconsin campaign, spearheaded by a coalition of progressive voters in the state, encouraged voters to fill in the \u201cuninstructed\u201d on their ballots instead of Joe Biden to send the president a message of disapproval over his handling of Israel\u2019s continuing war on Gaza. About 8% of voters \u2013 just over 48,000 in total \u2013 heeded their call, about double Biden\u2019s margin of victory in 2020. The uninstructed campaign was especially strong in Dane county, the home of University of Wisconsin-Madison, an area that Democrats can usually count on for strong support. \u201cToday, Wisconsinites all across the state woke up to a very strong showing of an anti-war, pro-peace movement in our state,\u201d said Reema Ahmed, the lead organizer of the Listen to Wisconsin campaign during a press conference Wednesday. \u201cThe way that Biden won Wisconsin [in 2020] was through a broad coalition \u2013 frankly, through a coalition of communities that are represented right here on this call, that were represented on this campaign.\u201d Many Republicans also voiced opposition to their presumptive nominee, the former president Donald Trump, with about 20% of voters choosing candidates that have already dropped out. \u201cIn both of these cases, it shows that there\u2019s a modest share of the party that is dissenting from the nominee,\u201d said Charles Franklin, professor of law and public policy and director of the Marquette Law School Poll. The unpopularity of the two presumptive nominees is not unprecedented, Franklin said: in 2016, voters were similarly dissatisfied with Clinton and Trump as the parties\u2019 chosen candidates. \u201cWhen two candidates are unpopular, it opens the gates for third party voting.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-17T12:35:38Z",
            "content": "Special elections for two vacant seats in the Michigan house of representatives flipped control back to Democrats, who organizers say could use their restored trifecta in the state to pass legislation protecting voting rights and election administration. A push to codify voter protections stalled after two Democratic lawmakers resigned and the party lost its majority in the house of representatives last November. With the election on Tuesday of Mai Xiong and Peter Herzberg, who represent sections of Detroit and its suburbs, legislators could use their newfound majorities to renew those efforts. In November 2022, Michigan voters passed a constitutional amendment enacting sweeping election reforms, including establishing early voting, expanding absentee voting and pre-empting the creation of stringent voter ID laws. The following year, the Democratic-controlled state legislature passed legislation to enact the amendment, setting aside more than $40m in the state budget to fund a measure to expand early and absentee voting, which was adopted by election clerks across the state. Despite some hiccups along the way, election offices across the state have succeeded in enacting the newly guaranteed nine days of early voting. Ahead of the 27 February presidential primary, more than 1 million Michiganders cast early and absentee votes \u2013 a record, according to the state. The secretary of state\u2019s office attributed the high turnout to the expanded early voting measure. In their last legislative session, Michigan lawmakers introduced other measures to protect voting rights \u2013 including establishing, through a package of bills, a state-level voting rights act and a ban on prison gerrymandering. The Michigan voting rights act forms part of a slew of measures states have taken to fill in the gaps left by weakened federal voting rights protections: New York, Connecticut, Virginia, Oregon, Washington and California have already passed such legislation. The Michigan voting rights act would add protections for disabled voters, ban voter suppression and expand the use of translated ballots for voters whose primary language is not English. A measure to ban prison gerrymandering would take into account the home addresses of incarcerated Michigan residents, rather than the location of their prison, when creating political districts. As it stands, people in prisons are counted as residents of the communities where they are incarcerated \u2013 inflating political representation in towns where prisons are located. Meanwhile, a set of bills banning guns at polling places, clerk\u2019s offices and ballot drop boxes cleared the state senate in February and could pass the house with its new Democratic majority. \u201cWe\u2019ve made so much progress with the big ballot proposals here in Michigan and with all the work that this pro-voter, pro-democracy legislature has done,\u201d said Jamie Lyons-Eddy, the executive director of the Michigan-based voting rights group Voters Not Politicians. \u201cBut even with all of that progress, communities that have been historically marginalized in our democracy continue to face barriers to accessing their constitutional right to vote.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-15T10:00:47Z",
            "content": "Two competing payday loan stores stand on the corners of an intersection in south Los Angeles. An area of persistent poverty, south LA is also a banking desert where payday lenders fill the gap. Long lines form inside the stores on the first of the month, when rent is due. Guillermina Molina, a 60-year-old retired housekeeper, visits the same Speedy Cash each month. During the summer months \u2013 which are becoming increasingly hot \u2013 she runs her air conditioner but frets about her utility bills. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard because the [power bill] is coming up too high because you gotta have the air conditioner on,\u201d Molina said. During heatwaves, Molina\u2019s daughter, Vanessa Vargas, checks in on her every day. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pull up to her house and find her [passed out] because of the heat,\u201d she said. Molina doesn\u2019t have savings, so to cover her bills she takes out a $225 payday loan every month, paying $45 in interest on each loan. When she\u2019s unable to pay back her loan on time, she\u2019s charged extra. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left over,\u201d Vargas said. Molina\u2019s financial struggles are common. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, 12 million Americans take out payday loans each year, paying $9bn in fees. New research suggests climate change is driving up demand for these loans. A study released earlier this year found that extreme temperature shocks \u2013 like heatwaves and cold snaps \u2013 are leading to surges in demand for payday loans in the US. The paper, published in January by the Bank of Canada, suggests extreme heat and cold may increase demand for payday loans in several ways: increased energy costs as people turn on heating or cooling devices, lost income for people who are unable to work in extreme heat, and health problems leading to medical costs for underinsured or uninsured people. \u201cWe are quite surprised with the fact that there is actually a strong effect stimulating increasing demand during extreme heat and cold days,\u201d said lead author Shihan Xie, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Illinois. Xie\u2019s study looked at satellite temperature data, a dataset of payday loan applications and zip codes to see how temperature affected loans. (The paper has not yet been peer reviewed, but Xie said it will be.) Researchers found that counties with higher populations of Hispanic people, who are overrepresented in outdoor jobs, see larger increases in demand for payday loans with extreme heat days. They also found that loan delinquency and default rates increased with more extreme heat days. Xie said the findings highlight the vulnerability of lower-income households to climate shocks and underscore the need for targeted policies, such as utility assistance programs that could help a consumer like Molina. \u201cWe hope we can provide more evidence on how the program could be better designed to help low-income households,\u201d Xie said. Payday loans are short-term, high-interest loans that are typically $500 or less. The lender typically gives the borrower cash in return for a postdated check timed to coincide with their next paycheck two to four weeks later. Fees are about $15 to $20 per $100 loan, which works out to a 400% to 600% annual percentage rate (APR), according to Xie\u2019s analysis. The interest rates at Speedy Cash, where Molina borrows money, can reach 460%. (Speedy Cash did not reply to requests for comment.) \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at how much they charge over a week or two weeks, it\u2019s not that much. But if you think about it in the annual sense, then the interest rates are extremely high,\u201d Xie said. The loans are widely seen as predatory, with the average customer earning about $30,000 a year and remaining in debt for an average of five months a year, according to a 2012 Pew Charitable Trusts study. One 2021 study found that lenders disproportionately target Black and Latino communities. Payday loans are restricted or outlawed in 18 states and Washington DC, but many lenders find ways around the laws by offering high-interest loans online or operating on sovereign tribal land. Utility bills are among the most common reasons that people take out payday loans. The 2012 study by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that seven in 10 borrowers use payday loans for recurring expenses like rent and utilities. Another study in 2012 by the Center for Financial Services Innovation found the most common use for short-term loans like payday loans was to cover utility bills. Extreme heat does not affect all communities equally. People who live in urban \u201cheat islands\u201d with fewer trees and parks are at greater risk from heat, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Due to systemic discrimination, like historic redlining, people of color and lower-income residents are more likely to live in heat islands. Molina lives in a heat island. South LA has little tree cover, and bus stops carry ads warning of heatstroke. The largely lower-income area experiences higher rates of heat-related emergency room visits compared to wealthier areas of the city, according to a University of California, Los Angeles, data analysis. Erika Toriz, founder and CEO of Haven Neighborhood Services, a community group in south Los Angeles, said her clients struggle with an impossible choice: endure heat stress and illness, which can be deadly, or take out payday loans to pay for cooling, which can lead to a cycle of debt. Many of her clients put foil on their windows to reflect sunlight or use wet towels to stay cool. Those with air conditioning avoid running it for too long. \u201cFamilies are worried that their electric bill is going to go up, because they can\u2019t afford that. Even going up $25 is a huge difference,\u201d she explained. \u201cFor our clients, it\u2019s like putting a meal for one or two days on their table.\u201d For some workers, heat can affect their ability to earn a living. A 2021 study found that outdoor workers \u2013 who earn a median annual income of $31,000 a year \u2013 risk losing as much as $1,700 in annual income by mid-century as a result of extreme heat. Kristina Dahl, co-author of the study and principal climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: \u201cOne implication of that lost income from extreme heat could be seeking out payday loans, which have huge interest rates and can really catalyse a cycle of debt.\u201d Black and Hispanic workers are disproportionately affected by extreme heat, facing productivity losses 18% greater than non-Hispanic white workers, according to a 2021 report by the Atlantic Council. \u201cClimate change is just pushing them even further toward this financial brink,\u201d Dahl said. Xie noted that hurricanes and wildfires trigger government aid and insurance that can help households handle financial stress, but heatwaves and cold snaps do not. \u201cThose smaller events still have strong effects on household wellbeing,\u201d she said. Utility assistance programs like the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (Liheap) can provide some relief, she said, but many households are either unaware that they exist or do not know how to file claims for assistance. \u201cMaking [this] program more widely available and accessible to low-income households could also be one of the strategies\u201d to help people cope with extreme temperatures, Xie said. Vargas said she wasn\u2019t sure whether her mother qualified for California\u2019s Liheap program because she already receives other forms of government assistance. \u201cA lot of these programs, there\u2019s a lot of red tape,\u201d Vargas said. Karen Lusson, senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Centre, said many states don\u2019t spend enough on low-income energy programs. \u201cThe allocations just don\u2019t cover the need,\u201d she said. Lusson said Xie\u2019s study highlighted the \u201cheat-or-eat conundrum\u201d in which families face difficult choices between paying utility bills or buying groceries and medicine. \u201cWhen you throw in climate change, and the fact that 2023 was the hottest year in the recorded history of the planet, the unaffordability problem can be expected to grow more dire,\u201d she said. Molina is not thinking about the long term \u2013 she\u2019s more focused on her mounting expenses. \u201cIt\u2019s too high: the lights, the gas, even the food,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat can I do? I just thank God I\u2019m living every day.\u201d"

A shieldbug, coaxed from hibernation among last autumn\u2019s fallen leaves and sunbathing on a dandelion, seems to be revelling in it too. It\u2019s a hairy shieldbug, Dolycoris baccarum, about the size of my smallest fingernail, clad in heraldic shield-shaped chitinous body armour, emblazoned in purple and bronze, with black and white banded antennae. A recent arrival from southern counties, it is currently expanding its range northwards, probably in response to climate change. Hairy shieldbugs are well \u2013 perhaps too well \u2013 established in my garden here in the Pennine foothills. In 2019, I noticed the first solitary individual; by last summer there were scores of them, congregating to mate on mullein leaf rosettes, using their syringe-like mouthparts to suck sap from ripe raspberries. I shook the dandelion, and the bug dropped into my collecting tube, waggling its legs in the air like an unhorsed knight in armour. Regaining composure, it produced two drops of greenish cloudy liquid, a last-resort chemical defence against predators. This pungent fluid gives shieldbugs another name: stink bugs. I unscrewed the tube cap and took a sniff, detecting a bouquet reminiscent of boiled cabbage with a whiff of stagnant water from a vase of decaying chrysanthemums. Unpleasant to a human nose, probably repulsive to enemies in the olfactory landscape inhabited by insects. This little shieldbug is the latest invertebrate coloniser in a garden I\u2019ve cultivated for almost four decades, during which it has become home to native speckled wood and holly blue butterflies that are extending their range northwards, and to exotic aliens that include Moroccan and Italian harvestman spiders, Asian harlequin ladybirds and European tree bumblebees. We are all witnesses to climate change now: stay in one place for long enough, watch and get to know it well, and a succession of wildlife climate change refugees and opportunists will surely turn up. Someday, when I\u2019m long gone, someone else will cultivate my little patch of ground, find their raspberries infested with hairy shieldbugs, and maybe assume that they\u2019ve always been here. I\u2019m penning this note so they\u2019ll know when and how they arrived. \u2022 Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"

            "date": "2024-04-07T14:00:06Z",
            "content": "Shortly after Charles Darwin published his magnum opus, The Origin of Species, in 1859 he started reading a little-known 100-year-old work by a wealthy French aristocrat. Its contents were quite a surprise. \u201cWhole pages [of his book] are laughably like mine,\u201d Darwin wrote to a friend. \u201cIt is surprising how candid it makes one to see one\u2019s view in another man\u2019s words.\u201d In later editions of The Origin of Species, Darwin acknowledged Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, as one of the \u201cfew\u201d people who had understood that species change and evolve, before Darwin himself. Now a new book will attempt to shine a light on the French naturalist\u2019s extraordinary achievements and groundbreaking ideas, which date back to the 1740s. \u201cBuffon was one of the very first people to postulate the change of species over time,\u201d said Jason Roberts, author of a new book, Every Living Thing, which will be published next week, on 11 April. \u201cHe did not call it evolution \u2013 that word was coined later \u2013 but he was one of the first people to talk about it and suggest there was some kind of system.\u201d In Histoire Naturelle, a 36-volume book Buffon worked on for 50 years, he also put forward the idea that animals were becoming extinct at a time when most natural historians believed that \u201cGod would never allow any species to ever disappear or arise over time\u201d, according to Roberts. \u201cThe concept of species change and extinction was very controversial.\u201d Similarly, Buffon\u2019s observations about reproduction anticipated the discovery of DNA: \u201cHe suggested there had to be some kind of internal shaping mechanism \u2013 that life exists on an organic cellular level and there has to be some kind of recipe or \u2018internal mould\u2019 that reproduction follows, to assemble the building blocks of cells into a particular kind of organism.\u201d After inheriting a fortune from a distant relative, equivalent to about \u00a328m today, Buffon used some of his wealth to turn a 100-acre park he owned in Burgundy into an \u201cenvironmental laboratory\u201d, where he \u201clet things go wild and then observed what happened\u201d, Roberts said. \u201cHe has actually been described as the world\u2019s first ecologist, because he was the first person to really study a species in its own environment, and not just a specimen of a dead organism.\u201d Buffon observed everything that happened in his park, from the breeding habits of the foxes to the patterns of the birds and the trees they chose to nest in. \u201cHe was the first scientist to study life in its context and make live contextual observations,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cHe would pay huge amounts of money for specimens of live animals so he could see them and interact with them.\u201d Instead of evolution, Buffon used the term \u201cdegeneration\u201d to refer to a natural process \u201coutside the regular reproductive process\u201d that brought about change to a species. The term did not have negative connotations at the time. But Buffon never figured out how this species change actually took place: it took Darwin, and his theory of natural selection, co-developed with Alfred Russel Wallace, to shed light on the process. Even without this key insight, Buffon postulated that new species must have come into existence and changed over time, while some species must have gone extinct. \u201cThat was a very, very radical idea at the time, and Buffon was censured for it by the Sorbonne: he had to write a statement publicly renouncing everything he had written,\u201d said Roberts. Buffon was later formally accused of heresy for implying that Earth was older than the biblical record. \u201cBuffon suspected it was a matter of millions, if not billions, of years,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cHe pioneered the idea of time on a geological scale.\u201d Unlike his contemporary Carl Linnaeus, who believed that nature was static and every species had stayed exactly as God created them, Buffon believed nature was too complex and changeable to be easily categorised. He was even concerned about the impact of human-caused climate change. \u201cBuffon had enemies, because his message \u2013 that nature cannot be conquered, that humans were, in fact, part of nature \u2013 was essentially disconcerting to other people.\u201d Roberts said he quickly realised that the world wasn\u2019t receptive to his ideas. \u201cHe would make a statement like: \u2018For species to change, one must imagine that the earth is millions of years old\u2019, hoping that one day people would be ready to hear that. But then he would have to add a sentence: \u2018But of course, that\u2019s ridiculous speculation. The Bible tells us otherwise.\u2019\u201d Since Buffon had to keep undermining his own observations, it was easy for Victorian naturalists to brush aside his contributions, suggesting \u2013 as Darwin did \u2013 that Buffon\u2019s opinions \u201cfluctuated greatly\u201d. Roberts hopes his book will help to reassert Buffon\u2019s rightful place in history: \u201cThe outrage that greeted Darwin in 1859 is well known,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine if those ideas had been asserted in 1759.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 8 April 2024 to include a reference to Charles Darwin\u2019s fellow naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace."

            "content": "Climate change is causing apparently healthy trees to die after periods of heat and drought. Many may not die immediately but repeated periods of hot weather seem to increase the vulnerability of some species more than others. Researchers studied 20 species of conifers planted 100 years ago in the same place in the Netherlands, taking tree ring samples to see how they did in droughts between 1970 and 2013. From the distance between the rings it is possible to tell how much each species\u2019 growth was affected. After the hot, dry summers from 2018 to 2020 the scientists returned and found that some of the plantation had not just lost growth but been unable to survive at all. Some species had all come through but in others seven out of 10 trees had died. Rather surprisingly it was not the different ability of trees to find water in the soil that caused the deaths but leaf damage. Some pine species renew their needles each year while others keep them for a decade or even longer, something that would normally save the tree energy and effort. But in this case the species that had heat-damaged needles but could replace them quickly survived, while those that did not have that ability gradually died."

            "date": "2024-04-22T11:39:42Z",
            "content": "Julian Medina comes from a long line of fishers in the north of Colombia\u2019s Gulf of Morrosquillo who use small-scale and often traditional methods to catch species such as mackerel, tuna and cojin\u00faa. Medina went into business as a young man but was drawn back to his roots, and ended up leading a fishing organisation. For years he has campaigned against the encroachment of fossil fuel companies, pollution and overfishing, which are destroying the gulf\u2019s delicate ecosystem and people\u2019s livelihoods. He says there have been huge declines in the amount of fish he and others can catch \u2013 70% in the past decade \u2013 leading to widespread hunger in an already poor region. \u201cWe are now getting fish below the minimum size, which are the ones that could have provided us with security in the future.\u201d Medina is angry at the fossil fuel companies that are taking over part of the coast and have caused oil spills, and angry at the authorities that license them and undermine community attempts to restore mangrove forests. He is also deeply concerned about how warming water is bleaching the coral reefs through which his prey swims. \u201cWe see how industrial activity is affecting our entire ecosystem,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we also know that climate change is affecting our environment. It is a struggle and we are trying to make it visible in order to be heard.\u201d Medina will be telling his story this week to a panel of judges in Barbados during the first part of a historic hearing on climate change by the inter-American court of human rights. The inquiry was instigated by Colombia and Chile, which together asked the court to set out what legal responsibilities states have to tackle climate change and to stop it breaching people\u2019s human rights. The detailed request seeks clarity on many issues, including children\u2019s and women\u2019s rights, environmental defenders, and common but differentiated responsibilities \u2013 the idea that all countries have a role to play in tackling climate change but some should bear a bigger burden. As well as mitigating and adapting to climate change, it asks how states should tackle the inevitable loss and damage. Although climate change affects the whole world, the two countries told the court that its effects are not experienced uniformly or fairly. Their request letter warns that people in Chile and Colombia already deal with the daily consequences of the climate emergency, including droughts, floods, landslides and fires. \u201cThese phenomena highlight the need to respond urgently and based on the principles of equity, justice, cooperation and sustainability, with a focus on human rights,\u201d they said. Courts around the world are increasingly making the link between climate justice and human rights. This month, the European court of human rights ruled for the first time that weak government climate policies violated fundamental human rights. But the global south is leading the way. The Costa Rica-based court was set up in 1979 to interpret and apply the American convention on human rights, a treaty ratified by members of the Organization of American States. Twenty states have accepted its jurisdiction, including most Latin American countries and several Caribbean islands. Neither the US nor Canada have done so. It is the third international court tasked with providing an advisory opinion on climate change, alongside the international court of justice and the international tribunal for the law of the aea. Such opinions are highly influential and set the framework for future legal action. However, the inter-American court is the only one focusing on human rights. In a previous opinion it recognised the right to a healthy environment and affirmed that states must protect human rights affected by environmental harm, even if it happens outside their borders. That recognition was enforced in March, when it ruled that Peru had violated the right to a healthy environment of people living in the country\u2019s \u201cmost contaminated town\u201d. \u201cThe inter-American court is generally known and sees itself as a court that is much more willing to innovate with the law and to draw on sources from around the world,\u201d said Sophie Marjanac, the accountable corporations lead at environmental law charity ClientEarth who will be speaking at the Barbados hearing. Unlike the other courts, the inter-American court accepts written submissions from organisations and individuals, and has invited many of these to its oral hearings. The hearing will begin with statements from the governments of Chile, Colombia and Barbados, followed by Mexico and Vanuatu. The court will then hear from UN bodies, legal experts from the Americas and further afield, local and national campaign groups, trade unions and refugee organisations. The eclectic mix of speakers includes Grupo Energ\u00eda Bogot\u00e1, a large regional gas company. One key part of the opinion tackles intergenerational equity, and the court will hear directly from youth people. Jovana Hoschtialek, 18, a teacher and Grenadian climate campaigner, has seen significant changes in her home island. \u201cThe sea is rising, quite a few of our plants are dying and water is becoming more scarce,\u201d she said. \u201cSooner or later the things that I have grown up with, my younger sisters aren\u2019t going to be able to experience.\u201d Hoschitalek is preparing to tell the court about her experiences. \u201cI want to try to tell them how important it is that the future generations can be seen because \u2026 children won\u2019t be able to survive the harsh climate that will come if things don\u2019t take a drastic change.\u201d Trina Chiemi, the founder of youth network Fast Action on Climate to Ensure Intergenerational Justice, hopes the hearing will be an empowering process. \u201cWith the inter-American court we\u2019re able to share our voices directly, and they\u2019re able to look and see the faces of the people that are affected.\u201d The court\u2019s subsequent hearings in the Brazilian cities of Bras\u00edlia and Manaus in May will include many more frontline stories from the climate crisis including people living in \u201csacrifice zones\u201d in Chile, Bolivian women fighting to protect their local water supplies and Indigenous communities. Medina and others are speaking at the hearing with the support of Asociaci\u00f3n Interamericana para la Defensa del Ambiente (Aida), an environmental law organisation that works in Latin America. \u201cA lot of issues that are going to be raised may seem disconnected,\u201d said Marcella Ribeiro, a senior human rights and environment attorney for Aida. \u201cBut what I think is really beautiful [about] hearing from environmental defenders and communities directly is that they can pinpoint where or how these environmental issues connect with climate change. For example, environmental degradation and their ability to adapt.\u201d Once the opinion is published, it will have direct influence on the countries that accept the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Legal experts say it will be an authoritative source on the obligations of states to respond to climate change, potentially boosting action to cut greenhouse gas emissions, supporting adaptation measures and helping establish mechanisms to address loss and damage. Campaigners also hope it will invigorate existing climate lawsuits and petitions, such as those currently stalled at the inter-American commission on human rights (the court\u2019s sister organisation), and say it could form the basis for future domestic or regional climate litigation. It could even be used by countries during arbitration claims in investor-state dispute settlements, many of which are brought by companies in extractive industries.

            "content": "The head of the UN\u2019s atomic watchdog agency has condemned a drone strike on one of six nuclear reactors at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine, saying such attacks \u201csignificantly increase the risk of a major nuclear accident\u201d. In a statement on X, Rafael Grossi confirmed at least three direct hits against the ZNPP main reactor containment structures. \u201cThis cannot happen,\u201d the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said. Grossi said it was the first such attack since November 2022, when he set out five basic principles to avoid a serious nuclear accident with radiological consequences. Russian officials at the plant claimed the site was attacked on Sunday by Ukrainian military drones, including a strike on the dome of the plant\u2019s sixth power unit. Ukraine\u2019s intelligence agency has denied responsibility for the strike. \u201cRussian strikes, including imitation ones, on the territory of the Ukrainian nuclear power plant ... have long been a well known criminal practice of the invaders,\u201d a spokesperson told local media. The Guardian has been unable to verify the claims. According to the plant authorities, there was no critical damage or casualties and radiation levels at the plant were normal after the strikes. Later on Sunday, however, Russian state-owned nuclear agency Rosatom said three people were wounded in the \u201cunprecedented series of drone attacks\u201d, specifically when a drone hit an area close to the site\u2019s canteen. The IAEA said on Sunday that its experts had been informed of the drone strike and that \u201csuch detonation is consistent with IAEA observations\u201d. In a separate statement, the nuclear watchdog confirmed the physical impact of drone attacks at the plant, including at one of its six reactors. One casualty was reported, it said. \u201cDamage at unit 6 has not compromised nuclear safety, but this is a serious incident with potential to undermine integrity of the reactor\u2019s containment system\u201d it added. The power plant has been caught in the crossfire since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in 2022 and seized the facility shortly afterwards. The IAEA has repeatedly expressed alarm about the nuclear power plant, Europe\u2019s largest, amid fears of a potential nuclear catastrophe. Both Ukraine and Russia have regularly accused the other of attacking the plant, which is still close to the front lines. The plant\u2019s six reactors have been shut down for months, but it still needs power and qualified staff to operate crucial cooling systems and other safety features. Also on Sunday, three people were killed when their house was hit by a Russian projectile in the frontline town of Huliaipole in Ukraine\u2019s partly occupied south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said. Later on Sunday, two people were wounded in another shelling of Huliaipole. Separately, three people were wounded in Russian shelling in Ukraine\u2019s north-east Kharkiv region, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov. In Russia, a girl died and four other people were wounded when the debris of a downed Ukrainian drone fell on a car carrying a family of six people in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said."

More updates to come \u2026 Flooding in two more Russian regions deemed \u201cinevitable\u201d by the Kremlin on Sunday. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said that flooding in Russia\u2019s Kurgan and Tyumen was \u201cinevitable\u201d, amid major floods in the Ural Mountain Orenburg region, state news agency TASS reported.

The floods, caused by rising water levels in the Ural River, forced over 4,000 people, including 885 children, to evacuate, the regional government said. State news agency Tass said that a further 2,000 homes were flooded, bringing the total to nearly 6,300 in the region. Russian authorities have opened a criminal case for \u201cnegligence and violation of construction safety rules\u201d over the burst dam, which was built in 2014.

Officials in Orsk reported Sunday that four people had died, but said their deaths were unrelated to the flooding. We have had some more information come through about Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\u2019s visit to China on Monday and Tuesday. Talks between Lavrov and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who extended the invitation to the Russian minister, will consist of bilateral cooperation as well as \u201chot topics\u201d, such as the crisis in Ukraine and the Asia-Pacific, the Russian foreign ministry said. On Saturday, the US warned allies that China has provided geospatial intelligence to Moscow in its war against Ukraine. According to reports, China has provided Russia with satellite imagery for military purposes, as well as microelectronics and machine tools for tanks. China\u2019s foreign ministry has not responded to a request for comment during a holiday weekend. Reuters reported last month that Russian President Vladimir Putin will travel to China in May for talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, in what might be the Kremlin chief\u2019s first overseas trip of his new presidential term. Flooding in Russia\u2019s Orenburg remains \u201ccritical\u201d. The mayor of the Russian city of Orenburg said on Sunday that the situation around flooding in the city remained \u201ccritical\u201d, and that water levels would continue to rise in the coming days, Reuters reports. Russia said on Saturday that it had evacuated more than 4,000 people in the Orenburg region, which lies near the Kazakhstan border, due to flooding after a dam burst. Orsk oil refinery, located in Orenburg, also suspended work on Sunday, Russian news agency cited the plant\u2019s press service as saying. They reported that the suspension of operations was aimed at avoiding ecological risks. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov will make an official visit to China, China\u2019s foreign ministry said on Sunday. Earlier this week, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told journalists in Guangzhou, \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear with China that we see Russia as gaining support from goods that China, Chinese firms are supplying to Russia.\u201d \u201cNeither of us want this to be an issue with our bilateral relationship. So we\u2019re working together,\u201d she added. Sergei Lavrov is expected to visit China on Monday and Tuesday. Three civilians were killed in a Russian attack on the frontline village of Guliaipole, in Ukraine\u2019s southeastern Zaporizhzhia region, on Sunday morning, the local governor has said. \u201cTwo men and a woman died under the rubble of their own house, which was hit by a Russian shell,\u201d Ivan Fedorov said on the Telegram messaging app. Fedorov said one more person was injured. The Guardian could not independently verify the report. Welcome to our continuing live coverage of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. Here\u2019s an overview of the latest news on day 774 to bring you up to speed. Ukraine\u2019s forces destroyed 17 attack drones launched by Russia overnight, the Ukrainian military said on Sunday. \u201cAt night the Russian occupiers attacked Ukraine once again, using 17 attack drones. The Ukrainian air defence forces destroyed all of them,\u201d the Ukrainian General Staff said on Facebook. Earlier, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that Ukraine could run out of air defence missiles if Russia keeps up its intense long-range bombing campaign. More on that story shortly. In other key developments: Zelenskiy also said on Saturday that he hoped that he and Swiss president Viola Amherd would set a date within days for a world peace summit in Switzerland with 80 to 100 countries. Russia has said such a meeting would be pointless if it did not participate. Kyiv has previously proposed a world peace summit but has said Russia would not be invited. A close ally of populist prime minister Robert Fico has defeated a pro-western career diplomat to become Slovakia\u2019s new president. Critics worry Slovakia under Fico will abandon its pro-western course and follow the direction of Hungary under populist prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Thousands have repeatedly taken to the streets across Slovakia recently to rally against Fico\u2019s pro-Russian and other policies. Two Russian missile and drone strikes, one in the early hours of Saturday and a second in the afternoon, killed eight people and wounded at least 10 more people in northeastern Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second largest city, national emergency services and the city\u2019s mayor said on Saturday. Igor Terekhov also said in Telegram post that the attack had targeted Shevchenkivskyi, a northern area of the city, Agence France-Presse reports. Terekhov said Iranian-made drones had carried out the attack, hitting at least nine high-rise buildings, three dormitories and a petrol station. Oleg Synegubov, the region\u2019s governor, said earlier that two men were killed in Shevchenkivskyi. Police confirmed the deaths and said a further eight people were hospitalised \u201cwith blast injuries and shrapnel wounds\u201d. Police added that there were no casualties in a separate attack on Mala Danylivka, a village on Kharkiv\u2019s north-west outskirts. In the eastern region of Donetsk, artillery shelling killed four people in the village of Kurakhivka including a 38-year-old woman and her 16-year-old daughter, and a 25-year-old man in the village of Krasnohorivka was killed, local officials said. Russia on Saturday condemned as a provocation a drone attack on a military facility of pro-Russian separatists in Moldova\u2019s breakaway Transnistria region and called for an investigation. An explosive drone hit a facility belonging to the separatist authority\u2019s defence ministry six km (four miles) from the border with Ukraine, the region\u2019s security ministry said on Friday. Ukrainian forces are still in control of the town of Chasiv Yar in eastern Ukraine despite attempts by Russian troops to break through their defences, commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said. Russia\u2019s RIA news agency on Friday cited an official as saying Russian forces had entered the suburbs of the town, which Moscow sees as an important staging point for Kyiv\u2019s troops. Ukrainian military said the report was untrue, Reuters reported. \u201cChasiv Yar remains under our control, and all enemy attempts to break through to the settlement have failed,\u201d Syrskyi said on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday. On the ground in Ukraine, Russian forces were advancing, and pushing back against them was \u201cdifficult\u201d, said Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. Syrskyi said the situation in the Bakhmut area in the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region was particularly challenging, Reuters reported. He said Russian forces are carrying out offensive operations day and night, using assault groups with the support of armoured vehicles, as well as assaults on foot. Tajikistan\u2019s foreign ministry on Saturday rejected a claim by a top Russian security official that Ukraine\u2019s embassy in the Tajik capital was recruiting mercenaries to fight against Russia. \u201cWe note that this assertion by the Russian official has no basis to it,\u201d Russian news agencies quoted Tajik foreign ministry spokesperson Shokhin Samadi as saying."

            "date": "2024-04-03T05:00:19Z",
            "content": "The Arctic char (or charr), Salvelinus alpinus, has for centuries had a special place in Britain\u2019s largest natural lake, Lake Windermere. Since the ice age, when the glaciers retreated leaving behind a deep cold water lake, the char has lived in its depths. Similar to trout and salmon, the char has always been thought of as a culinary delicacy and for centuries was sold to the wealthier members of British society as a rare dish. Commercial netting was stopped in 1921 and now it is only a specialist angler that will try to lure one on to a hook. There are many other Arctic char populations, and it is thought to be the most northerly freshwater fish. Some are elsewhere in the UK, notably in Scotland\u2019s deep lakes, often isolated so long that they were once thought to be different species. The Windermere char was originally a migratory species, like salmon, but even though they could escape the lake they stay put. They grow slowly and a 10-year-old spawning fish will reach 30cm (1ft). Their existence and their cultural value contributed to Windermere being declared a Unesco world heritage site in 2017. Sadly, however, their future is in doubt. Raw sewage from United Utilities overflows has been flooding into Windermere. If this situation continues, the char habitat may never be the same."

            "content": "Israel has suspended leave for combat units and heightened its air defence command to deal with possible missile or drone attack from Iran following the killing this week in an airstrike of senior Revolutionary Guard commanders in Syria. The Israeli military is also considering reopening shelters in Tel Aviv as a precaution against a possible attack, according to Mehr News Agency. \u201cIn accordance with the situational assessment, it has been decided that leave will be temporarily paused for all IDF (Israel Defense Forces) combat units. The IDF is at war and the deployment of forces is under continuous assessment according to requirements,\u201d the military said in a statement. Iran has vowed revenge after an airstrike destroyed the Iranian consulate in Damascus, killing at least 11 people, including a senior commander in the al-Quds force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said: \u201cWe consider this aggression to have violated all diplomatic norms and international treaties. Benjamin Netanyahu has completely lost his mental balance due to the successive failures in Gaza and his failure to achieve his Zionist goals.\u201d Iran\u2019s ambassador to Syria, Hossein Akbari, said Iran\u2019s response to the strike would be \u201cat the same magnitude and harshness\u201d. Iran\u2019s leaders in Tehran described the targeting of a diplomatic mission late on Monday as unprecedented and promised a harsh response. While Israel has not officially acknowledged its involvement, the incident has the potential to further destabilise the already volatile region. The IDF has also intensified GPS jamming efforts in response to the threat of an Iranian retaliation, causing disruptions to navigation services and impacting daily operations. The use of GPS jamming is an apparent measure meant to ward off guided missiles. Reports indicate that the jamming has expanded to key areas in Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. These measures have raised concerns about potential implications on aviation safety and daily life. Amos Yadlin, a former Israeli intelligence chief, told Reuters that Iran may choose this Friday \u2013 the last in the holy Muslim month of Ramadan and Iran\u2019s Quds (Jerusalem) Day \u2013 to respond to the Damascus strike, either directly or through a proxy. \u201cI will not be surprised if Iran will act tomorrow. Don\u2019t panic. Don\u2019t run to the shelters,\u201d said Yadlin, a senior fellow at the Kennedy School\u2019s Belfer Center at Harvard University, citing Israel\u2019s aerial defence systems. \u201cBe tuned for tomorrow and then, depending on the consequences of the attack, it may escalate,\u201d Yadlin said. On Thursday, Iran repatriated the bodies of seven IRGC members killed in the strike. \u201cThe bodies of the Iran embassy martyrs arrived at Mehrabad airport,\u201d in Tehran, the ISNA news agency reported.

            "date": "2024-04-19T15:28:40Z",
            "content": "The central Iranian city of Isfahan is home to a number of important military facilities, including nuclear facilities, a major airbase and factories associated with Iranian drone and other military production. Initial reports by Iran\u2019s Fars news agency from the Friday morning Israeli attacks centred on \u201cthree explosions\u201d heard near Qahjavarestan, close to Isfahan airport and the Shekari army airbase, while Iran\u2019s space agency spokesperson Hossein Dalirian said \u201cseveral\u201d drones had been \u201csuccessfully shot down\u201d. Iranian officials said that its nuclear facilities \u201cwere secure\u201d. The Natanz uranium enrichment plant, Iran\u2019s best known nuclear facility is located in the wider province, while a uranium conversion is carried in the city\u2019s south-eastern Zardanjan area. Video from the Tasnim news agency from Zardanjan showed two different anti-aircraft gun positions, and details of the video corresponded with known features of the Isfahan uranium conversion facility. \u201cAt 4.45, we heard gunshots. There was nothing going on,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cIt was the air defence, these guys that you\u2019re watching, and over there too.\u201d The facility at Isfahan, which began construction in 1999, operates three small Chinese-supplied research reactors, as well as handling fuel production and other activities for Iran\u2019s civilian nuclear programme. The site appears to have been hit by an explosion in November 2011. Isfahan is also home to a major Iranian airbase which has held Iran\u2019s ageing fleet of American-made F-14 Tomcats \u2013 bought before the 1979 Islamic revolution. Some initial speculation suggested that a radar facility at the base may have been the intended target of an attack. Equally important are Iran\u2019s weapons production facilities in and around the city. Early last year an attack, blamed on Israel, was launched on what was reportedly an advanced weapons production facility in the city, which like the current claimed strike involved three drones. As in the current attack there were wildly conflicting accounts from Iranian officials, who claimed that two drones had been shot down and another had inflicted only minor damage to the factory\u2019s roof."

            "title": "Rising unemployment points to worrying signs for UK economy",
            "date": "2024-04-16T11:02:12Z",
            "content": "The government has patted itself on the back in recent years for presiding over a period of low unemployment, but underneath the latest headline figures there are concerning trends. First among the worrying signs is an increase in the number of working age people leaving the labour market because of ill-health, who need to take on caring responsibilities or retire early. In February, the UK economic inactivity rate for those aged 16 to 64 years was 22.2%, which means about 275,000 more people than a year ago. In 2022, there was optimism that a sharp rise in the inactivity rate during the three Covid-19 lockdowns was coming down quickly and normality was being restored to the jobs market. Those who were ill from Covid and its longer-term effects were finding their way back to the workforce and early retirement, which had proved exceptionally popular among the over-55s, was losing its allure. That trend reversed last year, leaving ministers to scratch their heads about the causes. Experts in the employment field were in no doubt that the government\u2019s battle with NHS unions and delays to bringing down waiting lists played a big part. Benefit cuts that have reduced payments to disabled people and a mental health service in crisis have also been factors. Then there is the rise of childcare costs and the increasing price of residential care for older and disabled people that has forced many families to step into the breach, accepting they will work fewer paid hours themselves. Tony Wilson, the director of the Institute for Employment Studies, was one of many to blame the government\u2019s lacklustre efforts to improve mental health support, and slow response to the rise of school leavers not in education, training or work. The number of apprenticeship places for young people is low even as childcare businesses struggle to recruit staff. Charlie McCurdy, an economist at the Resolution Foundation, said rising redundancies and falling job levels were signs of a stagnant economy, \u201cwhile rising inactivity and long-term sickness suggest there are wider issues with the health of our workforce\u201d. He said: \u201cTackling rising inactivity \u2013 and its impact on the public finances, the benefits system, and people\u2019s wider health and wellbeing \u2013 is one of the biggest economic challenges facing both this government, and whoever wins the next election.\u201d Ministers can comfort themselves that the immediate bill from a weak labour market is low. The claimant count for March increased by 10,900 on the month and is up by 57,400 on the year to 1.583 million. By this measure, unemployment was considered to be resilient. After all, the number of people signing on for unemployment benefits was relatively small when set against a long period of economic stagnation that culminated in recession in the second half of 2023. However, a fall of 156,000 in the number of people in employment in the last quarter to the end of February on the previous one, gives a clearer sign that all is not well. Add the wider cost to society from lost economic growth, careers forgone by people needing to care for loved ones and growing ill-health, and the situation is worse than it looks at first glance."

            "date": "2024-04-16T15:20:53Z",
            "content": "The number of people out of work rose by more than expected in February, raising concerns that employers are beginning to lay off staff in response to high interest rates. The Office for National Statistics said the unemployment rate increased to 4.2% in February from 3.9%, well above the 4% expected by City economists. Analysts said the cooling effects of higher interest rates were leading to more redundancies and discouraging employers from hiring staff. Despite rising unemployment, regular pay growth excluding bonuses was stronger than expected at 6% in the three months to February, underlining the dilemma facing the Bank of England over when to start cutting interest rates. Pay growth of 6% was down from 6.1%, but stronger than the 5.8% expected by economists polled by Reuters. Total pay growth, which includes bonuses, was unchanged at 5.6%. Yael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG UK, said that overall the latest ONS data suggested the Bank would be on track for a summer cut in interest rates. \u201cThe slight easing in regular pay growth will bring some comfort for the Bank of England which has relied on the pay data as a key gauge of domestic inflationary pressure,\u201d she added. \u201cMoreover, the rise in unemployment rate paints a picture of a less tight labour market. The exact timing of the first rate cut will be a hot debate for the monetary policy committee in the coming months.\u201d The hospitality sector handed workers an average 8.4% pay raise and City workers secured an 8.1% increase. When falling headline inflation rates were taken into account, real wages rose at the fastest pace in two and a half years. Real total pay growth adjusted for consumer price inflation was 1.8%, while real regular pay grew by 2.1% \u2013 both were last higher in July to September 2021. Much of the boost to wages in low-paid sectors such as hospitality came from April\u2019s 9.8% rise in the national minimum wage to \u00a311.44 an hour. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research said the increase \u201cmay keep wage growth elevated\u201d for much of the year. \u201cAlthough this is good news for employees the persistence of high wage growth together with the minimum wage hike means inflation may be stickier than previously thought, leading the Bank of England to remain cautious against an early rate cut,\u201d the thinktank said. Some of the highest-paying sectors were among those to see the biggest falls in pay growth. Employees in professional, scientific and communications roles were at the bottom of the pay league, after an average median salary rise of 3% in the year to February. IT workers had an average 4% pay rise over the same period. The inactivity rate, which measures the proportion of people aged 16 to 64 who are not working and not seeking or available to work, also increased in February as workers continued to leave the jobs market due to ill-health. Bank of England officials have said the rising inactivity rate is a worry as it reduces the workforce and forces employers to pay higher wages, pushing up costs and inflation. There are about 850,000 additional jobless working-age people than before the pandemic began because they are no longer seeking roles or are unable to start. Economists believe the rise was driven primarily by higher levels of long-term sickness among younger and older workers. \u201cToday\u2019s jobs figures are surprisingly poor, with a steep fall in employment and a sharp rise in those out of work, including an unexpected rise in unemployment,\u201d Tony Wilson, the director at the Institute for Employment Studies, said. \u201cHowever, most concerning is the rise in economic inactivity, which is the measure of those not in work but not looking for work, which is even higher now than it was in the depths of the pandemic.\u201d Ben Harrison, the director of the Work Foundation at Lancaster University, said the UK workforce was \u201csicker and poorer\u201d, and \u201can international outlier\u201d. A record 2.82 million people are economically inactive due to long-term sickness. Between December 2019 and February 2020 717,000 people had become economically inactive due to ill health, Harrrison said, \u201cand the tide is not turning\u201d."

            "content": "Australia\u2019s economy shed 6,600 jobs last month as employers responded to weak demand by trimming staff numbers. The unemployment rate in March was 3.8%, the Australian Bureau of Statistics announced on Thursday, rising from February\u2019s 3.7%. A total of 27,900 full-time jobs were added in March, but the economy shed 34,500 part-time roles. The net 6,600 job loss compared with a gain of 10,000 positions economists had tipped. This tally has been volatile in recent months, including a surprising 116,500 leap in employment in February. The participation rate dropped 0.1 percentage points to 66.6%, while total hours worked edged 1m higher to 1.93bn. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cThe labour market remained relatively tight in March, with an employment-to-population ratio and participation rate still close to their record highs in November 2023,\u201d said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labour statistics at the ABS. \u201cWhile they have both fallen by 0.4 percentage points since then, they continue to be much higher than their pre-pandemic levels.\u201d Both the Reserve Bank of Australia and Treasury had predicted the unemployment rate would rise modestly as the effect of 13 official interest rate rises is squeezing demand in the economy. The organisations expect the jobless rate to reach about 4.3% by June. Australia\u2019s labour market has been strong since the rebound from the Covid pandemic. Unemployment touched 3.4% in November 2022, the lowest since the 1970s. Prior to the release of the labour force figures, investors were betting there was only a minimal chance the RBA would use its next board meeting on 6-7 May to cut the cash rate. Expectations for the timing of the first rate reduction has lately pushed out into next year, with a 25 basis-point cut now only fully priced in by March. Markets barely budged on the news, indicating there were few surprises. The dollar was hovering above the 64.3 US-cent mark, with stocks holding on to most of their gains of just under 0.5% for the day. Among the states, most of the big markets saw the jobless rate tick higher last month. In New South Wales the unemployment rate rose to 3.8% from 3.6% in February, while both Queensland\u2019s and Victoria\u2019s rose to 4.1% from 3.9%. South Australia\u2019s jobless rate jumped to 3.9% from a nation-leading 3.2% in February, while Tasmania clocked the best improvement. Its March unemployment rate was 3.8%, down from 4.5%. The ACT returned to the top of the pile. Its jobless rate sank to 2.9% from 4.2% in February. The national seasonally adjusted underemployment rate fell 0.1 percentage points to 6.5%, the ABS said. While that rate has picked up 0.2 percentage points since March a year ago, it remained 2.3 percentage points lower than the pre-pandemic level of March 2020. The underutilisation rate, which combines the unemployment and underemployment rates, remained at 10.3%. The ABS said the tally was half a percentage point higher than March 2023 and 3.6 percentage points lower than three years earlier. Warren Hogan, chief economist at Judo Bank, said the March figures consolidated the previous month\u2019s big jobs gain. \u201cThe economy is picking up again after the consumer-led slowdown last year,\u201d Hogan said, adding that \u201cwe look like we are wandering off the narrow path\u201d set by the RBA. \u201c[That\u2019s] great news for economic activity and employment but not so great for interest rates,\u201d he said. KPMG economist Michael Malakellis said the labour data won\u2019t \u201cease the RBA\u2019s ongoing concerns about excess demand in the economy and labour market\u201d. \u201cThe unemployment rate remains low and the labour market is displaying resilience,\u201d he said. The RBA\u2019s monthly bulletin, also released on Thursday, included a paper from its own economists that examined whether the economy was near \u201cfull employment\u201d. \u201cWe cannot directly observe the level of full employment, but we know it varies over time due to structural changes in the labour market,\u201d they said. At least on a range of historical measures, the current labour market remains tight. Still, \u201csimply looking at the current level of indicators relative to history can be misleading and there may also be developments that models do not fully capture\u201d, they cautioned."

            "title": "Poverty experts tell Labor jobseeker payments should be lifted to 90% of age pension",
            "date": "2024-04-26T04:32:49Z",
            "content": "Jobseeker payments should be raised to 90% of the age pension and indexed to prevent people going \u201cwithout life\u2019s essentials\u201d, the government\u2019s poverty experts say. The Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee released its pre-budget report on Friday, warning that jobseeker and other working-age payments were still \u201ctoo low\u201d despite last year\u2019s $40 increase in the base rate. The Australian Council of Social Services seized on the report, arguing that raising jobseeker to 90% of the pension rate ($72 a day) would ensure \u201cpeople can live with dignity\u201d. The Albanese government has promised further cost-of-living relief in the budget, beyond its revamp of the stage three tax cuts, but has played down expectations of changes to welfare. The EIAC report found that increasing the jobseeker base rate reduced the gap with the age pension \u201cfrom around $362 per fortnight to $339 per fortnight, a reduction of 6.4%\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But \u201cpeople receiving [jobseeker] payments told the committee that they regularly go without life\u2019s essentials because they simply cannot afford them,\u201d it said. The government should at least \u201ccommit to a timeframe for the full increases of jobseeker and related payments to be implemented, if increases are to be staged\u201d, it said. The inadequacy of jobseeker was \u201cin part the result of unsatisfactory indexation arrangements over many years\u201d, as the benefit is increased in line with inflation. \u201cWithout change to indexation arrangements, the living standards of recipients of these payments will continue to fall,\u201d it said, suggesting indexation could be improved by considering how jobseeker compares with wage growth. The EIAC also called for an increase in commonwealth rent assistance, finding that indexation had \u201cnot kept pace with the spiralling cost of rents, especially in a housing market with a declining proportion of social housing\u201d. The report called for comprehensive employment services reform, including a full redesign of mutual obligations and an \u201curgent need to remove automated payments suspensions\u201d. It found the current system was \u201cnot fit for purpose and is causing harm\u201d. The EIAC called to abolish the activity test for the childcare subsidy to guarantee all children access to a minimum three days of high quality early childhood education and care, echoing calls from the women\u2019s economic equality taskforce. Earlier in April Guardian Australia exclusively revealed the government will lift early childhood educators\u2019 wages as part of the May budget, but it is unclear whether it will agree to requests to remove the activity test. In January, the government announced changes to stage-three, doubling income tax relief for median income earners and guaranteeing that taxpayers earning less than $45,000, who were due to miss out, would receive a tax cut. Crossbench senators and the social services sector argued the changes did nothing for those earning below the tax-free threshold of $18,200 or most recipients of government payments. On 22 April, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said there will be cost of living relief in the budget but \u201cthe centrepiece of that, overwhelmingly the biggest part of that, will be a tax cut for every taxpayer to help with the cost of living\u201d. \u201cBut we are considering additional help on top of that and if we can afford that, if it\u2019s affordable, if it\u2019s responsible, if it\u2019s meaningful and it takes some of the edge off inflation rather than add to the inflation problem, then that is attractive to us,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra. The EIAC found that \u201cany negative effect on incentives to work due to an increase in the jobseeker payment is likely to be small\u201d. \u201cFor people facing economic exclusion, some literature suggests that higher income support payments may improve the capacity to search for and accept employment.\u201d Acoss chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said more than one million people on jobseeker and related payment are \u201cbarely surviving on deeply inadequate income support\u201d. \u201cPeople receiving these payments are eating one meal a day, skipping essential medication and foregoing cooling or heating in a desperate bid to keep a roof over their heads,\u201d she said. Independent senator David Pocock said the EIAC report shows that \u201cwe have a social safety net that is not keeping people safe\u201d. \u201cThe government talks a lot about not leaving anyone behind \u2013 this report \u2026 gives them a blueprint to achieve this,\u201d he said."

            "content": "The US workforce added 303,000 jobs last month, far more than expected and the 39th straight month of job gains in the US. The unemployment rate dipped to 3.8%. Joe Biden hailed the report as \u201ca milestone in America\u2019s comeback\u201d. \u201cThree years ago, I inherited an economy on the brink. With today\u2019s report of 303,000 new jobs in March, we have passed the milestone of 15m jobs created since I took office. That\u2019s 15 million more people who have the dignity and respect that comes with a paycheck,\u201d he said. Economists had expected the US to add 192,000 jobs for the month. Hiring has remained surprisingly strong despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s attempts to cool inflation by raising interest rates. Over the last 16 months, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rates from near zero to over 5%. Hikes have been paused recently and the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said in March that the central bank would cut rates in response to a perceived weakness in the jobs market. The next rate decision is in May. Inflation has cooled as rates have risen. The annual rate of price rises was 3.2% in February, down from a high of over 9% in June 2022. And to the surprise of many economists hiring has remained robust. Unemployment has now been below 4% for two years, the longest such streak in decades and down from 6.7% when Biden took office. Healthcare, government and construction led the gains and the labor department reported that employment in leisure and hospitality returned to pre-pandemic levels in February. Wages rose by 0.3% from the previous month and were up 4.1% over the year, the smallest gain since June 2021. While the report was far stronger than expected, it once again highlighted the racial disparities in the US jobs market. The Black unemployment rate rose 0.8% to 6.4%, its highest level since August 2022. Rates for Asians (2.5%) and Hispanics (4.5%) decreased while White unemployment was unchanged at 3.4%. The report is likely to bolster the Fed\u2019s reluctance to begin cutting rates soon. \u201cReducing rates too soon or too much could result in a reversal in the progress we\u2019ve seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2%,\u201d Powell said this week at a business conference at Stanford. \u201cBut easing policy too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.\u201d Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the \u201cblockbuster\u201d report \u201csupports the Fed\u2019s position that the resilience of the economy means it can take its time with rate cuts, which might now not begin until the second half of this year\u201d. In February 2024, non-farm employment in the US increased by a revised 270,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate rising to 3.9% from 3.7% the month prior. On Wednesday ADP, the country\u2019s largest private payroll company, said US businesses added 184,000 new positions in March, the largest rise since July last year."

            "content": "Bonobos are not quite the peace-loving primates they have long been considered, researchers say, after finding that males show more aggression towards each other than chimpanzees. Bonobos and chimpanzees are humans\u2019 closing living relatives. While chimpanzees are known to show aggression against each other \u2013 sometimes to the point of death \u2013 bonobos have long been thought to live more harmoniously, with no known killings. The difference has led to the theory that natural selection works against aggression in male bonobos. Now research has turned the idea on its head, revealing that bonobos show higher rates of male-on-male aggression than chimpanzees \u2013 even when researchers looked specifically at cases where the males came to blows. \u201cIt\u2019s a species with such complex behaviour that just limiting the species to being a hippy, for this study it\u2019s not going to work. It\u2019s just too simplistic,\u201d said Dr Maud Mouginot of Boston University, who is first author of the research. \u201cI think what we know now is that bonobos and chimpanzees use aggression and they use it in different ways. And they have different strategies around it,\u201d she said, adding that an interesting area to explore now was why and when these different strategies evolved. Writing in the journal Current Biology, Mouginot and colleagues describe how they followed 12 male bonobos across three communities at the Kokolopori Bonobo Reserve in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and 14 male chimpanzees across two communities at Gombe national park in Tanzania. Each male was individually followed by the researchers during its waking hours, during which its interactions with other members of its species were recorded, including aggressive physical contact, and other aggressive actions such as charging and chasing. Overall, the team recorded 521 aggressive interactions involving tracked bonobos over 2,047 hours, and 654 aggressive interactions among the identified chimpanzees over 7,309 hours. The team say that despite previous studies finding chimpanzees show more severe aggression \u2013 such as killings, infanticide and sexual coercion \u2013 the results reveal aggressive acts between males were 2.8 times more frequent in bonobos than in chimpanzees, with acts involving physical contact specifically found to be 3.0 times more frequent. For both species, more aggressive males had greater success in mating with females. Yet, while not quite the model of gentlemanly chivalry, male bonobos treated females differently to chimpanzees: the team found male-on-female aggression was less common, and female-on-male aggression more common, in the former than the latter \u2013 something the team put down to female bonobos often outranking males in the social group. \u201cWe know from the literature that, for example, male and female [bonobos] form a close association \u2026 and we do not observe that in chimpanzees,\u201d said Mouginot, noting that humans, too, form such associations. The researchers add that while only 1% of aggressive acts among male bonobos involved the primates teaming up, the figure was 13% in chimpanzees \u2013 a finding that may explain the lower frequency of aggression in chimpanzees. \u201cIt\u2019s just more risky because of course if you have several individuals against you, you might be completely beat up,\u201d Mouginot said."

            "date": "2024-04-20T18:00:33Z",
            "content": "An interesting history lesson this week. We\u2019re all used to stories about the inbreeding of monarchies across early modern Europe. Austria\u2019s Habsburgs led the way, marrying family members off left, right and centre as a diplomatic strategy. Then Queen Victoria took things to new levels \u2013 her descendants ruled not just the UK, but Germany and Russia, as the 20th century dawned. It\u2019s easy to scoff at the inbreeding involved, but hold off. Royal families hooking up with each other might not have been good for their gene pool, but it had a beneficial side effect: fewer wars. So argues a new study examining the monarchies of Europe between 1495 to 1918, mapping the dynastic links, and conflicts, between them. The researchers show that when a kinship tie between monarchs ends, the chance of war increased significantly. For example, when two monarchs are linked via married children and that tie dissolves there is a 9.5 percentage point increase in the annual chance of conflict between their nations. The authors argue this is because \u201ckinship ties between rulers lower negotiation costs and increase the peace dividend, increasing the likelihood of diplomatic resolutions to potential conflicts\u201d. Over those 400 years or so, the percentage of European monarchs that had family ties increased threefold. The authors argue this contributed to the dramatic decrease in the number of wars \u2013 and, in particular, the 50% drop post-1800. Nearly 45% of that decline can be attributed to greater ties between rulers, it\u2019s suggested. So next time the monarchists among you hear people scoffing at the cost of a royal wedding, you can remind them of something: peace is priceless. \u2022 Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation and author of Great Britain?

            "content": "A taste of the drama and beauty of this summer\u2019s Paris Olympics has unfolded in the foothills of Greece with the lighting of the flame that will illuminate the world\u2019s biggest sports event. In a ceremony held amid the ruins of ancient Olympia, the birthplace of the Games 2,800 years ago, the flame was kindled by performers dressed as priestesses, though this year because of weather conditions the torch was not ignited as usual in a parabolic mirror \u2013 which focuses the sun\u2019s rays \u2013 but from a flame lit during a rehearsal. Emerging from the ruins, where she had invoked Apollo, the Greek sun god, for light and peace \u201cfor all peoples of the world\u201d, the actor playing the role of high priestess then handed the flame to the first of hundreds of torchbearers who will carry it on an 11-day journey around Greece. This year, that honour fell to the country\u2019s Olympic gold medallist and rowing champion Stefanos Douskos, who glanced up at the silver torch to ensure it was blazing before taking the first steps of the more than 3,100-mile relay. The flame will be handed over to the organisers of the 33rd Olympiad in Athens on 26 April before making its way on the Belem \u2013 a French three-masted sailing ship built in 1896, the year of the first modern Games \u2013 to Marseille and then Paris for the opening of the Games on 26 July. With war raging in Europe and the Middle East, the ceremony was also infused with something else: a desire for the spirit of truce that the ancients held dear during the original Olympic Games. Giving voice to that desire, the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, told France 2 TV from ancient Olympia: \u201cThis torch is a message of peace, a message of friendship between peoples, which is all the stronger at a time when the world is in such bad shape.\u201d As such, she said, the Olympic flame would pass by the site of the 2015 Islamist attack on the Bataclan concert hall and the Shoah [Holocaust] Memorial when it made its way through the French capital in July. Paris city hall, which is hosting the flame on 14 July, when France celebrates Bastille Day, would stay open all night so that \u201cvisitors and Parisians can see this symbol of fraternal transmission across the planet\u201d, she added. Addressing the Olympic ceremony, French organisers highlighted the equality of this summer\u2019s Games: with full gender parity there will, for the first time, be as many female as male athletes contesting. Paris 2024 will also include competitive breakdancing, an urban sport that originated in the hip-hop culture of 1970s block parties in the US."

Chris Black, who recently returned after five and a half weeks in the Palestinian territory, said the most shocking moment came during a mission to a hospital. \u201cIt was the first time I went to the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis. We were waiting there for the green light to leave and return to Rafah. There was a woman there holding a child. She kept asking: \u2018Are we safe here?\u2019 Asking over and over again. She\u2019s in a hospital that is a protected place under international humanitarian law. I wanted to say: \u2018Yes, you should be safe.\u2019\u201d But Black couldn\u2019t. \u201cI won\u2019t forget that,\u201d he said. Ruba Farah (far left), a field security officer with the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), talks with displaced families living in and around Nasser hospital in Khan Younis The assignment had a profound impact on Black. \u201cI\u2019ve been working in the humanitarian field for 30 years \u2013 conflicts, health emergencies and disasters. But this felt like a life-changing experience. If you talk to any humanitarian worker in Gaza at the moment, they will say the same. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to compare emergencies but this has taken to another level. I don\u2019t usually cry but don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever cried so much on a mission. We were staying in Rafah where there are incredible numbers of people and everyone you meet has a story of trauma, loss and multiple displacement. But it was when you left to travel elsewhere that you really see the destruction. I found myself doing stuff you don\u2019t usually do as comms person, helping transfer people from ambulances. But I wanted to help.\u201d The conditions that Black and his colleagues saw in the Gaza hospitals they visited were horrific, including at the besieged al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis. Clockwise from top left: Dr Sara al-Saqqa, of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), at a checkpoint on mission to Khan Younis to transfer patients from al-Amal hospital. A patient in front of al-Amal hospital. The hospital\u2019s car park, full of destroyed ambulances and civilian vehicles. And a child moving food from a building next to al-Amal hospital. \u201cI was on two missions to al-Amal. The first was to go and meet the hospital director to see their needs and how we could best help. What I remember most was the destruction coming into the facility. Coming through Khan Younis there was utter devastation. You didn\u2019t see many people. When we got to the hospital perimeter it was just debris and smashed-up cars. \u201cThe health workers from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society hadn\u2019t left the building in over a month. We were talking to them in the parking lot and they hadn\u2019t even been in the parking lot in a month. It was a sunny day and they said they hadn\u2019t seen sun in weeks. They couldn\u2019t go to the top floors of the hospital because of the snipers and shelling. \u201cJust imagine the courage to stay there and stick it out with the patients and their families. Because we were there they took advantage of the opportunity to go to the building next door to get food they had not been able to reach for a month.\u201d A Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) paramedic carries a child as his mother is transferred from Nasser hospital to a field hospital in Rafah for further treatment At the Nasser hospital, also in Khan Younis, the WHO team found similar scenes of destruction. \u201cI first visited two weeks before it was besieged. Even then it was overflowing with people but it was kind of working. It had a little bakery,\u201d Black said. \u201cThe next time, a fortnight later, after it had been under siege, it was just a nightmare, full of debris and sewage, with no electricity. People had been there for two weeks with little water and food, barely surviving. We went with the director to refer the last patients from the ICU. He hadn\u2019t been able to get to that building for two weeks. He was seeing the staff there for the first time in that period, saying: \u2018I\u2019m so glad see you.\u2019\u201d Left: a PRCS ambulance full of patients being transferred to other health facilities in Rafah. Right: a patient leaves an International Medical Corps field hospital after being stabilised for further medical attention at a hospital in Rafah. In Rafah, nowhere felt safe, he said. \u201cYou sense it\u2019s one of the most densely populated places world. People are living everywhere. On the streets, in tents, living in cars, houses with 30-40 people living them, thousands in every Unrwa shelter. There\u2019s a stench of sewage, tents on roofs. Every inch of space is occupied. Everyone exhausted. \u201cAnd nowhere is safe, really. Everyone asks the same question. Should we stay here or should we try and go somewhere else?\u201d Left: Dr Sara al-Saqqa, of OCHA, talks with a family of displaced people who are seeking medical help at a M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res medical point near al-Mawasi camp. Right: food is distributed to children collecting it for their families. Then there is the desperation driven by growing hunger. \u201cI was there for the first airdrops [by the Jordanian air force]. Most of it fell into the sea. All aid is welcome but in the end it makes more sense to use the roads. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget getting stuck near a checkpoint on our first mission to bring food to the Nasser hospital. We were waiting in an area before the checkpoint, waiting for the green light to go ahead, waiting on coastal road as another convoy was being looted. As we waited a crowd was gathering. Dr Ahmed, our team leader, was negotiating with the crowd, saying it\u2019s food for the hospital. Just talking for 90 minutes until they just started taking the bags of food and then within minutes the food from two trucks had been taken.\u201d People take food from an early morning convoy heading to Nasser hospital in Khan Younis. There were moments, too, of a dissonant normality that Black said served only to remind him of how abnormal the situation in Gaza was. \u201cWhile I was there I would see kids more and more flying kites. The children are not in school and in the evenings when there\u2019s a breeze and sun\u2019s setting all you see is kites come up from camps and from the city. Like a little bit of peace up in the sky. It was just inspiring how kids just want to play. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the thing. There\u2019s just an overwhelming need for peace. Everyone says it. We don\u2019t need peace for a day or a few days. We need a proper peace and to access basic commodities like food and sanitation and access to health. It\u2019s as simple as that. As simple as peace.\u201d"

            "content": "Two years ago in Madrid, I watched Jeremy Corbyn launch a pan-European campaign to end arms supplies to Ukraine. As he did so, a friend in the Ukrainian army sent me a photo of the machine gun that he\u2019d been issued with: it was made in 1944. If the west had not poured billions of pounds worth of arms and ammunition into Ukraine, its people would have been massacred and enslaved. So forgive me if I describe Mr Corbyn\u2019s call for \u201cpeace\u201d as a meaningless abstraction (Our leaders seem determined to give war a chance. Their thirst for conflict endangers us all, 23 April). The only peace Vladimir Putin is offering the Ukrainian people is that of the grave and, by campaigning to deprive them of weapons, Mr Corbyn is not helping. I share his dismay at the failure of western leaders to hold Israel in check, and to hold its army to account for breaches of the laws of war. But the picture he paints, of a western political class convinced that \u201cwar is the only option\u201d, is false. De-escalation \u2013 in Ukraine, in Gaza, in the Red Sea and with Iran \u2013 has been the watchword in western diplomacy since 2022. It has failed because, try as we might to separate these conflicts and de-escalate them, an axis of anti-western totalitarian powers is determined to do the opposite. When Mr Corbyn blames the west for \u201cpaving a path to escalation\u201d by bombing Yemen, he ignores the fact that the Houthi rebels began the escalation by firing on civilian ships, and that our own Royal Navy is acting entirely within international law by defending them, and the working-class seafarers aboard them. The world\u2019s descent into warfare and inter-ethnic violence is truly terrifying. But when faced with aggression, either from Putin, the Houthis, Hamas, Hezbollah or Iran, abstractions are not enough. The Labour tradition I share with Mr Corbyn is founded on an heroic switch, in 1936-37, from pacifism to anti-fascism, and from disarmament to rearmament. Then, as now, abstract calls for peace served as useful cover for those who wanted to appease dictators. Mr Corbyn should emulate his former Labour colleagues in parliament; support arms for Ukraine and support the Royal Navy as it defends civilian shipping in the Red Sea.

            "title": "Ratings agency downgrades China debt outlook over economic uncertainty",
            "date": "2024-04-10T08:04:53Z",
            "content": "Fitch has downgraded the outlook on China\u2019s debt as it warned of increased risks to the economy while the country moves away from its reliance on growth from the property sector. On Wednesday the US-based agency said it had revised China\u2019s sovereign credit rating from stable to negative, saying this reflected the \u201cincreasing risks to China\u2019s public finance outlook\u201d as the country \u201ccontends with more uncertain economic prospects\u201d. The downgrade comes amid a prolonged crisis in the country\u2019s property sector that has been running since 2021, when a regulatory crackdown on debt-fuelled construction triggered a liquidity squeeze. The huge Chinese property company Evergrande was ordered to go into liquidation earlier this year, while last week the rival crisis-hit developer Country Garden suspended trade in its shares in Hong Kong after delaying the publication of its annual financial results. Beijing has responded with moves to address the issues and recently announced a series of targeted measures to move growth to other parts of the economy. This has included steps to help other sectors, including the issuance of billions of dollars in sovereign bonds, aimed at boosting infrastructure spending and spurring consumption. Fitch said that the country\u2019s economic prospects were uncertain because of this transition away from \u201cproperty-reliant growth\u201d, to what the government views as a more \u201csustainable growth model\u201d. It said: \u201cWide fiscal deficits and rising government debt in recent years have eroded fiscal buffers from a ratings perspective.\u201d The agency added that while the Chinese government\u2019s fiscal policy was likely to play an important role in driving growth in the coming years, it could also keep debt on a \u201csteady upward trend\u201d. Fitch forecasts that the general government deficit will rise to 7.1% of gross domestic product in 2024, from 5.8% in 2023. While it lowered its outlook from \u201cstable\u201d, indicating a downgrade is possible over the medium term, the agency affirmed China\u2019s issuer default rating at A+. The Chinese government said the decision was \u201cregrettable\u201d and said the ratings methodology had \u201cfailed to effectively reflect the positive effects of China\u2019s fiscal policies on boosting economic growth\u201d. Beijing last month set a goal of 5% growth for the world\u2019s second biggest economy in 2024. Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING, said China needed to strike a careful balancing act. \u201cFiscal support in our view is important in order to avoid falling \u2026 into a negative feedback loop of weak confidence, falling asset prices, and slower economic growth. This will cause government debt levels to rise in the near term,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, long-term fiscal consolidation efforts remain important. In China\u2019s case, finding a viable alternative for land sales is an important step to take in the medium term, but the obvious solutions to this \u2013 like increasing other taxes \u2013 are unpalatable.\u201d Dan Wang, the chief economist of Hang Seng Bank China, said Fitch\u2019s move reflected \u201cfundamental concern\u201d over China\u2019s fiscal health and its ability to drive long-term growth. Gary Ng, an Asia-Pacific senior economist at Natixis, stressed that the downgrade did not mean China would default any time soon, adding: \u201cFitch\u2019s outlook revision reflects the more challenging situation in China\u2019s public finance regarding the double whammy of decelerating growth and more debt.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-28T06:00:04Z",
            "content": "Now, let me get this straight. We have a fissiparous, Brexit-supporting government, many of whose MPs are stepping down, convinced that their party is heading for its wilderness years. Correspondingly, we have a Labour opposition that is riding high in the polls, led by Keir Starmer, who \u2013 unlike his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 played a noble part in the remain campaign and argued passionately for a second referendum. Proponents of a second referendum hoped that the country would acknowledge its historic mistake, and return to the European Union it should never have left. I was one of them. We failed. Since that failure, what we were worried would manifest itself has indeed manifested itself. Brexit is an economic disaster, with the Office for Budget Responsibility and National Institute of Social and Economic Research estimating the hit to the nation\u2019s GDP at anything between 4% and 6%. There are daily reports now of the bureaucratic disruption at customs to what was once the ordinary course of business for small and medium-sized firms. Exports and imports alike are affected. There are mounting supply chain shortages; costs are rising as a direct result of Brexit, with more disruption to come. Farmers who voted for Brexit now regret not having been more careful about what they wished for. As for those famous trade deals, promised as substitutes for deals with our nearest and largest market, they have been replaced by \u2013 er, well, let\u2019s face it, they have not been replaced. It\u2019s pathetic: a national example of self-harm that makes us an international laughing stock. But the disaster is not just about business, trade and the economy. It embraces people\u2019s rights, privileges and opportunities \u2013 made possible, indeed taken for granted, via our membership of the EU. This is especially bad for the young, not least for the 60% of 18- to 24-year-olds who, surveys indicate, think leaving the EU was a mistake. Defeatists tend to say that the EU would not want us back. Certainly they would want to deal with trustworthy people, which Boris Johnson and co were not. But they too are troubled by the consequences of Brexit \u2013 although, as I have said before, they know that what has happened to Britain has acted as a brake on potential leavers in the remaining EU nations. But what happens when the EU offers an olive branch \u2013 a plan for 18- to 30-year-olds in all member countries and the UK to be able to work and study throughout the EU for up to four years? Rishi Sunak rejects it immediately, and Labour follows suit with all that guff about \u201cred lines\u201d. Now, wait for it, the reductio ad absurdum of Labour\u2019s position is this: we are told that it will fight the coming election on the Conservatives\u2019 \u201ceconomic failure\u201d, not on Brexit. This is, I think, a classic example of what my philosopher friends term a \u201ccategory mistake\u201d. Brexit constitutes an integral part of this government\u2019s economic failure. Highlighting that failure, and promising to reverse it, should be central to Labour\u2019s strategy. The fact of the matter is that Starmer was right about Brexit, and the Brexiters who captured the Tory party were wrong. I gather that there are rejoin candidates in the imminent local elections. It might strengthen Starmer\u2019s arm if they do well. It is a commonplace that the British economy is suffering from years of underinvestment, and that this has undoubtedly affected its productivity. There are too many international comparisons from which the UK emerges poorly. In part, the situation resembles the way that successive Conservative and Labour governments in the 1950s and 1960s were concerned about what was known as \u201crelative decline\u201d and decided that one way of dealing with this was to join what was then the Common Market. Association agreements were not enough. We needed the full works. After several failed attempts, we entered the European Economic Community in 1973, and that evolved into the EU, with the added benefit of the formation of the internal \u2013 single \u2013 market, in whose formation we played a crucial role. That gave a vital boost to our economic performance. Now, at a time when there are so many repair jobs to be addressed, but endless complaints about the cost, UK plc needs another boost, and what Keynes called the \u201canimal spirits\u201d of entrepreneurs require a shot in the arm. In my view, a more confident Starmer could provide that if he ceased being mesmerised by \u201cred wall\u201d Brexiters and returned to first principles. Most people now regard Brexit as a serious mistake. Re-entry would be good for investment \u2013 and for growth and tax revenue. As the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney puts it: \u201c\u2018Take back control\u2019 was actually code for \u2018tear down your future.\u2019\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-08T23:01:35Z",
            "content": "An early Easter boosted consumer spending in March and gave Britain\u2019s retailers their best month in more than two years, according to a report. Prompting hopes that the retail sector might be emerging from a protracted soft patch, the latest snapshot of spending in shops and online showed the value of sales above the current inflation rate for the first time since the early days of the cost of living crisis. The monthly sales monitor from the British Retail Consortium and the accountancy firm KPMG said the value of sales was up by 3.5% in March on a year earlier. Inflation as measured by the consumer prices index stood at 3.4% in February and is expected to have fallen to about 3% in March. Linda Ellett, the KPMG UK head of consumer markets, leisure and retail, said the Easter pickup in spending pointed to the possibility of \u201cgreen shoots of recovery\u201d for retailers. \u201cHigh street sales growth was driven by food and drink, health and beauty and keen gardeners who headed outside to enjoy the first days of spring. There were also some signs of improvement, with more categories starting to see positive sales growth in March for the first time in months.\u201d Ellett said the environment for retailers remained challenging and that consumer confidence was fragile despite the fall in inflation and the indication that interest rates had peaked at 5.25%. \u201cAs April signals big increases in the sector\u2019s cost base \u2013 through the rise in minimum wage rates and business rate hikes for the larger high street brands \u2013 retailers will be hoping that the bounceback of March sales is more than just an Easter blip,\u201d she said. A separate report from Barclays found card spending grew at an annual rate of 1.9% \u2013 below the inflation rate \u2013 as wet weather deterred consumers from visiting high street stores and restaurants. Karen Johnson, the head of retail at Barclays, said: \u201cRetailers were braced for a more subdued start to 2024, and recent figures are in line with expectations. The wet weather has been a key factor in the slowdown in discretionary spending, as it\u2019s meant fewer visits to the high street and to hospitality venues. \u201cHowever, in spite of this initial lull, many retailers are confident that spending will rebound in the coming months, particularly in anticipation of better weather, the energy price cap drop, an uplift in the national minimum wage, and the buzz around major events such as Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour and the Paris 2024 Olympics.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-06T11:00:33Z",
            "content": "As fast-food workers celebrated a pivotal wage increase to $20 an hour in California last week, an old economic debate was awakened by business groups and others claiming the increase will wind up hurting workers through reduced hours and layoffs, hurt customers with price hikes, and harm the franchise owners of fast-food restaurants. Their critics are not so sure. The hard-fought wage increase to $20 an hour from California\u2019s current minimum wage, $16 an hour, was a compromise to initial demands of $22 an hour with annual wage increases. Representatives of fast-food workers and the fast-food industry came to a deal to avoid what would have been a costly ballot initiative over the passage and signing of the California fast-food sector bill last year. \u201cFrontline workers like me organized, went on strike, and fought to pass a historic law that raises our wages and gives us a seat at table with some of the biggest fast-food corporations in the world,\u201d said Anjelica Hernandez, a McDonald\u2019s worker in Los Angeles for nearly 20 years. \u201cEven though we are the engine of a billion-dollar industry, too many of us struggle to keep up with rent, our bills and the rising cost of living.\u201d The minimum wage for fast-food workers at larger chains was agreed last September and increased to $20 an hour on 1 April, but numerous reports have already been made that the wage hike is resulting in job losses and price increases for customers. The decision by two Pizza Hut franchises in California to lay off more than 1,000 delivery driver employees and rely on gig delivery drivers instead has been cited in claims that the minimum wage rise will result in layoffs and job losses. \u201cThe reality is that delivery drivers have become more numerous in the last couple years because of Covid,\u201d said Michael Reich, UC Berkeley chair of the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics. \u201cThe pizza companies have been moving to make their delivery drivers not employees but instead rely on these delivery services for quite some time. And I think Pizza Hut is going to make this change anyway.\u201d Reich also argued that previous research had found employment increases as a result of higher minimum wage, lowers turnover rates for businesses, and makes it easier to recruit and retain employees. The research is unlikely to deter attacks. A group representing fast-food franchise owners poured more than half a million dollars into political donations for ads opposing elected officials who helped craft and pass the legislation. A Wall Street Journal op-ed referred to the California wage increase as \u201ccrazy\u201d for paying \u201cburger flippers\u201d $20 an hour. The New York Post claimed Los Angeles fast-food chains increased prices on 1 April in response to the law, including citing price increases at the actor Kevin Hart\u2019s chain Hart House, which doesn\u2019t have enough locations to be subjected to the new law, which stipulates the chains must have at least 60 restaurants nationwide. A McDonald\u2019s franchise owner of 21 locations complained to a local Los Angeles news outlet that they could not \u201craise prices enough\u201d. McDonald\u2019s and Chipotle blamed the wage increase for anticipated price hikes in California ahead of the wage increase taking effect. El Pollo Loco claimed it would be looking into automation to cut labor costs due to the law. The Center for Union Facts, a non-profit founded by a Washington lobbyist, Rick Berman, who 60 Minutes referred to as \u201cDr Evil\u201d for his tactics in advocating for business interests, is running television advertisements in California claiming the wage increase is a \u201cwrecking ball\u201d for the fast-food industry. But researchers have long criticized these claims of causation which have frequently been made in response to minimum wage increases around the US, all of which have come at the state level because Washington has failed to act on raising the federal minimum wage from the $7.25 an hour minimum last passed in 2009. \u201cOverall, study after study shows that increases to the minimum wage actually have a net gain. They produce a stimulus effect. If you give poor people more money, they\u2019re going to spend it locally, including on rent, utilities and housing. It doesn\u2019t get much more local than that, and that increased spending actually produces jobs,\u201d said Tia Koonse, legal and policy research manager at the UCLA Labor Center. An analysis of financial data over the past decade by researchers at the Roosevelt Institute found the fast-food industry has more than enough profits to raise wages without affecting prices and employment and have been hiking prices far beyond their operating costs for years. \u201cIn 2023 alone, the 10 largest publicly traded fast-food companies spent $6.1bn on share repurchases,\u201d noted the report. \u201cAs with most industries, the fast-food industry has historically charged higher prices than their marginal costs. However, between 2014 and 2023, markups increased at an annual rate of 2.2%, faster than at any period since 1978.\u201d Ali Bustamante, author of the report and deputy director of worker power and economic security at the Roosevelt Institute, added: \u201cThere\u2019s really an opportunity here to revert profits back into workers back into the source of productivity for these businesses in a way that is going to be beneficial, not just for the overall economy, but certainly for these businesses in the long term.\u201d"

The IMF has warned that domestic shocks in emerging economies in the G20 are increasingly impacting growth in the rich world Over in Panama, a criminal trial of 27 employees working for the law firm at the heart of the Panama Papers on money laundering charges has begun. Eight years ago, leaked financial records from the law firm Mossack Fonseca sparked international outrage at the use of offshore companies by wealthy individuals to commit tax fraud and hide assets. In 2016, files from Mossack Fonseca were leaked to reporters at the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the US-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Reporters from more than 100 media organisations, including the Guardian, collaborated to investigate the 11.5m files. The firm\u2019s founders, J\u00fcrgen Mossack and Ram\u00f3n Fonseca Mora, are among those facing charges. They have previously denied any allegations against them, arguing that they had no control over the offshore companies that the firm set up for its clients. If convicted, they reportedly face up to 12 years in prison. More here: Shocks from emerging markets are having a more serious impact on growth among rich countries, the International Monetary Fund has warned. In a new report, the IMF highlights that spillovers from shocks in G20 emerging markets\u2014particularly China\u2014have increased since 2000, and are now comparable in size to those from shocks in advanced economies. Trade, notably through global value chains, is a key channel for shocks to propagate through the global economy, the IMF says, in Chapter 3 of its latest World Economic Outlook. The IMF points out that a pick-up in emerging markets could benefit wealthier countries, but cautions that policymakers should protect themselves from the threat of disruption. The report says: Spillovers generate a reallocation of economic activity across firms and sectors in other countries. Looking ahead, a plausible growth acceleration in G20 emerging markets, even excluding China, could support global growth over the medium term and spill over to other countries. Policymakers in recipient economies should maintain sufficient buffers and strengthen policy frameworks to manage the possibility of larger shocks from G20 emerging markets. One of AstraZeneca\u2019s top shareholders has thrown its weight behind CEO Pascal Soriot, over the row about his multi-million pay package that comes to a boil this week. Rajiv Jain, chief investment officer of Florida-based GQG Partners, says Soriot deserves the maximum package of \u00a318.6m which has been lined up for this year. Jain told the Financial Times: \u201cThere is a compensation issue at AstraZeneca.

Soriot received almost \u00a317m last year, taking his earnings over the last decade at AZ to around. \u00a3120m. The High Pay Centre has argued that such high earnings aren\u2019t justifiable. Credit rating agency Fitch has downgraded its rating on Thames Water\u2019s parent company, Kemble, after it defaulted on its debts last week by missing an interest payment. Fitch has cut Kemble Water Finance Limited\u2019s rating to \u2018C\u2019 from \u2018CC\u2019, which is just one step above being in default. Fitch explains: The downgrade reflects Kemble\u2019s missed payments of interest due last week and the consequent formal notice of default sent to its debtholders. Kemble has also sent formal notice of the cancellation of its undrawn \u00a3150m working capital facility to the relevant agent. The company has appointed an advisor to support restructuring discussions with creditors. Fitch adds that it would downgrade Kemble again to \u2018Restricted Default\u2019 (RD) once the grace period to make the missed payment has expired, or if the group is restructured. As reported earlier, bonds issued by other water companies are suffering a knock-on impact from Thames (see 13.12pm)\u2026 while Australian investment bank Macquarie has emerged as a lender to Kemble. The King has been presented with the first banknotes bearing his portrait by the Governor of the Bank of England. Charles received a leather-bound booklet containing the historic legal tender from Andrew Bailey at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday.

The firm behind the Wildwood chain of restaurants has revealed plans to shut a raft of sites as part of a major restructuring. Tasty, which also runs sites under Dim T brand, said it plans to exit around 20 loss-making restaurants after a \u201cchallenging\u201d start to the year. The restructuring plan would see the group shut 18 of these restaurants, with two of these sites already closed to customers. The crisis at Thames Water appears to be hitting the price of bonds issued by fellow water companies. Bloomberg has spotted that the risk premium on two recently-issued bonds from the sector has increased since they started trading. This risk premium measures the gap between the yield on these bonds, compared to lending to the government. BBG says: Southern Water Services Finance Ltd. bonds have widened 13 basis points since their March 19 pricing. Northumbrian Water Finance Plc\u2019s notes widened four basis points since pricing on March 22. That makes them underperformers among investment-grade peers whose spreads mostly narrowed in new-issue trading. Last week, Thames\u2019 parent company, Kemble, defaulted on its debt, raising fears it could face a significant restructure or even ultimately collapse. Today, it emerged that Australian investment bank Macquarie, which has been criticised for its role in the privatisation of England\u2019s water industry, is one of Kemble\u2019s lenders, and could play an important role in determining its future. Before today, gold had already set a new record price for seven days running in the London bullion market, according to data from online market BullionVault. Today\u2019s gains mean it is on track to beat the record stretch of new daily records set in March 2008. Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault, says: \u201cWhile the size of gold\u2019s price gain isn\u2019t unprecedented, its strength is. So too is what\u2019s underpinning this bull run, with heavy profit-taking by Western investors offset by central banks led by China continuing to hoard bullion as Chinese households also keep buying amid the country\u2019s real-estate slump and economic slowdown.\u201d Marks &amp; Spencer is investing \u00a31m in tackling the methane produced by cows by changing the diet of the herds that provide its milk.

Could Shell deal a major blow to the City of London by moving its stock market listing to New York instead? The oil giant\u2019s CEO, Wael Sawan, has told Bloomberg that Shell would have to consider a shift if the gap between valuations in the UK and US doesn\u2019t narrow. Sawan told Bloomberg\u2019s Javier Blas last month that he is trying to fix Shell\u2019s problems by cutting costs, cutting underperforming units, and buying back shares with free cash. Sawan added: \u201cIf we work through the sprint, and we are doing what we are doing, and we still don\u2019t see that the gap is closing, we have to look at all options.\u201d This morning, Sawan\u2019s predecessor Ben van Beurden has fanned the flames, saying that the gap in valuations across the Atlantic is a \u201cmajor issue\u201d which makes it more likely that companies will consider moving their listings to New York. Van Beurden told the FT Global Commodities summit that Shell was \u201cmassively undervalued\u201d, while deeper capital pools and more favourable attitudes towards conventional energy companies make the US more attractive than Europe. Shell is currently valued at \u00a3180bn, with a price/earnings ratio of 12.6. New York-listed rival Exxon is worth $478bn (\u00a3376bn), with a p/e ratio of 13.59, meaning Exxon is more highly valued than Shell compared to its earnings. Back in the markets, the pound has hit its highest level against the US dollar in over two weeks. Sterling is up 0.25% this morning at $1.268, the highest since 21 March \u2013 when the pound tumbled after the Bank of England left interest rates on hold but hinted that cuts were coming. Confidence among US small businesses have dropped to its lowest level in over a decade, as inflation worries dog firms. The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index has slipped to 88.5 points for March, the lowest level since December 2012. This is the 27th month running when the optimism gauge has been below the 50-year average of 98. NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg says: \u201cSmall business optimism has reached the lowest level since 2012 as owners continue to manage numerous economic headwinds. Inflation has once again been reported as the top business problem on Main Street and the labor market has only eased slightly.\u201d Twenty-five percent of owners reported that inflation (due to higher input costs and wages) was their single most important problem in operating their business, up two points from February. Over at News Corp, the Murdoch media empire, its UK newspapers are showing diverging fortunes. News Group Newspapers, which publishes The Sun, has reported a loss of \u00a366.5m for the year to 2 July 2023, an improvement on the \u00a3127m it lost in 2022. Online reader numbers fell \u2013 with The Sun\u2019s digital audience falling to 23.8m from 27.8m in 2022. News Group Newspapers also used to publish the News Of the World, which closed in 2011 in the phone hacking scandal. In 2022, it failed to force a deadline on potential victims to make claims against it. Today\u2019s results show the ongoing costs of those legal claims; News Group Newspapers ran up over \u00a350m of one-off charges, related to legal cases over allegations of voicemail interceptions (including \u00a35.3m of claimants\u2019 legal fees and damages), down from \u00a3128m in 2022. The picture is brighter at Times Media, publisher of The Times and the Sunday Times, whose earnings are making up for The Sun\u2019s losses. It made a pre-tax profit of \u00a360.9m for last year, down from \u00a373.2m in 2022, but turnover rose to \u00a3385m from \u00a3373m. Gold is continuing to rise into uncharted territory, and has now reached $2,362 per ounce. Mexican precious metals mining company Fresnillo is benefitting from the rally in gold and silver. Fresnillo is leading the risers on the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 share index this morning, up 4.4%, to its highest level since the start of January. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, says gold is being driven up by \u201ca surge in haven demand\u201d due to the turbulent geopolitical background: Iran\u2019s explicit threat of military retaliation following Israel\u2019s targeting of its Syrian embassy has escalated tensions, amplifying the spectre of a broader regional conflict with potentially unforeseeable repercussions. Concurrently, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine exacerbates investor anxieties. Gold, the world\u2019s oldest safe-haven asset, has \u201cgone on a tear this year\u201d despite the negative pressure exerted by rising bond yields and a firmer US dollar, says Marios Hadjikyriacos, senior investment analyst at XM. Hadjikyriacos explains: Gold has been turbocharged by purchases from central banks, with China leading the charge as the nation seeks to reduce its dependence on the US dollar. Chinese consumers have also gone on a buying spree, searching for protection from the crash in local property and equity markets. Safe haven flows probably played a role too, amidst an unstable geopolitical landscape. In the near term, the risk is that this rally has gone too far, too fast. Momentum oscillators detect extreme overbought conditions, warning of a potential pullback in gold prices. But aside from the rally looking overstretched, the fundamentals still favor gold buyers. Gold represents only about 4% of China\u2019s official foreign exchange reserves, so there is lots of scope for these purchases to continue. Similarly, gold can still benefit from falling yields as central banks begin to slash interest rates, particularly if the global economy loses steam. The precise drivers of the gold\u2019s price\u2019s surge this year aren\u2019t quite clear. Gold commentator Ross Norman, CEO at Metals Daily, wrote last week that he was mystified by gold\u2019s rally, pointing out that demand from institutions and western buyers has dropped this year. He suggested that algorythmic traders \u2013 buying gold because it\u2019s gone up, fuelling the rally. Another possibility is that US mutual funds are buying gold in preparation for US interest rate cuts this year (as gold doesn\u2019t provide a yield, it is less attractive when interest rates are higher). Norman says: Quite possibly it is a combination of Chinese and official sector buying from other routes, coupled in some sectors with mounting uncertainty over US debt and its manageability. If so, then this could be regarded as extremely \u201chigh quality\u201d buying in that it is unlikely to be reversed ... and this rally is strong and has legs to run ... on the other hand, if it is one of those damn algos then expect trouble ahead ... after all, momentum can travel in two directions. Gold has hit a new all-time high this morning. The spot price of gold has risen to $2,365.39 per ounce, above Monday\u2019s record high, meaning gold has now risen by 14% since the start of 2024. Gold is traditionally seen as a safe-haven in difficult times, and as a hedge against inflation. Analysts say gold has been lifted by geopolitical tensions, with war in Ukraine and the Middle East encouraging some traders to put money into bullion. Some central banks have also been adding to their gold reserves. with China\u2019s central bank purchased gold for its reserves for a 17th straight month in March. The price of other precious metals, such as silver, have also been rising, as Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com, explains: Both metals have been in demand, particularly gold, essentially because of years of high inflation chipping away at the value of fiat currencies, which is the same reason why Bitcoin has also been hitting record levels. Up until a couple of weeks ago, silver wasn\u2019t finding much love. But stronger industrial data from China earlier in the week pointed to stronger demand for industrial materials like copper and silver. Shares in BP have hit their highest level in over five months, after it told the City that its oil and gas production rose in the last quarter. In a trading update this morning, BP guided that upstream production in the first quarter is expected to be higher compared to the prior quarter, with production higher in oil production and operations and slightly higher in gas and low carbon energy. BP shares have gained 1.3% to 516p, the highest since the end of October. Shares have been benefiting from the increase in the crude oil price this year, with Brent crude having risen from $77/barrel at the end of 2023 to over $90/barrel today. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: \u201cBP says it expects a strong first quarter for oil and gas trading as well as a quarter-on-quarter improvement in upstream production of low-carbon energy and oil &amp; gas. It also expects an improvement to its oil refining margins this quarter when it reports results on 7th May in the first set of earnings since Murray Auchincloss became permanent CEO in January following the abrupt departure of Bernard Looney last year. It looks like BP is poised for another strong quarterly scorecard after results in the final three months of 2023 outpaced expectations and the new CEO enticed investors by ramping up BP\u2019s share buyback programme. Supporting BP and its rivals is an upward trend for underlying oil prices with geopolitical supply shocks and improving global demand pushing Brent crude above $90 a barrel this month, reigniting the possibility of $100 oil again in the months ahead.\u201d An early Easter boosted consumer spending in March and gave Britain\u2019s retailers their best month in more than two years. Prompting hopes that the retail sector might be emerging from a protracted soft patch, the latest snapshot of spending in shops and online showed the value of sales above the current inflation rate for the first time since the early days of the cost of living crisis. The monthly sales monitor from the British Retail Consortium and the accountancy firm KPMG said the value of sales was up by 3.5% in March on a year earlier. Inflation as measured by the consumer prices index stood at 3.4% in February and is expected to have fallen to about 3% in March. Linda Ellett, the KPMG UK head of consumer markets, leisure and retail, said the Easter pickup in spending pointed to the possibility of \u201cgreen shoots of recovery\u201d for retailers. Investors are losing faith that central banks will make hefty cuts to interest rates this year. Futures traders have reduced bets on how much the US Federal Reserve will cut rates this year to the lowest level since October, LSEG data shows. Traders now expect fewer than three quarter-point cuts to US interest rates this year, down from up to six cuts expected in January. Reuters explains: Fed funds futures contracts for December on Monday reflected expectations of around 60 basis points in rate cuts this year, compared to some 150 basis points that had been priced at the start of 2024. The prospect of a first 25 basis point cut in June stood at 49%, down from 57% a week ago, CME Group data showed on Monday. This repricing follows stronger than expected US economic data, such as last Friday\u2019s forecast-beating US employment report showing 303,000 new jobs were created in March. Yesterday, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that inflation coud be stickier than forecast, leading to higher interest rates than markets expect. For the UK, traders expect the Bank of England to cut rates to 4.5% by the end of this year, from 5.25% at present. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Argentina\u2019s currency crisis has come back to bite HSBC, as it announces the sale of its operations in the South American country. HSBC is selling its business in Argentina \u2013 which covers banking, asset management and insurance and $100 million in subordinated debt - to Grupo Financiero Galicia for $550m. But, HSBC will record a $1bn pre-tax loss on the sale, as it will crystallise losses it has been running on the Argentinian peso-denominated book value of HSBC Argentina when converted into US dollars. HSBC will also recognise $4.9bn in historical currency translation reserve losses when the deal closes. Those losses swelled by $1.8bn last year because of the devaluation of Argentina\u2019s peso. Last December, Argentina\u2019s libertarian government led by Javier Milei devalued the peso by about half, as part of their economic shock treatment. The sale will help fund HSBC\u2019s pivot strategy of shifting capital to India and China. Noel Quinn, HSBC\u2019s chief executive, says the bank is pleased to have agreed the sale of HSBC Argentina. This transaction is another important step in the execution of our strategy and enables us to focus our resources on higher value opportunities across our international network. HSBC Argentina is largely a domestically focused business, with limited connectivity to the rest of our international network. Furthermore, given its size, it also generates substantial earnings volatility for the Group when its results are translated into US dollars. Galicia is better placed to invest in and grow the business. \u201cWe remain committed to Mexico and the US, and to serving our international clients throughout our global network with our leading transaction banking capabilities.\u201d The agenda 7.45am BST: French trade balance for February 1pm BST: Mexico\u2019s inflation rate for March 3pm BST: RealClearMarkets/TIPP index of US economic optimism 6.30pm BST: IMF to publish chapter 3 of its Global Financial Stability Report"

            "date": "2024-04-04T11:00:09Z",
            "content": "Describing debut albums as long-awaited is par for the course, but in Fabiana Palladino\u2019s case it\u2019s also perfectly true. It\u2019s been 13 years since she started self-releasing her songs online, and seven since she was announced as the first signing to Paul Institute, a label that seems to share the admirably unhurried approach of its co-founder, Jai Paul. Few figures in 21st-century pop seem to have achieved so much by doing so little as Paul, who has managed to garner an extraordinary reputation \u2013 the Guardian has described him as both \u201cera-defining\u201d and \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime talent\u201d \u2013 despite the fact that he\u2019s only released three official singles in a music career that stretches back to 2007. His endorsement carries considerable clout, but Palladino\u2019s output seemed to slow rather than accelerate after she became involved with Paul Institute. She took to releasing a solitary song every year or two while working as a session musician for the Maccabees, Jessie Ware, Sampha and indeed Paul: she was part of the band performing at a handful of 2023 live shows that, if nothing else, proved that Paul\u2019s mythology has only grown. Demand was such that you couldn\u2019t purchase a ticket; you had to be entered into a lottery to win the right to buy one. The official line is that Palladino\u2019s eponymous debut album took so long to arrive as a result of its author\u2019s perfectionism, an excuse that\u2019s surprisingly easy to believe when you hear it. It is largely self-produced and fantastically well made. Palladino is the daughter of celebrated session bassist Pino Palladino, and she has clearly made good use of the contacts on her dad\u2019s phone, given his presence here alongside the equally celebrated session drummer Steve Ferrone and arranger Rob Moose, best known for his work with Blake Mills (with whom Palladino Sr made his 2021 album Notes With Attachments). It\u2019s a situation that you might decry as nepotistic if Fabiana Palladino was a luxuriously appointed dud, but she\u2019s nothing of the sort: the presence of some august blue chip musicians can\u2019t account for how good the songs here are. All 10 boast killer melodies \u2013 in a more just world recent single Stay With Me Through the Night would have been a huge hit, and the charts a brighter place for it \u2013 and Palladino\u2019s voice has understated power. Musically, it sets its sights on refracting a series of styles associated with the mid-80s. There\u2019s a nod to the sampled clanks and crashes of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis\u2019s cutting-edge productions for Janet Jackson on Can You Look in the Mirror? and the chugging guitars from the rockier end of Prince\u2019s oeuvre on Shoulda. It isn\u2019t a stretch to imagine I Can\u2019t Dream Anymore soundtracking a love scene in a glossy Hollywood blockbuster of the era. But for all the knowing signifiers from the age of power-dressing and rolled-up suit sleeves (and mid-80s signifiers come no more knowing than In the Fire\u2019s attempt to restore the tarnished image of synthesised pan-pipes), the album never feels like a retro exercise. There\u2019s a very modern hint of chaos lurking at the edges of its sound: grimy distortion around the beat of Can You Look in the Mirror?, the clangorous, faintly off-key synth sound that underpins In the Fire, the oddly distracted quality to Paul\u2019s guest vocal on I Care, the weird, electronically scrambled vocal that adds a peculiar edge to the slow jam Deeper\u2019s intro. The push and pull of the album\u2019s sound \u2013 the comfortingly familiar up against modernity; the super-slickness of its mid-80s influences against the more ramshackle approach of 2024 \u2013 mirrors a certain push and pull in its lyrics, which depict the conflicting stages of a failing relationship, from icy diffidence to desperate attempts to hold together, often through songs that aren\u2019t as they first appear. Closer initially presents as a lustful come-on, but gradually reveals itself as a dismissal, albeit one delivered in a breathily affecting voice. The protagonist turns out not to be edging closer to a lover, but to a decision to ditch said lover: \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I want you around.\u201d \u201cI care, I care for you,\u201d she sings beseechingly elsewhere, before adding: \u201cI think so, anyway.\u201d Lyrics aside, nothing else about the album speaks of uncertainty or indecision. Devoid of weak tracks or ideas that don\u2019t gel, it\u2019s an album that sounds as if it was made by someone who knows exactly what she\u2019s doing. You could hold it up as a lesson in the value of taking your time and being selective, in a world where artists \u2013 particularly new artists \u2013 are encouraged to bombard listeners with a constant barrage of product. Or you could take its appealingly scuffed gloss as symbolic of nothing more than the flowering of an original pop voice: Fabiana Palladino might well be one of 2024\u2019s best debut albums. This week Alexis listened to Shygirl \u2013 Making the Beast Shygirl has always cut a distinctive figure among the UK rap firmament: as underlined by Making the Beast\u2019s heady, acidic house and languid vocal."

            "date": "2024-04-19T15:36:14Z",
            "content": "It was an unlikely setting for a revolution. But at Lee Valley VeloPark, where Team GB\u2019s cyclists dominated at London 2012, the International Olympic Committee on Friday set the wheels in motion for how artificial intelligence could transform the sporting landscape. \u201cAI will be a revolution for our society,\u201d the IOC president, Thomas Bach, said. \u201cAnd it will be a revolution for sport. It will be a fascinating new lap in the Olympic race \u2013 and in Olympic history.\u201d Delegates, including Silicon Valley experts and legendary figures such as Nadia Comaneci and Lindsey Vonn, then sat through presentations about how AI will be what the IOC called a \u201cgamechanger\u201d. Some innovations will be seen at the Paris 2024 Games while others are designed to spot the talent of the future or even bring the past alive. \u201cAI can help to identify talents in every corner of the world,\u201d said Bach at the launch of what the IOC called its AI Agenda. \u201cAI can provide more athletes with access to personalised training methods, superior sports equipment and more individualised programmes to stay fit and healthy. \u201cAI can also revolutionise judging and refereeing, thereby strengthening fairness in sport. AI can improve safeguarding in sport. AI will make organising sporting events extremely efficient, will transform sports broadcasting and will make the spectator experience much more individualised and immersive.\u201d One video showed AI capturing a diver in real time, with a screen immediately telling a judge the height of his jump, the number of rotations in the air and measuring how close his legs were to his torso as he spun. The aim is to give the judge a better idea of the quality of the dive and therefore to award a fairer score. \u201cWe are not going to disclose all the innovations for Paris, but what we are doing in diving can be translated to other sports as well,\u201d said Alain Zobrist, the CEO of Swiss Timing. \u201cThe AI model can show the rotations, speeds, angles, everything that is really crucial for a judge. AI splits the dive in sequences and analyses it in less than a 10th of a second. And it can be shared with fans in real time so they better understand where someone gained and lost points.\u201d Another project involved Intel going to villages in Senegal and using AI to spot potential sporting talent based on filming children jumping, running, wrestling and doing press-ups on a mobile phone, with AI tracking their speed, distance and the biometrics of their movement. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely huge,\u201d said Christoph Schell of Intel, who claimed it had identified 40 kids with significant talent. \u201cWe toured five villages and scouted 1,000 kids. We are making it a level playing field for talent. And this can help advise parents about what sport their kids should choose.\u201d Another AI project was used to colourise black and white footage from the Paris 1924 Games and to show runners drinking red wine in the marathon. The double Olympic triathlon champion Alistair Brownlee said he was intrigued by what he had seen. \u201cI\u2019m interested in sports optimisation and how AI might help people go faster, have fewer injuries, and things like fan engagement. But we heard about 50 things today where it could make a difference,\u201d said Brownlee, who is also an IOC Athletes\u2019 commission member. Asked about the potential dangers of AI, he said: \u201cToday has been about strategy, which by its very nature is very blue sky and positive. But there are dangers without doubt too. What are the safeguards? And what about the ethical things that people need to work out? Using AI to help with judging will make things fairer. But how do you make sure AI augments judges and doesn\u2019t replace them?\u201d"

            "content": "Nike\u2019s Team USA track and field kit for women is needlessly revealing and sexist, female athletes have said after the sportswear brand unveiled its outfits for this summer\u2019s Olympic Games. Images made public on Thursday of the women\u2019s kit on a mannequin, showing a very high-cut pantyline, triggered criticism from several athletes for what they saw as a decision to prioritize skimpiness over function. \u201cThey are absolutely not made for performance,\u201d US steeplechaser Colleen Quigley said in a message to Reuters. Lauren Fleshman, the US national champion in the 5000m in 2006 and 2010, shared even harsher criticism in an Instagram post, writing: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but show me one WNBA or NWSL team who would enthusiastically support this kit. This is for Olympic Track and Field. Professional athletes should be able to compete without dedicating brain space to constant pube vigilance or the mental gymnastics of having every vulnerable piece of your body on display. Women\u2019s kits should be in service to performance, mentally and physically. If this outfit was truly beneficial to physical performance, men would wear it.\u201d She added: \u201cThis is not an elite athletic kit for track and field. This is a costume born of patriarchal forces that are no longer welcome or needed to get eyes on women\u2019s sports. ... Stop making it harder for half the population @nike @teamusa @usatf.\u201d Tara Davis-Woodhall, an American who placed sixth in the long jump at the Tokyo Games and took silver at last year\u2019s world championships, reacted with equal parts humor and horror, commenting: \u201cWait my hoo haa is gonna be out.\u201d Debate has raged for years over more revealing outfits for female Olympians in disciplines from beach volleyball to gymnastics, and some rules on competition wear are changing. Germany\u2019s women\u2019s gymnastics team wore full-length bodysuits at the Tokyo Olympics, in what they said was a stand against sexualisation in the sport. Gymnastics New Zealand last week updated its attire rules to allow women and girls to wear shorts or leggings over their leotards. Nike said in an email to Reuters that it was offering athletes unitard options with both a brief and a short for this Olympics, whereas it only offered the brief for the Tokyo Olympics. Nike\u2019s track and field kits for men and women include nearly 50 apparel pieces and 12 competition styles for specific events, the brand said when launching the outfits. Nike-sponsored pole vaulter Katie Moon, in a post on X, said the kit shown on the mannequin was \u201cconcerning\u201d, but added that women athletes are given many options on what to wear, and that she prefers briefs to shorts. A spokesperson for USA Track &amp; Field said: \u201cAthlete options and choices were the driving force for USATF in the planning process with Nike.\u201d US middle-distance runner Athing Mu and US sprinter Sha\u2019Carri Richardson were among the athletes modelling Nike\u2019s Olympic kits at the launch show in Paris. While Mu wore briefs, Richardson wore a version of the outfit with shorts. Quigley said Nike should also offer athletes who make the team custom tailoring to ensure the kit fits perfectly. \u201cOur bodies are all different and it seems silly to expect us to compete at the highest level of our sport without a properly fit uniform,\u201d she said. Nike told Reuters it will have tailors available for Olympic and Paralympic athletes this year."

            "content": "For $5m, Louisiana\u2019s flagship university will let an oil company weigh in on faculty research activities. Or, for $100,000, a corporation can participate in a research study, with \u201crobust\u201d reviewing powers and access to all resulting intellectual property. Those are the conditions outlined in a boilerplate document that Louisiana State University\u2019s fundraising arm circulated to oil majors and chemical companies affiliated with the Louisiana Chemical Association, an industry lobbying group, according to emails disclosed in response to a public records request by the Lens. Records show that after Shell donated $25m in 2022 to LSU to create the Institute for Energy Innovation, the university gave the fossil fuel corporation license to influence research and coursework for the university\u2019s new concentration in carbon capture, use and storage. Afterward, LSU\u2019s fundraising entity, the LSU Foundation, used this partnership as a model to shop around to members of the Louisiana Chemical Association, such as ExxonMobil, Air Products and CF Industries, which have proposed carbon capture projects in Louisiana. For $2m, Exxon became the institute\u2019s first \u201cstrategic partner-level donor\u201d, a position that came with robust review of academic study output and with the ability to focus research activities. Another eight companies have discussed similar deals with LSU, according to a partnership update that LSU sent to Shell last summer. Some students, academics and experts said such relationships raise questions about academic freedom and public trust. Asked to comment, the Institute for Energy Innovation\u2019s director, Brad Ives, defended the partnerships, as did the oil majors. Two more companies have since entered into partnerships with the Institute for Energy Innovation, said Ives. But Shell is the only company to have donated at the level that gave the company a seat on the advisory board that chooses the institute\u2019s research. The head of the Louisiana Chemical Association and the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association also sit on the advisory board, which can vote to stop a research project from moving forward. Ives said being able to work with oil and gas companies is \u201creally a key to advancing energy innovation\u201d. A spokesperson for Shell said: \u201cWe\u2019re proud to partner with LSU to contribute to the growing compendium of peer-reviewed climate science and advance the effort to identify multiple pathways that can lead to more energy with fewer emissions.\u201d An ExxonMobil spokesperson said: \u201cOur collaboration with LSU and the Institute for Energy Innovation includes an allocation for research in carbon capture utilization and storage, as well as advanced recycling studies.\u201d LSU has long had a close-relationship with oil majors, the names of which hang from buildings and equipment at the university. Nearly 40% of LSU funding comes from the state, which received a good chunk of its revenue from oil and gas activities until the 1980s. In recent years, oil and gas revenue has made up less than 10% of the state budget. But the new, highly visible partnership with Shell took the closeness a step further, promising corporations voting power over the Institute for Energy Innovation\u2019s research activities in return for their investment. \u201cI have a hard time seeing a faculty member engaged in legitimate research being eager for an oil company or representative of a chemical company to vote on his or her research agenda,\u201d said Robert Mann, political commentator and former LSU journalism professor. \u201cThat is an egregious violation of academic freedom. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect to see it written down like that,\u201d Mann said, after the Lens asked him to review the boilerplate document that outlines what companies can expect in return for their donations to LSU\u2019s Institute for Energy Innovation. It is not appropriate, Mann said, for faculty research to be driven by the decisions of the dean of a university, let alone an outside industry representative. \u201cIf you\u2019re a faculty member in that unit you should know that the university is fine with auctioning off your academic freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.\u201d Ives of LSU said its Institute for Energy Innovation is no different to similar institutes across the US, including the Texas Bureau of Economic Geology, which performs research supported by corporate donors. \u201cI think researchers saying that somehow having corporate funding for research damages the integrity of that research is a little far-fetched,\u201d Ives said. Research performed at the institute is subject to the faculty\u2019s individual ethics training and subject to peer-review, he said. \u201cA donor that provided money that goes to the institute isn\u2019t going to be able to influence the outcome of that research in any way.\u201d Asked about the relationship with the institute and industry, Karsten Thompson, the interim dean of the College of Engineering at LSU said: \u201cTo me, it\u2019s not a conflict at all. It\u2019s a partnership because they\u2019re the ones that are going to make the largest initial impacts on reducing CO2 emissions.\u201d Some observers, noting that fossil fuel companies have previously shown a vested interest in obscuring scientific conclusions, question the reliability of academic studies sponsored by fossil fuel companies. Exxon, for example, denied the risk of human-caused climate change for decades, noted Jane Patton, an LSU alumna and the US fossil economy campaign manager for the Center for International Environmental Law. After the Lens asked her to review LSU communication on the matter, Patton said she suspected that fossil fuel companies have had a say in what does and doesn\u2019t get studied in relation to risky endeavors, such as carbon capture, which involves chemically stripping carbon dioxide from industrial emissions and piping it underground. For her, the LSU documents basically proved her fear. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen actual evidence of it,\u201d Patton said. \u201cThis is a gross misuse of the public trust.\u201d To Patton, the perceived blurring of academic objectivity could not come at a worse time in Louisiana, as the climate crisis makes the state less habitable and housing more expensive. \u201cIt\u2019s just disheartening,\u201d she said, \u201cto find that the state\u2019s flagship institution is allowing industry to determine the research agenda. No wonder it\u2019s so hard to find peer-reviewed research about how bad this is.\u201d Records show that Shell helped to tailor what LSU students would learn in the six courses offered under the institute\u2019s carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) concentration that debuted a couple years ago. The LSU alumnus Lee Stockwell, Shell\u2019s general manager of CCUS, sat on the search committee for the Energy Institute executive director, served on the petroleum engineering advisory board, and was very involved in shaping the carbon capture curriculum. Stockwell directed questions about Shell\u2019s partnership with the university to LSU. Stockwell was not the only oil representative to help design the curriculum. BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil also had representatives on the ad hoc advisory committee that designed carbon capture coursework within the petroleum engineering department, according to a July 2022 email from Thompson. At least one cohort of students took two elective courses at LSU designed by the oil majors and another 10 students were expected to take the full concentration beginning in 2022. LSU is not alone in this practice, Thompson said. At most engineering departments in the country, an active Industrial Advisory Committee (IAC) weighs in on curricula, so that degrees evolve as technology changes, helping students land internships and jobs. LSU faculty has not been similarly engaged with renewable energy companies, because oil and gas companies have the resources to tackle the climate crisis now \u2013 and are not reliant on future technology, Thompson said. \u201cRenewable energy is much more abstract,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I think that\u2019s the difference. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t care as much.\u201d Fossil fuel companies have been finding their way into classrooms for decades, in part to help the industry retain a positive public image in the face of a heating planet. Some students do not approve of the university\u2019s partnerships with fossil fuel companies, or any financial ties with them. For a decade now, students across the nation have filed complaints and demanded divestment from fossil fuels and hundreds of institutions have agreed. Locally, the LSU Climate Pelicans, an interdisciplinary group of students, have called for the university to divest endowment funds from the fossil fuel industry. Inspired by the Climate Pelicans\u2019 work toward divestment, the LSU graduate student Alicia Cerquone, who sits on the LSU\u2019s student senate, sponsored a divestment resolution. The measure passed in a 37-2 vote last year, according to LSU\u2019s student newspaper. Though investment in fossil fuels amounts to only 2 to 3% of the endowment, it\u2019s an important philosophical step, Cerquone said. Cerquone is also troubled by the influence that industry has on the Institute for Energy Innovation and fears other corporations could control other departments\u2019 curriculums. \u201cThese entities are going to have a say in what we pay to learn here,\u201d she said. The fossil fuel industry has made forays into academia beyond Louisiana. ExxonMobil and Shell have both helped fund a similar Energy Initiative at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where the highest-level donors can have an office on MIT\u2019s campus, according to Inside Climate News. In 2021, Exxon funded and co-wrote a research paper with MIT researchers with conclusions that supported the argument for federal subsidies for carbon capture and use.

            "content": "An estimated 85,000 additional childcare places would be required by September 2025 to enable the government\u2019s planned expansion of funded childcare for working parents in England, according to the Department for Education. A pilot will explore how to repurpose unused school space to support childcare and increase capacity. If successful, the scheme will be rolled out to expand funded childcare for eligible families of children as young as nine months old. The rollout will require an estimated 40,000 additional staff, compared with 2023, the DfE said. As part of the scheme, working parents of two-year-olds have been able to access 15 hours of funded childcare this month. This will be extended to working parents of all children older than nine months from September this year, before the full rollout of 30 hours a week to all eligible families a year later. The government estimates 15,000 new childcare places will be needed for this September, with an additional 70,000 likely to be needed for September 2025 when the offer expands to 30 government-funded hours for children from nine months old to when they start school. So far nearly four in five (79%) of the codes issued to eligible parents of two-year-olds across England to secure childcare funding for this month have been validated by providers, said the DfE, with thousands more having their places confirmed over the coming weeks. The latest data, to be published on Monday, will show that 195,355 two-year-olds are already benefiting from funded places. Eligible working parents can apply regardless of whether they are in work or on parental leave. As long as a parent plans to return to work or start a new job by the end of September, they will now be able to apply for their childcare code in May at the same time as everyone else, the DfE said. The education secretary, Gillian Keegan, said: \u201cAs today\u2019s figures show, our plan is working. Thousands of parents are returning to work, and tens of thousands more will be able to do so later this year and next. Childcare expansion on this scale is unprecedented in this country, and we will continue providing maximum support to nurseries and all providers to make it a reality.\u201d Neil Leitch, the chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said: \u201cWith government admitting not only that 40,000 additional educators are required by September 2025 but also 85,000 new places, it\u2019s clear that, regardless of the positive spin government is trying to put on the current situation, the challenge facing the sector is an immense one. \u201cIf the government is to have any hope of rolling out this offer successfully in the long term, it\u2019s crucial that ministers acknowledge and tackle the fundamental issues facing nurseries, preschools and providers. Jonathan Broadbery, the director of policy and communications at the National Day Nurseries Association, said many nurseries have waiting lists. \u201cNurseries are working hard to deliver the existing offer, but creating additional places for under-twos can be very challenging. \u201cWith high staff turnover as well, it is clear that the sector will need to recruit more than the 40,000 staff needed if we are also to replace those who leave,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2024-04-11T10:30:28Z",
            "content": "After nearly two months on the run, the Amazon outlaws nicknamed Hammerhead and Armadillo might have felt they were nearing the home straight \u2013 albeit a long and muddy one. Just ahead over the Tocantins River lay the Trans-Amazonian highway, a rundown and poorly patrolled jungle track that cuts more than 1,200 miles east-west across the largest rainforest on Earth. After completing that gruelling journey, the fugitives reportedly hoped to sneak across the border into Bolivia, far from the long hand of the Brazilian law. Then, at about 1.30pm last Thursday, federal police scuttled their audacious plan, intercepting the runaways as they approached the bridge into the Amazon city of Marab\u00e1. \u201cHe panicked and started swerving all over the shop,\u201d one officer said of Hammerhead, a convicted killer whose real name is Rog\u00e9rio Mendon\u00e7a. Shots were fired. The men were captured. And one of the most dramatic manhunts in recent Brazilian history was over, 51 days after the pair had somehow broken out of a maximum-security federal prison in the north-eastern city of Mossor\u00f3. \u201cThey\u2019re going back to the place they came from,\u201d celebrated the justice minister, Ricardo Lewandowski, hailing \u201ca victory of the Brazilian state\u201d. The detention of Mendon\u00e7a and his accomplice, Deibson Nascimento, came as a relief to the Brazilian government, under intense pressure to explain how two highly dangerous felons could escape from such a supposedly secure location. But the cinematic jailbreak has also exposed how Brazil\u2019s two most powerful crime factions \u2013 Rio\u2019s Red Command (CV) and S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s First Capital Command (PCC) \u2013 have dramatically expanded their footprint in the Amazon in recent years in order to exploit drug-trafficking routes and markets and other lucrative illegal economies, including gold mining and land-grabbing. Mendon\u00e7a and Nascimento, who are members of the CV, hail from the Amazon state of Acre and were in jail there until being moved to Mossor\u00f3 after taking part in a 2023 rebellion in which five members of a rival faction were killed, three of them beheaded. Nascimento, a 33-year-old who was allegedly one of the CV\u2019s first members in Acre, was arrested in a small Amazonian border town called Brasil\u00e9ia in 2015 and was sentenced to more than 80 years in jail. His rap sheet includes trafficking, robbery and even the kidnapping of a Bolivian politician. Mendon\u00e7a, 35, who is also nicknamed Cherub, was reportedly serving a 74-year sentence for crimes including robbery and ordering the 2021 murder of a teenager on Acre\u2019s border with Amazonas state. At the time of their arrest last week, the pair were driving through another Amazon state, Par\u00e1, and had visited its state capital, Bel\u00e9m \u2013 a key CV base \u2013 after absconding hundreds of miles up Brazil\u2019s coastline in a small fishing vessel. Aiala Couto, a Bel\u00e9m-based security expert, believes the pair fled to the Amazon precisely because of the region\u2019s strategic importance to such factions. \u201cThat\u2019s why they came to Par\u00e1 after crossing four other states \u2026 Marab\u00e1 is a city where the Red Command and PCC have a presence. Before that, they came through the Mosqueiro Island and through Bel\u00e9m, which means there is an organisation that offered them support and logistics, showing once more the relationships these groups have been establishing in the Amazon region,\u201d said Couto, a researcher for the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety. Experts say the CV and PCC began advancing into the Amazon about a decade ago, with the region becoming particularly crucial to the former after the 2016 assassination of a drug trafficker on the Brazil-Paraguay border. That killing helped the PCC control the smuggling corridor focused on Brazil\u2019s midwestern border and forced the CV to look north to the Amazon. But Brazil\u2019s prison system itself has also been blamed for helping south-eastern criminal groups set up camp in the Amazon. \u201cOne of the factors that led to the expansion of these criminal organizations to other states \u2013 especially ones in the north and north-east \u2013 was the prison system, mass incarceration and the growth of the prison population; and also the transfer of prisoners from state to federal prisons,\u201d said Couto. Criminal leaders from different corners of Brazil were inadvertently united after being moved from prisons in their home states to high-security prisons elsewhere. \u201cThis led to contact between these organisations that allowed them to spread and disseminate their activities throughout Brazil,\u201d said Couto. At the same time, organisations that had previously only dominated their own states now had \u201crepresentatives\u201d in other regions, such as the Amazon. It is unclear how long Hammerhead and Armadillo spent plotting their escape. Fl\u00e1via Fr\u00f3es, a Rio-based lawyer representing the two men, told local media they decided to flee because of poor treatment. \u201cI had to escape because I was buried alive,\u201d Fr\u00f3es quoted Mendon\u00e7a as saying. The men put their plan into action at dawn on 14 February \u2013 the last day of carnival, when Brazilians are \u201cmore relaxed\u201d, the justice minister later told reporters. At the time of the jailbreak, the criminals were in neighbouring cells. One of them reportedly used a steel reinforcement bar from the wall to cut through a window, before they climbed on to the roof through a duct. There, the men found tools left by construction workers renovating part of the prison. They cut their way through the perimeter fence with a pair of pliers and fled. Guards only noticed their absence 90 minutes later. The escape triggered a huge manhunt. Hundreds of police scoured the countryside for the Amazonian escapers. \u201cIt was like some shit out of a film. Loads of helicopters. Loads of drones,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a was overheard telling his girlfriend by phone. \u201cThe [searchers] got so close to us we could smell their stinky boots.\u201d After hiding near the prison for about a month, they reached a seaside fishing community called Icapu\u00ed and sailed north for six days towards Bel\u00e9m, a city close to one of the biggest ports in the Amazon and, therefore, a key location for smugglers moving South American cocaine to Europe. From there, they were driven south by four CV associates towards Marab\u00e1, where their sensational escape would come to an abrupt end. The next day they were back in Mossor\u00f3. Hammerhead\u2019s mother, Nelita Nogueira da Silva, told local TV: \u201cThey\u2019re going to rot in jail.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-26T17:01:59Z",
            "content": "The market town of Rhayader stands at a historic crossroads at the heart of Wales. Lorries trundle through, delivery vans dart around, tourists merrily motor along. The town sits on the A470, the main route between north and south Wales, and last year had 20mph signs posted on its four main approaches. Six months later and before the possible reversal of the nationwide default speed limit policy, people still have mixed feelings. \u201cI\u2019m all for it,\u201d said Thomas Lewis Jones, who runs a hardware store on East Street. \u201cIt makes town centres infinitely safer. I have a seven-year-old son learning to ride a bike. Of course you want people going slower. It only takes seconds longer to go through the town at 20 rather than 30.\u201d The Labour-led Welsh government announced this week that hundreds of roads that were changed to 20mph could be returned to 30mph during a major review after almost half a million people signed a petition calling for the policy to be scrapped. As well as champions, there are many opponents in Rhayader. \u201cIt\u2019s crap,\u201d said Gwyn Evans, an 80-year-old retired electrical engineer. \u201cThey\u2019ve spent millions on it. That\u2019s money that should be spent on the NHS or schools.\u201d Father and son David and Tom Jones, who work at the 100-year-old family-run ET James petrol station and garage, said most of their customers hated it. \u201cThe problem is, the speed limit changes every few miles and it\u2019s not slowing people down,\u201d said Tom. Rhys Thomas, the mayor of Rhayader \u2013 which bills itself as the outdoors capital of Wales \u2013 said: \u201cIt was evident that a 20mph suits-all option was not the correct one. \u201cIn areas such as heavy pedestrian zones, schools and gathering places \u2026 it is the right to have 20mph limits but we welcome the decision to re-look at all areas.\u201d This is the position taken by the AA. Jack Cousens, head of roads policy, said 20mph tends to works best on streets with community assets such as schools, surgeries and local shops. \u201cThe concern held by some is that a wider, far-reaching zone dilutes its effect on reducing speed in the area it is trying to protect,\u201d he said. The question now is whether Wales\u2019s move signals that the UK has reached peak 20mph, and if the policy could be reversed elsewhere. This is arguably most pressing in Scotland, where the government is working to implement 20mph by 2025. A Transport Scotland spokesperson affirmed it is \u201ccommitted\u201d to doing so, and that Wales\u2019s decision would not influence its timetable. Joanne Leach, a researcher at the University of Birmingham, said that although other places are unlikely to replicate Wales\u2019s approach, there will continue to be a broader push to reduce reliance on cars. \u201cMy sense is that we aren\u2019t going to be speeding up, generally speaking. All of the indicators coming through is it\u2019s about managing vehicles, either slowing them down or removing them entirely from the road.\u201d She expected that other areas would learn lessons from Wales\u2019s experience, and adopt a bespoke, place-based approach in smaller geographical areas, done in consultation with the local community, rather than a blanket country-wide policy. Evidence on the impact of 20mph zones is conflicting. \u201cIt\u2019s not terribly conclusive, it depends where you did your study and when,\u201d said Leach. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been in long enough in Wales to do a proper assessment of whether it has a significant impact.\u201d Around schools or areas with lots of parked cars and people crossing roads, there is a \u201cdefinite and clear benefit\u201d, Leach said. In other areas, it can increase accidents because slower speeds can lead to greater driver distraction, she said. Research suggests that since 20mph limits were implemented in Edinburgh, the number of collisions in one year fell by 40%, including 23% fewer deaths and 33% fewer serious injuries. In Belfast, the introduction of 20mph made no difference, although the research was done on a very small section of roads. Rebecca Guy, senior policy manager at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (Rospa), said that, depending on their age, victims are seven times more likely to survive road accidents at 20mph compared with 30mph. \u201cAlmost 30,000 people were killed or seriously injured on the UK\u2019s roads in 2022, and statistics show that government has taken its foot off the gas when it comes to road safety, leaving us with a decade of minimal progress,\u201d she said, noting that England is the only UK nation without a road safety strategy. There are also environmental reasons for 20mph, which can improve air quality by reducing particulate levels, according to Imperial College research. Yet in some areas it can elevate pollution; driving at 20mph down a steep hill means that drivers must brake the whole way down, while some buses and older vehicles run less efficiently at 20mph. There has been local grassroots opposition, including online petitions garnering thousands of signatories, to 20mph in various places, but there is no big campaign to reverse 20mph outside Wales, said Robert Bull, chair of the Alliance of British Drivers. Bull is based in Bristol, a city with lots of 20mph zones, where he said motorists had initially been unhappy with the policy\u2019s introduction. \u201cThey\u2019ve not made peace with it, but they\u2019ve accepted it because what can you do? It\u2019s difficult to change when it\u2019s done.\u201d He said a perception remained among motorists that 20mph is ideological and not-evidence based. \u201cIt\u2019s money wasted that could have been better spent on other road safety activities.\u201d Charles Musselwhite, a professor at Aberystwyth University, said evidence suggests that people get used to 20mph speed limits over time. This is because transport interventions typically follow a \u201chype cycle\u201d: a proposed idea garners growing support, which falls as the detail emerges, then returns after implementation. Welsh government-commissioned research suggests 80% were in favour of 20mph limits in 2021, although this fell to 63% in 2022. A YouGov poll of UK adults in 2022 showed more in favour than against 20mph in urban areas (48% v 39%). Musselwhite said: \u201cWhat we see in Wales is that most people are not opposed to 20mph speed limits at all, but a loud, vocal minority are, and we expect support to grow as people realise the benefits. \u201cBut it needs a government willing to stand its ground in the face of negative opinion just after implementation, as we are seeing now.\u201d"

            "title": "Is Shell trying to kill the London stock market?",
            "date": "2024-04-11T04:00:22Z",
            "content": "Last July, Wael Sawan, the chief executive of Shell, told the BBC about the terrific time he had on a visit to the New York stock exchange. The welcome was \u201cexemplary\u201d, he enthused, and the locals even flew the Shell flag next to their own. \u201cThey [the NYSE officials] said we continue to value a company that provides us the energy we desperately need,\u201d he continued, adding that he wouldn\u2019t rule out moving Shell\u2019s stock market listing to the US in time, an inflammatory suggestion given the general angst over the state of the London market. Now he\u2019s at it again. In remarks to Bloomberg published this week, he said Shell had \u201ca location\u201d \u2013 meaning London \u2013 \u201cthat clearly seems to be undervalued\u201d. His beef is the perceived undervaluation of Shell\u2019s shares versus those of New York-listed rivals Chevron and ExxonMobil. If the valuation gap doesn\u2019t close, \u201cwe have to look at all options. All options,\u201d he emphasised. For good measure, his predecessor as chief executive, Ben van Beurden, joined the grumbling, telling an FT conference this week that Shell is \u201cmassively undervalued\u201d in London and that deeper pools of capital in the US, higher valuations and the \u201cmore positive\u201d attitudes of investors \u201cconspire\u201d against all European energy companies. \u201cSomething will have to give,\u201d opined Van Beurden. This is starting to sound like a campaign to create an air of inevitability around a switch to the US. Or, if it isn\u2019t that, Shell\u2019s top operatives seem transfixed by the notion that a relisting will cure all their troubles. It\u2019s their job to fret about the share price, but it\u2019s hard to overstate how detrimental this is for the London Stock Exchange. The biggest company on the market is openly threatening to leave. That is a different order of seriousness than seeing Flutter, Ferguson and CRH flee to the US. If Shell goes, who\u2019s next? Glencore? Even BP? But here\u2019s one basic question about Sawan\u2019s thesis: is it even correct? Does the undervaluation, in terms of earnings and cashflow multiples, exist solely by virtue of the fact that Shell is listed in London? One doubts the story is as simple as that. It\u2019s not as if US investors currently have any difficulty buying shares in Shell, whether directly or through American depositary receipts. On the company\u2019s own numbers, 45% of its institutional register is already American versus 29% from the UK. Unlike Ferguson or CRH, there seems to be no difficulty getting noticed by American money. That is hardly surprising: we are talking here about a \u00a3180bn company. It seems unlikely the market would leave a 25% discount, which seems to be Shell\u2019s rough current analysis, on the table unless other factors were at work. The real explanation, perhaps, is that the stock market (sadly) is deeply sceptical about the pace of energy transition and the returns on capital in renewables. Thus, the most oily firms, such the two US titans, are prized over those with a sideline in renewables, such as Shell, which in turn is valued more highly than those with a slightly greener hue, such as BP. This price signal is terrifying from a climate perspective, but the point is that a mere relisting of Shell\u2019s shares wouldn\u2019t change the make-up of its assets. Maybe Sawan would like to water down further Shell\u2019s emission-reduction targets and thinks it would be easier to do so from the US. But if that\u2019s the case, he should say so openly. There is a strong whiff here that what Shell and Sawan really dislike is the climate policies of European governments. That is a separate argument to the questionable claim that the same earnings are valued wildly differently in different markets. The London Stock Exchange gets a lot of flak, including from this column, for its seeming lack of concern about departees and the lack of new arrivals. But on this occasion, one can feel some sympathy. Shell \u2013 possibly the most liquid, deeply researched and widely owned stock in town \u2013 seems to have alighted on the \u201cundervaluation\u201d theme without showing evidence that location is the problem in its case. In the LSE\u2019s shoes, you\u2019d be furious. Shell\u2019s loose \u201cmaybe we will, maybe we won\u2019t\u201d talk is seriously damaging."

Ofsted\u2019s registers show a fall in early years places every year since 2016: 17,800 places were lost in the year to November 2023 alone. As usual with the Conservatives\u2019 un-evidenced policies, blunt truth eventually hits them on the head. The Department for Education just confessed that it needs 85,000 more nursery places and 40,000 more staff to be able to meet its target of expanding 30 free hours to children aged nine months by September 2025. In an acute recruitment crisis, nursery work is on the Sun\u2019s list of the UK\u2019s most unpopular jobs. Neil Leitch, head of the Early Years Alliance, told me: \u201cPretending things are resolved is at best unhelpful and at worst shameful.\u201d The Alliance represents 14,000 nursery providers, and runs 41 not-for-profit nurseries, often in deprived areas. \u201cAll of them could accommodate more children if we could find appropriately skilled staff,\u201d he says, but so many leave due to exhaustion and low pay. On Monday the government boasted that 195,355 two-year-olds already have funded places. This is good news, except there are more than 600,000 two-year-olds in England, according to the latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics. On Wednesday, expect a devastating report from the National Audit Office: no one thinks there will be places for all children aged nine months to five years to get those 30 free hours a week. Credit where it\u2019s due: austerity Tories have vastly expanded the early years promise. But the chancellor pulled it out of his hat for the 2023 budget, after no consultation with thunder-struck nursery providers. Tories copying popular Labour policies is a good idea, lacking their own. Astonishingly, a government cutting everything will pay for 80% of \u201cchildcare\u201d in England (I\u2019ll come back to that word). But where are the places? They claim that 79% of two-year-olds whose parents applied in time for 31 March have received \u201ccode validation\u201d and can claim a place with a childcare provider. But many have no place, says Labour: they are on waiting lists, and some deprived areas are nursery \u201cdeserts\u201d. Last year, Labour said there were two children for every place in England. At the same time, the stipulated ratio of staff to two-year-olds was eased from 1:4 to 1:5. The government calls it \u201cchildcare\u201d as its stated aim is \u201cto support increased parental engagement in the labour market\u201d: the OBR estimates 60,000 more parents will enter work. More GDP growth and less need for universal credit are good motives, but only up to a point. Listen to the language: the Tory \u201cchildcare\u201d policy is about warehousing children, while a more forward-thinking policy would land on nursery education, which transforms a child\u2019s whole life. This \u201cchildcare\u201d also means only two-year-olds with working parents qualify, widening the social gulf: children most in need of a good nursery are the poorest, and most likely to have addicted, mentally ill or out-of-work parents. Add in the tens of thousands of migrant children, whose parents have \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d, who are denied equal nursery provision. The shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has made early years a Labour priority. She plans \u201cseamless support from the end of parental leave to the end of primary school\u201d \u2013 and now the Tories are trying to cut in on Labour\u2019s idea. Free breakfast clubs for all primaries in England is a first step in her vision of wraparound support for children, with a mental health counsellor in every secondary school. She plans nurseries embedded inside the education system, within primary schools with spare space as their numbers are falling. Remember, the government had banned councils from providing nurseries out of pure ideology, demanding that all must be private. Labour says the government, panicking at the lack of places, recently lifted that ban and now adopt the Phillipson plan: councils can open maintained nurseries and place them inside state schools. Tories are about to seize another longtime Phillipson policy too: Ofsted may ditch its brutal one-word judgments for a more rounded opinion on schools and nurseries. If Sunak wants to steal more of Labour\u2019s popular policies, why not scrap VAT relief for private schools to fund extra state school teachers? YouGov finds 71% support that, just 19% against. To see how a better early years model might develop, take a visit to St Stephen\u2019s combined nursery, children\u2019s centre and primary school in one of the poorest districts of Newham, east London. Like its nursery, its primary school just got yet another glowing report from Ofsted about every aspect, reporting that \u201cby the end of Year 1, the vast majority of pupils are fluent readers\u201d. St Stephen\u2019s takes children from babyhood \u2013 91% of whom don\u2019t have English as their first language, a third on free school meals, and many with special educational needs and disabilities \u2013 and nurtures them to remarkable results at age 11, Neena Lall OBE, dynamo headteacher for over 20 years, told me. \u201cThat\u2019s because we have them and their families all the way through,\u201d she said. She shows lists of daily events for parents, from English for Speakers of Other Languages (Esol) to zumba, a food bank and cost-of-living advice, sessions supporting parents to play, cook and read with children, careers and training advice, health visitor and midwife sessions, with stay-and-play for timid new mothers to meet. St Stephen\u2019s was built as a Sure Start, and some councils managed to keep a few others going when most were wrecked after 2010. Lall juggles her budgets but things are getting very tight, with funding cuts and rising teachers\u2019 pay. Sure Starts were rarely integrated into schools. Phillipson\u2019s plan looks more like the St Stephen\u2019s model, placing nurseries into seamless babyhood-to-11-year-old education. Labour refuses to use the Sure Start label for fear it suggests uncounted spending, but David Bell, a former chief inspector at Ofsted, is drawing up a report for them on the future of early years: it may look something like this. However, waiting for a costed plan leaves it open to wild attacks, like the one from Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, in a BBC Breakfast interview with Sally Nugent: \u201cThe thing that is most going to impact this system rollout is if Labour got into power because they\u2019ve said they will not continue with childcare.\u201d Nugent called it out, as presenters should do more often: \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d Labour\u2019s policy will provide more, not less, than the present inadequate nursery places \u2013 and its prime purpose will not be warehousing, but best education.

Quaker, a Cavalry black, and a grey horse called Vida were seen galloping through the streets of the capital after being frightened by builders moving rubble last Wednesday. The pair bolted while they were on an extended exercise in Belgravia with five other horses and six soldiers from the Household Cavalry. Four service personnel were thrown from their horses and five of the animals got loose, colliding with vehicles including a double-decker bus, and causing a number of injuries. The army said that Vida, who was seen covered in blood, \u201cremains under close and careful professional veterinary observation\u201d. On Monday, it posted on social media that Quaker has \u201cshown significant improvement and progresses towards what is expected to be a full recovery\u201d. The update posted to X said: \u201cThe other horse, Vida, a grey, continues to make progress. He remains under close and careful professional veterinary observation as his wounds heal. \u201cWe are so thankful for everyone\u2019s concern and expressions of support, and for all those involved in their care.\u201d The army spokesperson added: \u201cOf the soldiers injured, two are still undergoing treatment in hospital but will make a full recovery. \u201cThe remainder have returned to work.\u201d He added: \u201cHealing takes time \u2013 please be patient as we support that process. The soldiers and horses are all receiving the very best of care.\u201d Ambulance crews treated four people in three separate incidents in Buckingham Palace Road, Belgrave Square and at the junction of Chancery Lane and Fleet Street in the space of 10 minutes. The incident began near Buckingham Palace Road where witnesses saw a serviceman thrown from his horse and one of the loose animals careered into a taxi waiting outside the Clermont Hotel, shattering its windows. Two horses were then seen running in the road near Aldwych, one of which appeared to be covered in blood, which the army said was \u201cconsistent with lacerations\u201d. The animals were later seen near the Limehouse Tunnel before they were recaptured by City of London police and taken away to be assessed by army vets."

            "content": "As Rafael Nadal continues to build the physical robustness, intensity and form required to be competitive over five sets against the best players in the world at the French Open, he took another step forward in his comeback by holding firm in a nervy, turbulent contest to reach the fourth round of the Madrid Open with a 6-1, 6-7 (5), 6-3 win over Pedro Cach\u00edn of Argentina. Having started the tournament with ample uncertainty after mostly being off the tour for the past 18 months due to various injuries, Nadal continues to make clear progress. Two days after seeing off Alex de Minaur, the 10th seed, in the second round, Nadal maintained his intensity across a three-hour, four-minute battle with Cach\u00edn, the world No 91, and he elevated his level in the decisive moment of the third set. \u201cThree and a half weeks ago, I was in Manacor almost unable to get out and move, losing to the guys from the academy day after day,\u201d said Nadal. \u201cNow I\u2019m with the guys on the tour again. And winning. There is progress, and it has to be valued positively, no matter how small. Although I am in a different situation in my career, I think I have built it by valuing small improvements. I am trying to go through this process again even though it is a much more complicated task.\u201d With all men\u2019s fourth-round matches played on Tuesday, Nadal faces another significant challenge as he tries to recover to face Jiri Lehecka, a talented 22-year-old Czech seeded 30th, at 10pm local time. Nadal says that his body feels fine, in contrast to his three-set match against Jordan Thompson in January, which led to another three-month lay off. Still, he will have to wait and see how he feels in the morning. \u201cI don\u2019t have that negative feeling now like I had in that moment, but nobody knows what can happen during the night and how I wake up tomorrow morning,\u201d said Nadal. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the truth, no? I\u2019m not saying that because I\u2019m trying to protect myself. I am talking with my heart and saying exactly the feelings that I have right now. Let\u2019s wait for tomorrow. I hope nothing happens, and I hope to be on court tomorrow.\u201d Casper Ruud, the fifth seed, ended 29th seed Cameron Norrie\u2019s hopes of a deep run in Madrid, winning 6-2, 6-4 on Monday night. In the women\u2019s draw, Iga Swiatek, the top seed, dominated the home favourite Sara Sorribes Tormo 6-1, 6-0 to reach the quarter-finals and the in-form fourth seed Elena Rybakina eased past Sara Bejlek 6-1, 6-3."

            "date": "2024-04-01T12:00:06Z",
            "content": "The Conservatives have been accused of failing to live up to their ambitious agenda for Britain\u2019s regions, as Guardian analysis shows no progress has been made on half of their levelling up targets. The analysis of the 12 targets set by Michael Gove in his 2022 levelling up white paper shows there has been no progress in six of them, including three where evidence suggests things have got worse. These include education, skills and wellbeing, which have stagnated, and local pride, housing and health, which have deteriorated in the last two years. The findings are further evidence of how far ministers have fallen short of the lofty goals set out by Boris Johnson earlier this parliament, when he promised to raise living standards and close Britain\u2019s yawning regional equality gap. Labour is seeking to put that failure at the heart of its local election campaign, with Keir Starmer accusing the government of having \u201cstrangled levelling up at birth\u201d. The Guardian analysis is the first in a series looking at how the Conservatives\u2019 flagship post-Brexit growth programme was derailed by a mix of political turmoil, pork barrel politics and Whitehall interference. Jack Shaw, a fellow at the Bennett Institute for Public Policy, said: \u201cDespite the government\u2019s rhetoric, this data shows that it\u2019s failing to turn the tide on regional inequalities. For too many families, that means living unhealthier lives with inadequate access to transport infrastructure and employment.\u201d Michael Heseltine, the former cabinet minister and long-time champion of regional development, warned that some of the levelling up funds appeared to have been used as political tools to win votes in certain seats in the north. \u201cThe British economy needs a shot in the arm and the only way to get that economy moving is to create a partnership with the people in the local area and know what strengths and weaknesses they have got,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have got to involve the people you are trying to help and not just send them Christmas presents every so often.\u201d John Stevenson, the Tory MP who chairs the party\u2019s Northern Research Group, said the varying outcomes were evidence of his party\u2019s fluctuating focus on the north in particular. \u201cThe truth [is] the government\u2019s commitment to the north has ebbed and flowed,\u201d he said. \u201cAt times it\u2019s been full on, but at other times it\u2019s been lukewarm.\u201d Angela Rayner, the shadow levelling up secretary, told the Guardian: \u201cLevelling up hasn\u2019t really delivered because the projects have been gimmicks. They\u2019re not really addressing some of the fundamental issues that towns and cities across the country face.\u201d The government denied that its agenda had fallen flat. A spokesperson for the levelling up department said: \u201cLevelling up is an ambitious long-term programme of reform and by sticking to the plan we are making significant progress against our missions.\u201d Johnson first started talking about his levelling up agenda before the 2019 election, with the Tory manifesto promising to close the gap between London and the rest of the country. However Covid delayed much of the implementation of the project, which only crystallised in 2022 when Gove set out his vision for how to stimulate growth across the country in his levelling up white paper. In that paper, the levelling up secretary said: \u201cWhile talent is distributed evenly across the UK, opportunity is not. For many, if you want to get on you need to get out. Levelling up is a mission \u2013 part economic, part social, part moral \u2013 to change that for good.\u201d Since then however, implementation of the programme has struggled to live up to Gove\u2019s powerful rhetoric. Ministers repeatedly delayed the second round of bidding for the flagship \u00a34.8bn levelling up fund, before changing the rules on how the money was to be allocated even after bids had been submitted. A recent report from the public accounts committee found only 10% of the \u00a310bn allocated for levelling up had been spent, while 80% of the projects that received money early in the process were due to miss their deadline of completion by the end of March. The Guardian\u2019s analysis of the progress made in the 12 missions set out by Gove in 2022 gives further evidence of the failures of the project so far. They include health, where data from the Office for National Statistics shows that the average healthy life that a child can expect when they are born \u2013 the metric identified in the levelling up white paper \u2013 has been getting steadily shorter for the past decade. Furthermore, the gap between the north-east, where life expectancies are at their lowest, and the south-east, is growing. Local pride also seems to be falling. The government\u2019s community life survey found 76% of people felt satisfied with the area where they live in May 2023 \u2013 down from 79% in 2020-21. In housing, the number of first-time buyers has fallen over the last few years, while the number of homes falling short of being classified as \u201cdecent\u201d has risen. In some of the government\u2019s target areas, things have improved, albeit in patches. They include crime, which has improved in parts of the UK but not in others, and living standards, where wages are finally beginning to outstrip inflation. Wage growth is now higher in Yorkshire and the north-west than it is in London and the south-east, while the gap between employment in London and employment in the north-east reduced by 3% between May 2022 and May 2023. The one area in which the government has made good progress is in devolving powers, thanks to a series of devolution deals signed since 2022, including a new mayor in the east Midlands and new powers for existing mayors. A spokesperson for the department said: \u201cIn 2010, there was no devolution in England beyond the M25 and now almost two-thirds of the country is covered by devolution deals \u2013 including 90% of the north \u2013 with more to come.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-15T11:06:42Z",
            "content": "It was easy to fear the worst when Evan Ndicka fell. The Roma defender was away from the play, with no opponents in his immediate vicinity, as he doubled over and then collapsed with a hand on his chest. Twelve years to the day after another footballer, Piermario Morosini, died after suffering cardiac arrest during a Serie B match, the dread of a possible repeat was immediate and overwhelming. Daniele De Rossi was one of the first to see what happened, turning and yelling for the medical team. Roma\u2019s goalkeeper, Mile Svilar, and an opponent, the Udinese striker Lorenzo Lucca, were quickest to reach Ndicka and by their gestures confirmed that urgent treatment was required. Others signalled for quiet from the crowd and fans at the Bluenergy Stadium swiftly acquiesced. A defibrillator was brought on but not used. Ndicka gave a thumbs-up as he was carried off on a stretcher, an encouraging sign, but nobody yet knew what had caused his collapse, nor if the danger had passed. The referee, Luca Pairetto, paused the game while De Rossi followed Ndicka down into the changing room. Eventually, the Roma manager re-emerged, speaking with his Udinese counterpart Gabriele Cioffi as well as Pairetto. The game had been stopped for close to 10 minutes at this point, and all parties agreed they were happy to respect the wishes of Ndicka\u2019s teammates regarding any resumption. De Rossi spoke to his players, who indicated that they were not in the right frame of mind to continue. Supporters responded respectfully to an announcement that the game would be suspended. There had been jeers when Livorno\u2019s match against Pescara was stopped after Morosini fell in 2012, before fans knew the player had passed away. His death left an indelible mark on Italian football, but the sport has known other high-profile incidents globally since, including the cardiac arrest suffered by Christian Eriksen while playing for Denmark at Euro 2020. Ndicka does not appear to have suffered the same condition. Initial tests at the stadium were inconclusive, but he was transported to the nearby Santa Maria della Misericordia University Hospital and the news agency Ansa cited medical professionals close to the situation on Sunday night as confirming that Ndicka did not experience a cardiac arrest. At time of writing, no official diagnosis has been made public. La Gazzetta dello Sport reported on Monday that pulmonary symptoms were the \u201cmore probable\u201d cause of Ndicka\u2019s apparent chest pain. He had received a strong elbow to the chest from Lucca late in the first half and been involved in a pair of less violent tussles with opponents shortly before his collapse. The most important thing is that he recovers fully. Roma published a photo on Sunday evening of Ndicka sitting up in his hospital bed and flexing a bicep. \u201cEvan is feeling better and is in good spirits,\u201d read the club\u2019s social media post, confirming that team-mates had been along to see him. \u201cHe will remain in the hospital for further observations. Forza Evan!\u201d No schedule can yet be confirmed for when Sunday\u2019s match will be completed. It was 1-1 when Ndicka fell, Roberto Pereyra putting Udinese on top in the first half before Romelu Lukaku equalised midway through the second. The game will be resumed from the 78th minute, when it was paused, rather than replayed in its entirety. Managers are not obliged to use the same 11 who were on the pitch at the time of the interruption (as well as anything, injuries could happen in the meantime) but will only be permitted to call on players who were eligible to feature on Sunday and cannot use anyone who had already been substituted. Serie A\u2019s rules state that a game suspended in this manner should typically be completed the following day, but an exception is made if either team is competing in a midweek round. Roma have the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final against Milan coming up on Thursday, and travelled back to the capital on Sunday night. The scheduling of the final part of their game with Udinese may be impacted by whether they progress to the semis. These events have already highlighted a lack of clarity in some regulations. Earlier this month, two Serie D teams \u2013 Palmese and Manfredonia \u2013 were punished with an assigned defeat and one-point penalty for having their match stopped when a fan was taken seriously ill in the stands. There does not appear to be any risk of similar judgments in this situation. For those who remember the grim and chaotic circumstances around Morosini\u2019s passing, when stadium workers had to frantically push away a car obstructing the ambulance\u2019s access to the pitch, the clear positives from Sunday were the rapid response of the medical team and the immediate willingness of all parties to respect the participants\u2019 wishes by stopping the game. Both Roma and Udinese have important targets left to aim for this season. The Giallorossi are fifth in the table and chasing Champions League qualification through the conventional path while also competing to win the Europa League. Udinese, 15th and just one point above the relegation zone, were on course for a valuable draw. Some things, though, are more important. Ndicka has had an excellent year on a professional level, winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast in February as well as joining Roma last summer and becoming a regular starter under first Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and now De Rossi. But the happiest moment for many who have enjoyed watching him was simply to see him sitting up and smiling in a bed on Sunday night."

            "date": "2024-04-28T11:00:04Z",
            "content": "The question \u201cwhat if?\u201d plagues Smera Chohan and her husband, Sajjad Butt. Last July, Chohan had just posed for a photograph with their eight-year-old daughter, Nuria, at her school picnic in Wimbledon when a Land Rover crashed through a fence and ploughed into them. Nuria Sajjad and her friend Selena Lau were ultimately killed by the collision while Chohan was left with 10 broken bones and the overwhelming grief of losing her only child. Slow progress in the police investigation means that 10 months after the girls\u2019 deaths, their families still have no answers as to what happened. Speaking at their home in south-west London, Nuria\u2019s father said: \u201cIn the absence of concrete answers, in the absence of steps moving forward, we\u2019re left to ponder this \u2018what if?\u2019 \u2013 and the \u2018what ifs\u2019, they crush you.\u201d This week it was reported that the Metropolitan police force has been unable to progress its investigation further because of a chronic shortage of specialist forensic investigators. The Guardian understands that there were about 40 specialist forensic collision investigators in the Met in 2010 \u2013 but now the number is down to 11, with another 17 in training. The apparent stagnation of the Wimbledon crash investigation has only made it harder for the families affected. A woman was arrested last year on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and released under investigation. No decision has been made on whether any charges should be brought. The alternative scenarios that day haunt Nuria\u2019s parents. They have a photo of Chohan and Nuria standing on the grass outside the Study preparatory school and another in front of the building, both taken within the same minute. \u201cI question myself that had I just stayed in the grassy patch, the outcome would have been different, right? There are so many things that are \u2018if only\u2019. If only it was raining that day \u2026\u201d Chohan said, before Butt finished the sentence: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have been outside, we would have been in the hall.\u201d The families\u2019 lawyer, Trevor Sterling, said delays to investigations came at a high psychological price: \u201cYou need to have the facts so that you can rationally say to yourself, \u2018Of course there was nothing more I could do\u2019 \u2026 PTSD and the psychological impact is only made worse in the absence of the evidence, the facts, the answers.\u201d In a letter to Sterling, the Met commissioner, Mark Rowley, said the force was facing a shortage of specialist forensic collision investigators. Rowley said the case had not progressed further because the police were waiting for specialists to finish a report on the incident. Sterling believes the shortage in experts needs to be tackled urgently. \u201cDelay itself causes prejudice and injustice. This isn\u2019t a one-off, this is a wider problem that needs to be fixed,\u201d he said. Mark Crouch, who chairs the Institute of Traffic Accident Investigators, worked in the Met before moving into private forensic collision investigation. He said that in around 2010 there were about 40 specialist investigators but the number \u201cwas slowly dwindling\u201d by the time he left in 2016 and the crisis had \u201cbeen coming for a long time\u201d. Crouch said the shortage of specialist investigators had come at the same time as the workload for each case had increased because of advances in car technology and CCTV as well as an increase in regulation. In addition to causing delays in investigating fatal cases, Crouch said that in many serious injury cases, \u201cspecialist units aren\u2019t going out and collecting the evidence\u201d, making it harder for victims to get justice. \u201cThere are people that can never walk again or in a vegetative state that don\u2019t get any help at all, because evidence wasn\u2019t gathered,\u201d he said. Nick Simmons, the chief executive of RoadPeace, which campaigns on behalf of collision victims, said its helpline was increasingly hearing from crash victims frustrated by the lack of appropriate forensic investigations. \u201cIt is clear there is a real shortage of resources across the UK and that an already devastating experience is somehow made worse by victims not being able to seek justice,\u201d he said. Nuria\u2019s father believes it is \u201cgrossly unacceptable\u201d that there appears to have been no resolution over several years to the shortage of forensic specialists, and feels that \u201cnobody should have to suffer this\u201d. But ultimately, Butt is less interested in the reasons for the delay than in the investigation concluding. \u201cI just want justice for our girl,\u201d he said. Their home was still full of the accoutrements of childhood: a trampoline, climbing frame and swing sat in the garden unused, and an edition of the school\u2019s newsletter sat on the coffee table. Photographs of Nuria were everywhere and much of the house was as she left it \u2013 right down to the birthday presents she was saving, kept safely in a cupboard. Chohan was chair of the parent-teacher association at the school, and the couple say the support from fellow pupils\u2019 families has been \u201ctruly amazing\u201d. Nuria\u2019s friends still visit, but her parents are struggling to adjust to a world without their daughter in it. \u201cI still go to the mums\u2019 coffee morning,\u201d Chohan said, her face suddenly crumpling as she added: \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not a mum any more.\u201d Butt was quick to counter her, saying softly: \u201cYou\u2019ll always be a mum.\u201d After the interview, Chohan headed to the gym for physiotherapy. After four operations and hard work she has gone from using a wheelchair to having most of her mobility restored. Her next hurdles are psychological. She has not yet been able to face going back to the school, but is steeling herself to try in July. \u201cI plan to go back on the anniversary to claim my happy space back. That\u2019s part of my own healing journey. That\u2019s where Nuria was the happiest and that was where she smiled for the last time in her life.\u201d DCS Clair Kelland, who is in charge of policing for south-west London, said: \u201cThis was a tragic incident and we understand that the families want and need answers as to what happened.\u201d She said specialist detectives had established the circumstances, and advice had been obtained from the Crown Prosecution Service. The force was now providing specialist support and updating the families on the investigation where possible, including why \u201cone specific issue\u201d had been delayed due to a lack of specialist investigators. She added: \u201cWe recognise that the time taken has caused further distress but it is only right and fair to all involved that we carry out a thorough and extensive investigation.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-02T11:38:13Z",
            "content": "A couple of weeks ago, Carla Ward, the manager of Aston Villa, was taking part in a documentary about mums in football. \u201cI\u2019ve got a four-year-old little girl, and all she talks about is what she sees,\u201d Ward says. \u201cShe loves to tell everyone that her mum is the manager of Aston Villa.\u201d During filming, the documentary makers asked her daughter what she wanted to be when she was older. Her response? A football manager. \u201cThey said: \u2018Why?\u2019 She said: \u2018Because I see my mummy doing it,\u2019\u201d Ward recalls. As one of just five female managers in the 12 Women\u2019s Super League clubs, it\u2019s important for Ward to be visible on a personal level. \u201cYou think to yourself: the more that these young girls can see it, the more they can believe that they can go and do it. And I\u2019m massive on that.\u201d Despite the rapid growth of the women\u2019s game in recent years, there is a noticeable lack of female managers and coaches in the upper echelons of the game. At the Women\u2019s World Cup last year, only 12 of the 32 head coaches were women. While there have been interim appointments, a female coach has yet to be appointed a permanent manager in the men\u2019s professional game. Last month, Emma Hayes, who has led Chelsea to four consecutive WSL titles, described the lack of female coaches as a \u201cmassive issue\u201d, telling the BBC: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of work to do to close that gap.\u201d For Ward, female coaches are out there \u2013 the issue is they aren\u2019t being given the chance to shoot their shot. \u201cBeing in the game myself, I know there\u2019s plenty of females out there that are good enough, but it\u2019s that opportunity. I think people need to maybe open the door.\u201d While Ward stresses that she is \u201cvery big on the right person for the right job\u201d, she adds: \u201cVisibility is key. And how do we get that visibility? I\u2019m not sure. But certainly, at the minute, I think there are a lot of missed opportunities with how clubs are maybe recruiting.\u201d In the Women\u2019s Championship the figures are more promising: six out of 12 managers are women. Among them is former professional player Remi Allen, who was appointed head coach of London City Lionesses in early March. For Allen, things are starting to change but there is still work to be done. \u201cI feel like it has to be the best person for the job,\u201d says Allen, echoing Ward. \u201cIn the past, definitely, 100%, women haven\u2019t been getting a look in or have been penalised for being a woman, [and] I think it\u2019s gradually starting to change. But we need more, we absolutely need more.\u201d Like Ward, Allen says female coaches need more ways to get their foot in the door. \u201cThere are absolutely a lot of females out there who I know, who are incredible coaches, who aren\u2019t getting the opportunities.\u201d Still, the wheels are in motion. In December, the FA reported that, between October 2021 and October 2023, there was an 83% increase in the number of female coaches with Level 1 qualifications and above. Governing bodies also have several programmes aimed at increasing the number of female coaches. The England manager, Sarina Wiegman, is among 10 elite women coaches taking part in a Uefa mentoring scheme aimed at increasing the number of top female coaches. Allen herself speaks highly of taking part in the FA\u2019s England elite coach programme, where she worked as an assistant coach for the under-23 Lionesses. Sexism, however, remains rife in the women\u2019s game \u2013 and coaching is no exception. Last month, a survey by Kick It Out revealed that four in five female football coaches reported experiencing sexism in a coaching environment. For Allen, who previously played for Aston Villa, Leicester and Reading, the survey findings are \u201cfrustrating\u201d. She says: \u201cIt\u2019s been my whole career, like you see it all the time \u2026 I do feel clubs are now starting to implement things so that doesn\u2019t happen. But my thing is that there needs to be a strong stance, because there\u2019s no way a female should be going into work and experiencing that.\u201d Later this year, NewCo will take over the top two tiers of the English women\u2019s game, and Allen is urging the independent body to invest in female coaches. For Allen, the first-hand experience of many female coaches in the women\u2019s game means they have a lot to bring to the table. \u201cWe understand the women\u2019s game, because we\u2019ve lived it, breathed it and gone through the ups and downs of it,\u201d she says. Ward, meanwhile, wants to keep up the progress. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this, trying to fight and push the women\u2019s game forward,\u201d she says. \u201cSo of course there\u2019s going to be sexism, there still is, but us that are in these positions have to keep shouting, have to keep fighting and making sure that we remove dinosaurs, as I would call them.\u201d Get in touch If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email moving.goalposts@theguardian.com.

            "date": "2024-04-30T12:30:26Z",
            "content": "Foreign investment approvals will be made quicker but greater scrutiny will be placed on potential risks as Australia tries to balance economic and security interests, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will say on Wednesday. The Treasury will set a target to process half of foreign investment cases needing approval within 30 days from next January, Chalmers will tell the Lowy Institute in Sydney. It will also seek more funds from abroad to support so-called build-to-rent housing ventures and the energy transition away from fossil fuels. The budget will also set aside more funds to screen foreign investments in critical infrastructure, minerals and technology. Projects involving sensitive datasets and those to be located near defence sites will also be examined more closely \u201cto ensure that all risks are identified, understood and can be managed\u201d, he will say, according to a copy of his speech. In an interview with the ABC\u2019s 7.30 program on Tuesday, Chalmers denied the foreign investment reforms were at odds with comments by the trade minister, Don Farrell, in November that Australia was not proposing any changes regarding Chinese investment in critical minerals. Chalmers said even after the changes, Australia\u2019s foreign investment regime would remain \u201cnon-discriminatory\u201d, with the same rules applying regardless of the source country. He said Australia welcomed investment that met the national interest and proposals must be screened \u201crobustly\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In his speech, Chalmers will say that the nation is facing challenges \u201cvastly different\u201d from a decade ago. These are marked by \u201cheightened geostrategic competition, an international system under continuous pressure, demographic change, greater risk of major shocks to supply chains, and a restructuring of global trade from the net zero transformation\u201d. Australia\u2019s economy has long relied on foreign investment to bolster the economy even as domestic sources, such as the $3.7tn superannuation industry, continue to grow. Competition for funds and technology is likely to intensify as governments such as the US and Europe stump up many billions of dollars to foster decarbonisation industries including batteries and renewable energy, often to catch up with China\u2019s advances. According to Chalmers, the International Monetary Fund found 18,000 instances of subsidy intervention by China, the US and Europe between 2008 and 2021. It also identified a further 2,500 cases last year alone, with those three economic blocks accounting for about half. Those trends supported the Albanese government\u2019s so-called Future Made in Australia investments, including in critical minerals processing and solar photovoltaic panel production. The 14 May federal budget is likely to contain more funds for such projects. \u201cWe can\u2019t replicate or retrofit the approaches under way elsewhere,\u201d Chalmers will say. \u201cBut it would be preposterously self-defeating to leave our policies unchanged in the face of all this industry policy taking shape and taking hold around us.\u201d Australia had to become \u201cindispensable\u201d to the global decarbonisation efforts. That could only happen, though, \u201cif we align our economic and security interests more tightly, and only if we invest and engage, not just protect or retreat\u201d. More money will go to the Treasury\u2019s compliance team to \u201cbetter monitor and enforce\u201d conditions imposed on deals by the foreign investment review board. \u201cThis team will also support the use of my call-in power to review investments that come to pose a national security concern in time,\u201d he will say. The government will also release updated guidance about tax arrangements to ensure foreign companies pay their way. Foreign investors will be allowed to buy established build-to-rent properties to foster demand and provide incentives to construct new projects. Direct and portfolio foreign investment reached about $3.5tn in 2023. As for the pending Future Made in Australia legislation, the government plans to set five key tests for its intervention, ranging from whether the investment is in an industry that the country can be competitive to its contribution \u201cto an orderly path to net zero\u201d. Other tests include the boosting of skills and support to regional Australia, and whether it improves \u201cAustralia\u2019s national security and economic resilience\u201d. But the private sector will have to play a key role in such investments and \u201cdeliver genuine value for money for government\u201d."

            "date": "2024-04-08T17:57:09Z",
            "content": "It is a global company with more than two centuries of managing money but for Abrdn, jokes in the media about the lack of vowels in its name are no laughing matter. After changing its name three years ago, an executive at the fund manager formerly known as Standard Life Aberdeen has accused the media of \u201ccorporate bullying\u201d that would not be acceptable if the business was a person. Chief investment officer Peter Branner pointed a finger at the press, which he said continued to make \u201cchildish jokes\u201d about the name change. \u201cI understand that corporate bullying to some extent is part of the game with the press, even though it\u2019s a little childish to keep hammering the missing vowels in our name,\u201d he said in an interview with the trade magazine Financial News. \u201cWould you do that with an individual? How would you look at a person who makes fun of your name day-in day-out? It\u2019s probably not ethical to do it. But apparently with companies it is different,\u201d he added. Unlike individuals who rarely choose their own names, Abrdn paid an undisclosed sum to branding agency Wolff Olins before settling on its new identity in one of the most divisive corporate rebrands in recent memory. The company, formed by the \u00a33.8bn merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management in 2017, was pushed to rebrand after selling its UK and European life insurance business, as well as its Standard Life brand name, to Phoenix Group. The change prompted immediate criticism of the asset manager\u2019s \u201cill-thought-out\u201d decision to drop its vowels, which is a strategy more typically employed by TikTok stars and YouTubers such as the Strictly Come Dancing star Hrvy. Sources said the company rejected using \u201cAberdeen\u201d, because it would not have been able to control the intellectual property rights for the name of an existing city. Instead, it settled on Abrdn in the spring of 2021, prompting scorn from City analysts, linguists and the press, who joked the company was experiencing \u201cirritable vowel syndrome\u201d, and was trying to be \u201ctoo cool for schl\u201d, and that the decision was \u201crlly stpd\u201d. Chief executive Stephen Bird \u2013 who has been jokingly referred to as Stphn Brd \u2013 has since defended the change, and claimed clients had \u201cfully embraced it\u201d. An Abrdn spokesperson said: \u2018\u2018As Peter made clear in his interview, we appreciate it is for the media to make their own assessments about the companies they wish to write about.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-11T11:07:47Z",
            "content": "Profits at Somerset Capital Management, the investment firm co-founded by Jacob Rees-Mogg, more than halved in the year before managers announced the once-$10bn fund would be wound down. Accounts filed at Companies House on Thursday show Somerset Capital Management\u2019s profits in the year to 31 March 2023 dropped to \u00a34.2m from \u00a39.1m the previous year, and \u00a313.5m in 2021. The decline in profits meant there was less money to share out among the fund\u2019s members \u2013 including Rees-Mogg, the multimillionaire Conservative MP and Brexiter. The members shared \u00a33.1m, down from \u00a36.4m a year earlier, and \u00a39.7m the year before that. Rees-Mogg is understood to hold about 12% of the shares, which would value his share of last year\u2019s profits at about \u00a3350,000. Rees-Mogg \u2013 who when he was 12 and riding in a Rolls-Royce proudly declared his ambitions: \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be rich\u201d \u2013 is reported to have received at least \u00a37.5m in dividends from Somerset since the EU referendum in 2016. He also received about \u00a315,000 a month from the firm on top of his MP\u2019s pay until 2019, when he became a minister under Boris Johnson. Somerset announced in December 2023 that it was winding down after it lost two-thirds of its assets and its largest client. St James\u2019s Place, the UK\u2019s largest wealth manager, ended its relationship with the firm and shifted a \u00a32bn mandate to another fund manager. The shock move left Somerset with $1bn (\u00a3796m) in assets, down from a peak of $10bn in 2018. Rees-Mogg and his fellow shareholders had been in line for a huge windfall from their investment several times as Somerset flirted with a succession of deals. The firm was valued at between \u00a370m and \u00a3100m in 2018 when it entered inconclusive merger talks with an unnamed US firm. It rejected a bid of up to \u00a390m from London\u2019s Artemis Investment Management the following year. The MP has remained a passive minority shareholder since stepping back from advising on investment strategy and the daily running of the business. Somerset\u2019s accounts said 2023 profits were lower because revenue dropped 29.5% to \u00a316.6m, with lower management fees as a result of \u201ca fall in the assets under management during the period\u201d. The accounts warned that members \u201cexpect the profitability of the [firm] to decrease\u201d further as a result of more \u201cclient flows\u201d of money out of the partnership. The accounts also said \u201cthe strengthening of the British pound would have a negative impact on profitability\u201d as a significant proportion of its revenues were in overseas currencies. The company did not respond to requests for further comment on the fund\u2019s performance, or Rees-Mogg\u2019s share of the profits. Rees-Mogg\u2019s net worth was estimated at \u201cwell over \u00a3100m\u201d, by Spear\u2019s wealth management magazine in 2019. That figure also accounted for the expected inheritance of his wife, Lady Helena de Chair, whose mother was said to have a \u00a345m fortune. His assets include a \u00a35m house behind Westminster Abbey and the freehold of a building in Pall Mall, reported to be worth \u00a34m. When in Somerset he and his family live at Gournay Court, a 17th-century house that was restored and enlarged by King George V. A household presence is his former nanny, Veronica Crook, now nanny to his children. A vintage cars enthusiast, Rees-Mogg also owns a 1968 T-Series Bentley, a 1936 3.5litre Bentley and a Lexus for driving around town."

            "date": "2024-04-22T20:16:00Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden marked Monday\u2019s Earth Day by announcing a $7bn investment in solar energy projects nationwide, focusing on disadvantaged communities, and unveiling a week-long series of what the White House say will be \u201chistoric climate actions\u201d. The president was speaking at Prince William Forest Park, in Triangle, Virginia, touting his environmental record and unveiling measures to tackle the climate crisis and increase access to, and lower costs of, clean energy. The centerpiece was the announcement of $7bn in grants through the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s \u201csolar for all\u201d program, funded by last year\u2019s $369bn Inflation Reduction Act, and which Biden said will benefit hundreds of thousands of mostly low-income families who currently spend up to 30% of their income on energy. \u201cThese awards across the country [are to] states, territories, tribal governments, municipalities and non-profits to develop programs to enable low income and disadvantaged communities to benefit from residential solar power. And it\u2019s a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cSolar for all program means 900,000 households will have solar on the rooftops for the first time and soon, millions of families will save over $400 a year on utility bills.\u201d The EPA has calculated that the investment, will be distributed through grants to 60 applicant organizations nationwide, will generate $8bn in household electricity bill savings over the life of the program. Projects funded by the solar for all program will create 200,000 jobs, Biden said, and advance his Justice40 initiative, in which at least 40% of the benefits of investments in federal climate clean energy, and affordable and sustainable housing projects, are directed to communities \u201cmarginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution\u201d. Biden also announced a new website to encourage citizens to join the American Climate Corps, a volunteer government organization modeled on former president Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s much-vaunted Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s. The site, climatecorps.gov, aims to initially fill about 2,000 positions across 36 states, Washington DC and Puerto Rico, hosted by organizations working on clean energy, conservation and climate resilience projects. Ultimately the corps will employ more than 20,000 young people, the White House says. Aimed mainly at young people, the administration said in a press release that the scheme\u2019s objective was \u201cto make it easy for any American to find work tackling the climate crisis while gaining the skills necessary for the clean energy and climate resilience workforce of the future\u201d. \u201cToday is a historic day and a landmark achievement,\u201d said the Democratic New York representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who spoke shortly before Biden took the stage. \u201c[It] serves as a reminder of the power of organizing, of what we can accomplish when young people, climate advocates, labor organizers and working people come together to demand the future we all deserve.\u201d Biden was also joined by the independent Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, one of the architects of the inflation act, who said the climate crisis was an \u201cexistential threat\u201d. \u201cClimate change is real, climate change through drought, floods, forest fires, heatwaves and extreme weather disturbances is already causing massive devastation for our country and the entire world,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIf anyone tells you climate change is a hoax, have them talk to farmers whose crop production is dwindling, have them talk to firefighters who risk their lives fighting fires with more severity and size than we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Today\u2019s announcements follow climate measures advanced by Biden officials last week, which included restricting oil and gas leases on 13m acres in Alaska, and finalizing a federal land management rule that makes conservation an equal priority to \u201charmful\u201d private industry activities such as oil drilling at government-owned assets. Biden has been trying to shore up his support among younger, climate-savvy voters who have been disappointed with the administration\u2019s approval last year of oil and gas developments including the huge Willow project in Alaska. Advocates have also been putting pressure on Biden to declare a climate emergency. He said Republicans posed a threat to climate reforms he had initiated, such as rejoining the Paris agreement that Donald Trump withdrew from. \u201cDespite the overwhelming devastation in red and blue states, there are still those who deny climate is in crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cMy Maga Republican friends don\u2019t seem to think it\u2019s in crisis, they want to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act that provides the funding for a vast majority of these projects, and roll back protections for clean air and clean water. \u201cAnyone in or out of government who willfully denies the impacts of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future, and the world, I might add.\u201d Biden\u2019s Virginia trip was the first of a packed Earth Week itinerary of visits nationwide by administration officials, including the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, and the energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, that officials insist will \u201cbuild a stronger, healthier future for all\u201d. According to the White House, Tuesday\u2019s theme will be clean water for all communities; Wednesday will focus on accelerating the US\u2019s clean transportation future; Thursday will focus on steps to cut pollution from the power sector and strengthen the US electricity grid; and Friday will see measures to promote cleaner air and healthier schools. Climate activist groups welcomed Biden\u2019s solar energy announcement. \u201cSolar for all is exactly the type of investment the country needs to reimagine our clean energy future,\u201d Jean Su, energy justice program director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. \u201cBroad community-based solar is our brightest hope for protecting people and our climate from the scourge of fossil fuels. These targeted investments mean low-income families get clean energy that is affordable, resilient and protects our ecosystems. It\u2019s great to see President Biden jumpstart this landmark program.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-10T22:03:23Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden and Fumio Kishida, the Japanese prime minister, have announced a new era of military cooperation during the pomp and pageantry of a White House state visit aimed at countering China. The US president said the two nations\u2019 forces will cooperate on a joint command structure and, along with Australia, develop a new air missile defence network. \u201cWe\u2019re increasing the interoperability and planning of our militaries so they can work together in a seamless and effective way,\u201d Biden said at a joint press conference with Kishida in the bright sunshine of the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday. \u201cThis is the most significant upgrade in our alliance since it was first established. \u201cI\u2019m also pleased to announce that for the first time, Japan and the United States and Australia will create a networked system of air, missile and defence architecture. We\u2019re also looking forward to standing up a trilateral military exercise with Japan and the United Kingdom.\u201d The president, born a year after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that prompted US entry into the second world war, said the agreements set a \u201cnew benchmark for our military cooperation\u201d. The move appears aimed at making US and Japanese forces more nimble in the event of a crisis such as a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Biden insisted that it was \u201cpurely defensive\u201d and \u201cnot aimed at any one nation or a threat to the region\u201d. Kishida told reporters that the two leaders had discussed tense relations between Taiwan and China and pledged to uphold international order based on the rule of law. \u201cWe confirmed that unilateral attempts to change status quo by force or coercion is absolutely unacceptable,\u201d Kishida said. The US and Japan will continue to respond to such actions, including challenges from China, he added. \u201cRegarding Russia\u2019s aggression of Ukraine, based on a recognition that Ukraine today may be east Asia tomorrow.\u201d The leaders also announced deals for technology, including artificial intelligence and the economy, along with a joint partnership to accelerate development and commercialisation of nuclear fusion. Biden said they had a shared goal that a Japanese person will be the first non-American to walk on the moon, flying on a US mission due to take place in a few years\u2019 time. Japan is taking on a more prominent global role after a series of security law changes in the past decade that have transformed its pacifist constitution. Biden also noted that Japan is the top foreign investor in the US. Overall the US and Japan have struck about 70 agreements on defence cooperation, including moves to upgrade the US military command structure in Japan, the biggest such change since the 1960s. The two sides will set up a forum for the co-development and co-production of missiles and maintenance of US warships and aircraft, as well as a working group for fighter pilot training and co-development and co-production of jet trainers. A joint statement said the US\u2019s Aukus defence partnership with Australia and Britain is considering cooperation with Japan on advanced capabilities and technologies including quantum computing, undersea, hypersonic, artificial intelligence and cyber technology. Asked if there was a path for Japan to become a full member of Aukus, Kishida replied: \u201cWe want to contribute to the peace and stability of the region and therefore we have consistently supported Aukus \u2026 But for Japan, to have a direct cooperation with Aukus, nothing has been decided at this moment.\u201d Kishida is the first Japanese leader to get a US state visit since Shinzo Abe in 2015 and only the fifth world leader to receive one since Biden took office in 2021. The dinner was held in the grand East Room of the White House, decorated by fans and cherry blossom branches. White House chefs served a meal featuring Japanese flavors, starting with house-cured salmon, followed by dry-aged ribeye with wasabi sauce, and salted caramel pistachio cake with cherry ice-cream. After dinner, singer Paul Simon performed hits while playing guitar, including Graceland and Slip Slidin\u2019 Away. Simon is one of Jill Biden\u2019s favourite artists, according to the White House. At the dinner, Kishida quoted from the science fiction series Star Trek, telling guests \u201cI would like to propose a toast to our voyage to the frontier of the Japan-US relationship with this word: boldly go,\u201d a phrase from the iconic opening monologue of the TV series. Other notable guests at the dinner included Bill and Hillary Clinton and actor Robert De Niro. Kishida will address Congress on Thursday and join Biden and the Philippines president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, for a meeting expected to focus on Beijing\u2019s South China Sea incursions. Biden also expressed support for Japan\u2019s attempts to set up a leader-to-leader summit with North Korea. \u201cWe welcome the opportunity of our allies to initiate dialogue with the Democratic Republic of Korea,\u201d he commented. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said many times, we\u2019re open to dialogue ourselves at any time but without preconditions from the DPRK.\u201d"

            "title": "India seeks UK carbon tax exemption in free trade deal talks",
            "date": "2024-04-19T06:28:28Z",
            "content": "India is demanding an exemption from the UK\u2019s planned carbon tax as part of negotiations aiming to finalise a free trade deal before the UK election. India\u2019s negotiating team have spent this week in London in a surprise set of talks to try to overcome the remaining hurdles to an agreement. Rishi Sunak is eager to get the trade deal over the line and had hoped to clinch it last month. India has used the limited time Sunak has left before a general election as a bargaining chip. A UK government official said Indian negotiators were \u201csaying they have five years to plan ahead, this government has five months\u201d. The talks are taking place as India\u2019s six-week general election campaign, starting on Friday, is about to get under way. Opinion polls in India suggest Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party will win for the third time running. UK polling, meanwhile, suggests Sunak\u2019s Conservative party is on course for a defeat. India\u2019s commerce minister said on Monday that there were \u201cvery few pending issues\u201d and that a deal was close to being finalised. The UK government official, who has been briefed on progress in the talks, said India was asking to be exempted from the UK\u2019s planned carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) on the basis that it is a developing country. India had raised concerns about the application of a CBAM \u2013 a planned tax on the import of carbon-intensive goods such as steel, glass and fertiliser \u2013 at an earlier stage in the talks. The tax would affect Indian steelmakers looking to export to the UK. Any decision to exempt India from a carbon tax would be controversial. The plans are designed to reduce emissions and support UK steel producers by levelling the playing field with countries that have a lower or no carbon levy. The discussions this week continue the 14th formal round of negotiations between the UK and India. The round was declared closed last month before India\u2019s election campaign, but a second UK government official said it was kept open at India\u2019s request. The discussions this week, which involve India\u2019s chief trade negotiator, have been kept under wraps in the UK but made it into the Indian press. India has also been asking for more concessions on visas for Indian workers and a social security agreement, both longstanding issues in the negotiations. The talks in London are due to conclude on Friday but may continue remotely next week. Before the talks on Monday, India\u2019s commerce secretary, Sunil Barthwal, told the media: \u201cA team is going to the UK this week. There are very few pending issues left in the negotiation. A couple of key priority issues to seal the deal are being ironed out to have a balanced outcome.\u201d India is a notoriously tough negotiator on trade. Last month its government signed a \u00a379bn trade deal with the European Free Trade Association, a bloc made up of Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein, 16 years after talks began. The UK and India launched trade negotiations in January 2022 while Boris Johnson was prime minister. Johnson said he wanted the deal to be \u201cdone by Diwali\u201d in October 2022, but that deadline has been overshot by 18 months. A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK and India continue to work towards an ambitious trade deal that works for both countries. While we don\u2019t comment on the details of live negotiations, there are no plans to change our immigration policy to achieve this free trade agreement. The business and trade secretary has always been clear she will only sign a deal that is fair, balanced and ultimately in the best interests of the British people and the economy.\u201d"

            "title": "Aggressive use of state subsidies risks expensive trade wars, IMF warns",
            "date": "2024-04-10T13:30:10Z",
            "content": "Aggressive use of industrial policy by the world\u2019s most powerful economies risks becoming an expensive mistake that could trigger a tit-for-tat subsidy war, the International Monetary Fund has said. In a warning shot to governments around the world, the IMF said attempts to increase innovation only worked under certain limited conditions and were not a \u201cmagic cure\u201d for slow growth. Era Dabla-Norris, the deputy director of the IMF\u2019s fiscal affairs department, said: \u201cHistory shows that getting industrial policy right can be a tall order, and there are many cautionary tales of policy mistakes, high fiscal costs and negative spillovers to other countries.\u201d It comes as leading western governments adopt an increasingly interventionist approach to boosting economic growth, gradually turning away from a reliance on the private sector, low taxes and the light-touch regulation built up over the past four decades. In a sign of increasing tensions over industrial policy, Beijing has accused the EU of protectionism after Brussels launched a subsidy investigation into Chinese wind turbine companies. \u201cChina is highly concerned about the discriminatory measures taken by the European Union against Chinese companies and even industries,\u201d the country\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. The EU\u2019s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, announced an investigation on Tuesday into whether Chinese companies involved in wind farms across Europe may have benefited from support from Beijing. While careful to avoid singling out any country for criticism, the IMF used a chapter from its half-yearly fiscal monitor to express scepticism about the benefits claimed for industrial strategies and urged rich countries to concentrate on support for underfunded basic research. It said recent initiatives \u2013 such as the Chips Act and Inflation Reduction Act in the US, the Green Deal Industrial Plan in the EU, the New Direction on Economy and Industrial Policy in Japan, and the K-Chips Act in Korea \u2013 as well as longstanding policies in large emerging market economies such as China were alike in having a strong emphasis on innovation in specific sectors. Most packages involve governments offering tax and subsidy incentives for investment in green and advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence and semiconductors. Dabla-Norris said the resurgence in industrial policy was motivated by concerns about economic and energy security, and the hope that it would re-ignite productivity growth, which has been weak in many parts of the world since the global financial crisis of 2008. Using industrial policy to promote innovation was only worth it if the benefits could be well identified and measured, and the subsidies were provided to sectors that generated higher knowledge spillovers to other sectors, Dabla-Norris said. Gains could be particularly high in the case of innovation that accelerated the development of green technologies to lower carbon emissions. However, she feared activist government policies could lead to \u201cmisallocation of resources and capture by special interests\u201d, because most approaches relied heavily on costly subsidies. \u201cPotential gains could quickly run into sizeable losses,\u201d she said. \u201cFurther, we show that discriminating against foreign firms can actually prove self-defeating, as such policies can trigger costly retaliation in most countries. Even major advanced economies rely on innovation that is done elsewhere.\u201d The IMF said in technologically advanced economies, a more cost-effective way to increase innovation and growth was a mix of public funding for fundamental research, research and development grants for innovative startups, and tax incentives to encourage applied innovation across firms. \u201cWe estimate that increasing spending on these policies by 0.5 percentage points of gross domestic product \u2013 or about 50% of the current level in OECD economies \u2013 could raise GDP by up to 2% for the average advanced economy. That level of spending on innovation could even reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio over the long term.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-08T15:53:09Z",
            "content": "Russia and Ukraine have each accused the other of launching kamikaze drones at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in an incident condemned by the International Atomic Energy Agency for recklessly endangering safety. The nuclear watchdog said onsite inspectors had seen the damage caused by drone detonations at three locations, including \u201csuperficial scorching\u201d at the top of the roof of reactor 6, although it said its structural integrity was not compromised. It is the first time the nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, has been targeted in military action since November 2022. Captured by Russia early in the war, the plant sits directly on the frontline, within range of both sides\u2019 militaries. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the IAEA, described the episode as a major escalation and called for it not be repeated. \u201cSuch reckless attacks significantly increase the risk of a major nuclear accident and must cease immediately,\u201d he said. Responsibility was contested by the two sides in the conflict, and the IAEA did not say who it believed was responsible. Instead it described the damage, saying that at one point, while inspectors were on the roof of reactor 6, they saw Russian troops firing at what appeared to be an oncoming drone, which exploded \u201cnear the reactor building\u201d. Inspectors said they also saw \u201cremnants of drones\u201d on the roof of reactor 6 and two other locations. At a second location, a laboratory, they also observed \u201cblood stains next to a damaged military logistics vehicle\u201d, indicating at least one casualty. Russia blamed the drone incident on Ukraine. \u201cAttempts by the Ukrainian armed forces to attack the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant continue,\u201d the Russians controlling the facility said. \u201cA kamikaze drone was shot down over the plant. It fell on the roof of unit 6.\u201d Earlier, Ukraine said Moscow was spreading \u201cfake\u201d information that Kyiv had fired drones at the plant. Lt Andriy Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine\u2019s centre for countering disinformation, said Russia was attacking the facility \u201cwith drones, pretending that the threat to the plant and nuclear safety is incoming from Ukraine\u201d. The nuclear plant was captured in the early stages of the two-year-long war, and despite occasional efforts to reconnect to the Russian energy grid its reactors have gradually been put into shutdown. Five out of six are in cold shutdown, where the reactors are running at a temperature below boiling point. A sixth, reactor number four, is running in hot shutdown, primarily to produce heating for the nearby town of Enerhodar. Earlier this month, with the winter heating season concluded, the IAEA said engineers at the site were considering downgrading reactor 4 to the colder state. Greenpeace raised concerns in March that Russia was considering restarting the reactors so they could generate electricity, an unprecedented scenario in an active war zone."

            "date": "2024-04-22T19:27:33Z",
            "content": "The New York Jets are reportedly trading former first-round pick Zach Wilson to the Denver Broncos, ending a career with the team that ranged from satisfactory to disastrous. Wilson will compete with Jarrett Stidham and Ben DiNucci to begin next season as the Broncos\u2019 starter, although Denver may select a quarterback in this week\u2019s draft. ESPN reports that the Broncos sent a sixth-round pick to the Jets in return for Wilson and a seventh-round pick. New York and Denver will split Wilson\u2019s $5.5m salary in 2024 equally, according to ESPN. Denver had been rumored to be targeting a trade up for quarterback in the upcoming draft. Coach Sean Payton called it a \u201crealistic\u201d option in March, though the team has less capital to make a leap up in the first round compared to other quarterback needy teams. \u201cLook, I mean, do we have to draft a quarterback?'\u2019 Payton said last week. \u201cYou\u2019d say man, it sure looks like we have to draft a quarterback and yet, it\u2019s got to be the right fit, the right one. And if you had the tip sheets as to who everyone else was taking, it would be easier to answer that question ... That\u2019s the puzzle here.\u2019 The Jets picked Wilson with the No 2 overall pick in the 2021 draft as the team hoped to avoid selecting yet another bust at quarterback. But there were some who believed Wilson\u2019s gaudy college numbers at BYU were disproportionately boosted by a strong supporting cast and a weak schedule of opponents. Those doubts appeared to be proved true as Wilson struggled badly in his first season, although he occasionally flashed glimpses of his talent and was not helped by a weak team surrounding him. The Jets started the 2022 season strongly, but Wilson had little to do with their success, was unpopular with some of his teammates and was benched towards the end of the campaign. When the team traded for Aaron Rodgers before the start of last season, Wilson appeared to be set for a spell as a back-up, where he could possibly learn from one of the game\u2019s all-time greats. But Rodgers suffered a season-ending injury in his Jets debut and Wilson was called back into action as the Jets starter. 2023 was statistically the best of Wilson\u2019s Jets career \u2013 and the only one in which he threw more touchdowns than interceptions \u2013 but he still failed to play like a first-round quarterback and, with Rodgers returning from injury, the Jets have decided to move on. In 33 starts over three season, the 24-year-old threw for 6,239 yards, 23 touchdowns and 25 interceptions. His QBR of 30.6 in 2023 was the worst among qualified starters in the NFL. With Wilson traded to Denver, only one quarterback of the five selected in the first round of the 2021 draft \u2013 Trevor Lawrence \u2013 remains with the team they were originally drafted by."

            "content": "The former England and Liverpool footballer John Barnes has been banned as a director after his company failed to pay tens of thousands of pounds in tax, following an investigation by the HM Revenue\u2019s Insolvency Service. The investigation revealed that between 2018 and 2020, John Barnes Media \u2013 which offered media representation services \u2013 failed to pay more than \u00a3190,000 in corporation tax and VAT. His ban, which started on Wednesday, prevents him from being involved in the promotion, formation or management of a company, without the permission of the court. Barnes, whose business was listed as having a Surrey address, has signed a disqualification undertaking that bans him from being a company director for the next three and a half years. Mike Smith, the chief investigator at the Insolvency Service, said: \u201cJohn Barnes had a legal duty to ensure his company paid the correct amount of corporation tax and VAT. Instead, it paid no tax whatsoever between November 2018 and October 2020, despite receiving earnings of well over \u00a3400,000. If you do not pay your taxes while directing money elsewhere, you are at risk of being banned.\u201d Barnes, who earned 79 England caps during a professional playing career spanning almost two decades, formed John Barnes Media in September 2012. He was the sole director, and the company described itself as offering media representation services. Between November 2018 and October 2020, John Barnes Media\u2019s turnover was \u00a3441,798. Nothing was paid to HM Revenue and Customs in tax during that period, despite the company filing returns showing what the VAT payments should have been. The Insolvency Service\u2019s investigation showed that John Barnes Media failed to pay \u00a378,839 in corporation tax between August 2018 and January 2020, when the company ceased trading. The company also failed to pay \u00a3115,272 in VAT between February 2019 and 2020. Insolvency Service investigations into Barnes\u2019 conduct as a director began in September 2023."

            "date": "2024-04-17T21:51:39Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden announced plans to triple tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum and promised to block the acquisition of US Steel by a Japanese company during a speech to steelworkers on Wednesday in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, where union support could prove crucial in the November general election. Biden touted the plan during a visit to the United Steelworkers union headquarters in Pittsburgh, the heart of the American steel industry, where he said \u201cthe backbone of America has a steel spine\u201d and promised to keep US Steel as a \u201ctotally American-owned, American-operated\u201d company. The Biden administration is reviewing a proposed $14.9bn acquisition of US Steel, once the world\u2019s largest company and which played a key role in the nation\u2019s industrialization, by Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel. Biden said last month he would oppose the deal. As he was greeted by a small group of steelworkers upon his arrival in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, one shouted: \u201cKeep US Steel in America!\u201d Biden responded: \u201cGuaranteed.\u201d A large group of protesters gathered across the street, one group chanting \u201cBidenomics has got to go\u201d and another yelling \u201cCeasefire now!\u201d During his speech, the president called on his trade representative to consider tripling the existing 7.5% tariff rate on Chinese steel and aluminum imports, a move the White House said was aimed at protecting American jobs against \u201cunfair\u201d competition. \u201cFor too long, the Chinese government has poured state money into Chinese steel companies that produce more steel than China needs, and end up dumping extra steel on the global markets with unfairly low prices,\u201d Biden said on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s not competing, that\u2019s cheating, and we\u2019ve seen the damage here in America.\u201d The US will work with Mexico to ensure that Chinese firms cannot avoid American steel tariffs by shipping via Mexican ports, Biden said. He also announced a new investigation by his trade representative into Chinese subsidies for its shipbuilding industry. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for a fight with China,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for competition, but fair competition.\u201d The administration has accused China of distorting markets and hurting the US economy by flooding the market with artificially low-priced steel. \u201cThe president understands we must invest in American manufacturing. But we also have to protect those investments and those workers from unfair exports associated with China\u2019s industrial overcapacity,\u201d Lael Brainard, the White House national economic adviser, told reporters. Biden is on a three-day campaign-trail swing through Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state that he narrowly won in 2020. He visited with union workers in his childhood hometown of Scranton on Tuesday and will visit Philadelphia on Thursday. The trip is part of a broader effort to draw contrasts with his opponent, former president Donald Trump, who first put into place broad tariffs on Chinese goods and who has repeatedly floated the idea of imposing a 10% tariff on all US imports as well as a tariff of up to 60% on Chinese imports if he is elected in November. Trump\u2019s proposals would \u201cbadly hurt\u201d American consumers and cost the average American family an average of $1,500 a year, Biden warned. In response, the Trump campaign said Biden had spent his entire career \u201cbetraying\u201d working Americans by supporting Chinese membership in the World Trade Organization in 2011. The former president is spending much of the week in a Manhattan courtroom in his criminal trial."

            "date": "2024-04-24T16:18:17Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak has claimed that his plan to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030 won\u2019t stop the government from cutting taxes and investing in public services. (See 1.38pm.) Angela Rayner has accused ministers of \u201cobsessing\u201d over her living arrangements and urged them to focus on implementing long-promised housing reforms instead. Tributes from across the political spectrum have been paid to the former Labour minister and welfare campaigner Frank Field, who has died at the age of 81. And here is the Guardian\u2019s obituary of Field, by Dennis Kavanagh. Ministers have pledged to publish a long-buried internal study into the emotional and financial impact of fines and prosecutions incurred by tens of thousands of unpaid carers for falling foul of strict carer\u2019s allowance earnings rules. Jeffrey Donaldson has appeared in court charged with rape, gross indecency and other sexual offences spanning 21 years in a case that has stunned Northern Ireland. Ministers are unable to say when the ban on no-fault eviction set out in the renters (reform) bill will actually come into force (see 3.16pm) because the government has tabled an amendment (new clause 30, or NC30) saying the Ministry of Justice must carry out a review of county court capacity first. This is one of the changes being made as a concession to landlords. The justification for it is that, if landlords cannot use no-fault evictions, they may end up spending a lot more time in court trying to persuade judges to allow them to remove their tenants. This is one of more than 200 government amendments down for debate today. Most of them are very minor and technical, but they are needed because the government is making substantial changes to the bill too (like NC30). The bill has already gone through its committee stage in the Commons and it is unusual for so much re-writing to be taking place at this point. In the debate this afternoon, defending NC30, Jacob Young, the housing minister, said: If we don\u2019t have a ready court system when we make this change, the biggest change in 30 years, if the courts aren\u2019t ready for these changes that will not benefit tenants, it won\u2019t benefit landlords, but it certainly won\u2019t benefit tenants either \u2026 New clause 30 will enable the government to assess the effects that our new tenancy system is having on the county courts before our reforms are rolled out more widely, giving us confidence that the sector is ready. The Conservative MP Natalie Elphicke has accused her own party of breaking a promise it made in its last election manifesto to ban no-fault evictions. During this afternoon\u2019s debate on the renters (reform) bill Elphicke echoed an argument made by Angela Rayner at PMQs (see 3.16pm), telling MPs: This is a bill that the Conservative manifesto in 2019 promised would benefit tenants. Instead, this has become a bill where the balance too often is in favour of the landlords, particularly with the new clause 30 which could indefinitely delay the abolition of section 21 no-fault evictions. If that were so, that would be nothing short of a betrayal for the Conservative manifesto that was promised in 2019 and, for that reason, I\u2019m unable to support this today. Referring to other features of the bill, which is being watered down by government amendments favourable to landlords, she said: It is my view that this bill does not go far enough now in dealing with the fundamental challenges of the private rented sector. The private rented sector is no longer a flex or transitionary tenure. It is the main tenure for millions of people for much, if not all, of their lives. Sadly, the original principle of the bill, which was to create a fair and responsible new rented sector, has been undermined by the government\u2019s amendments. Here are some of the pictures from today\u2019s PMQs taken by Jessica Taylor, the official Commons photographer. Ben Habib, a deputy leader of Reform UK, has proposed not rescuing people in the Channel if they scupper their small boats and refuse new dinghies as they should \u201csuffer the consequences of their actions\u201d. Rowena Mason has the story. A reader asks: Is there any truth is the rumour that this \u201cadditional\u201d defence spending will include the money spent/given to Ukraine and others abroad? Yes, it will. I covered this on the blog yesterday, but here is the page from a Ministry of Defence document sent to journalists confirming that military aid to Ukraine is included in the sum linked to the 2.5% target. According to polling by YouGov, while public concern about how the government was handling inflation went up at roughly the same rate as inflation itself, it is not going down at the same rate. A reader has asked for a fuller version of the exchange at PMQs between Mhairi Black, the SNP\u2019s deputy leader at Westminster, and Oliver Dowden, the deputy PM, about mass graves in Gaza. (See 12.23pm.) Black started: Two years ago, when mass graves were discovered in Ukraine, this House united in condemnation and rightly treated those graves as evidence of war crimes, which Russia must be made to answer for. Yesterday, Palestinian officials uncovered two mass graves outside the bombed hospitals in Gaza. Those graves also constitute a war crime, do they not? Dowden replied: Of course, we would expect the democratic Government of Israel to investigate any allegations of misconduct. That is exactly what they are doing, and it is exactly what the foreign secretary and the prime minister urge them to do. However, I find it quite extraordinary that the hon. Lady seeks to draw parallels between the legitimate war of self-defence of Israel and the conduct of Russia. Then Black responded: Three hundred bodies, including of the elderly and the injured, some of which had been stripped naked and mutilated, with their hands tied behind their backs. The UK\u2019s own arms policy states that if there is even a risk that war crimes may be taking place, that is reason enough to halt the sale of arms. Given all that we know, why is the prime minister yet to do so? And Dowden replied: We continue to urge the Israeli government to investigate any allegations of misconduct. The difference though is that we can trust the Israeli Government \u2013 a democratically elected Government \u2013 to properly investigate those things. Of course, we keep the advice under review. The foreign secretary has recently made it clear that he has conducted a determination and has not changed his advice regarding export licences, and I think that is the correct decision. MPs are now debating the final stages of the renters (reform) bill. It is supposed to implement a commitment in the Conservative party\u2019s 2019 manifesto to abolish no-fault evictions but amendments tabled by the government have watered this down. At PMQs Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, challenged Oliver Dowden, the deputy PM, to say when the ban on no-fault evictions would come into force. In an interview with the BBC this morning Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, said he hoped the bill would become law before the election, and at PMQs Rayner asked Dowden: This week the housing minister said there is no solid date for banning no-fault evictions, the housing secretary [Gove] now says it won\u2019t happen before an election, so if he can give us a date, can he name it now? Dowden replied: I can name the date for [Rayner], today. It\u2019s today that this house will be voting on it. And I\u2019m confident that in line with our manifesto we will deliver on that commitment. In response, the Renters\u2019 Reform Coalition said Dowden was being \u201cdisingenuous\u201d. Tom Darling, campaign manager at the coalition, said: Michael Gove U-turned this morning to say he couldn\u2019t guarantee the end of no-fault evictions. The deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden knows that no-fault evictions won\u2019t be abolished today, so it\u2019s disingenuous for him to say the practice will end today. Renters facing these evictions up and down the country tomorrow, who have already been so badly let down by endless delays caused by Conservative landlord MPs, don\u2019t deserve to have their hopes artificially raised yet again. Downing Street has now come up with an explanation for the discrepancy between the \u00a31bn the government said it would save from civil service job cuts last autumn and the \u00a32.9bn it now says those cuts will save. (See 2.15pm.) No 10 says the \u00a31bn figure was the amount that would be saved from capping headcount numbers at current levels. By March 2025 that would save \u00a31bn, the Treasury said at the time. But the figure quoted yesterday relates to how much would be saved by starting to reduce the civil service headcount from 2025-26 onwards. Those savings would get you to \u00a32.9bn by 2028-28, No 10 says. At the post-PMQs lobby briefing Downing Street was unable to explain why the government now expects to save far more from its plans to cut the size of the civil service than the amount it said it would raise when this proposal was first announced. Explaining how it will fund the plan to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030, the government has said \u00a31.6bn will come from an increase in R&amp;D funding for defence and the remaining \u00a32.9bn will come from a reduction in civil service headcount to pre-pandemic level \u2013 a reduction of 70,000 people. But in October 2023, when Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, announced the plan to reduce civil service numbers at the Conservative party conferenve, he said this would save \u00a31bn by 2025. A No 10 spokesperson said there were no further details about how those reductions would lead to a saving of almost \u00a32bn more. She said: There has been work under way with the Treasury and departments after announcing that we would cap headcount and we have now come forward with the costings associated with that and confirmed that would be reallocated to defence spending. We will set it out in spending reviews in the usual way, there will be a programme of work. There is no spending review expected this year and one would not be expected to take place until after the election. UPDATE: After the lobby briefing No 10 did come back to journalists with an explanation for the discrepancy between the \u00a31bn figure and the \u00a32.9bn figure. See 2.39pm. Labour has described the government\u2019s claim that it has a plan to raise defence spending by \u00a375bn by 2030 as based on a \u201cfake figure\u201d. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has described this figure as misleading. (See 10.35am.) Speaking in the Commons, in response to a statement from Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, his Labour shadow John Healey said: If this 2030 plan had been in a budget, it would have been independently checked, openly costed, and fully funded. So where is the additional money coming from? How much from which other R&amp;D (research and development) budgets? How much from cutting how many civil servants in which departments? They\u2019ve tried this trick before, in the 2015 defence review ministers pledged to cut 30% of the MoD civil servants to make their defence spending plans add up. Civil servant numbers didn\u2019t go down, they went up. Not down to 41,000 but up to 63,000. Now he\u2019s mentioned an additional \u00a375bn five times in his statement, over the next six years the government\u2019s official spending plan are based on a 0.5% real annual growth in chore defence spending. Why has he invented his own zero growth baseline to produce this fake figure claiming an extra \u00a375bn for defence. The public will judge ministers by what they do, not what they say. In response, Shapps said: He says judge us by our action, not our words. You know what, we will, because 11 members of that side\u2019s frontbench voted against Trident. So it\u2019s no good for him and the leader of the opposition to go up to Barrow and claim that they\u2019re all in favour now of the nuclear weapons, of the nuclear defence. Some 402 people were detected crossing the Channel on Tuesday, according to provisional figures from the Home Office, PA Media reports. PA says: The cumulative number of arrivals by small boats in 2024 now stands at a provisional total of 6,667. This is 20% higher than the total at the equivalent point last year, which was 5,546, but slightly lower (down 0.4%) than the total at this stage in 2022, which was 6,691. Some seven boats were detected on Tuesday, which suggests an average of around 57 people per boat. There were 29,437 arrivals across the whole of 2023, down 36% on a record 45,774 arrivals in 2022. This is what Rishi Sunak said in response to the second question about the funding of the plan to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by the end of the decade. (See 1.04pm.) We have made a choice and I am not shying away from that choice. All governing is about prioritising. I have decided to prioritise defence because I think that is the right thing to do for our country. I am not going to get into writing the next manifesto here and now, but what I am confident about is that, if you have a strong plan for the economy, as we have, and that plan is working, we stick to that plan, we will be able to continue increasing defence spending. It is a completely funded plan. We have got a very clear idea of how to reduce civil service headcount, which has grown considerably over the last few years, and we can bring that back and use that to fund what I announced yesterday, and alongside that, continue to invest in public services and cut people\u2019s taxes. Q: How worried are you about Chinese spies? Scholz says espionage will not be tolerated. From recent court cases, you can see that Germany has been quite successful at catching spies, he says. He says allegations against the AfD candidates very worrying. He will not comment on the legal process. But what has been uncovered is a matter of concern, he says. That is a reference to this story. The press conference has now finished. Q: Why won\u2019t you deliver cruise missiles to Ukraine? Scholz says Germany has sent missiles to Ukraine. But he is clear about his decision not to send cruise missiles. Q: What is going to have to go to allow you to prioritise defence spending? Are more tax cuts off the table? And can you rule out further cuts to public services? Sunak says the government has record investment in the public services, including the NHS. That is not going to change, he says. The state pension is going up, he says. But he says he has made a choice. He says he will not write the next manifesto now. But he has a funded plan to increase defence spending. And, alongside that, he can \u201ccontinue to invest in public services and cut people\u2019s taxes\u201d, he says. This firms up what Sunak was saying earlier. See 12.53pm. Sunak seems to be sending out a clear message to people in his party that, just because he has committed to more money for defence, that does not mean that he won\u2019t be able to include tax cuts in the Conservative manifesto. Yesterday Ben Wallace, the former defence secretary, told the PM programme that Sunak had told him that he was able to go ahead with the defence announcements because \u201cother commitments\u201d that might have been in the manifesto were being dropped. Wallace did not know what those were, but he speculated it might have been a tax cut. Sunak praises Germany\u2019s record on support for Ukraine. But he says every country can bring something different to the table. On Nato defence spending generally, he says it is clear the world is becoming more dangerous. The UK recognises that it has to do more. Germany has raised its defence spending. The UK is putting its defence spend up to 2.5%. Other European countries are doing the same. This is an \u201cinflection point\u201d, he says. Q: [To Scholz] Are you convinced that Donald Trump is committed to Nato? Rishi Sunak says US administrations have often said Nato countries should increase defence spending. That is now happening. Scholz does not refer to Trump, but he defends Germany\u2019s record on defence spending, which is rising. At the press conference the opening statements are over, and Rishi Sunak and Olaf Scholz are now taking questions. Q: [To Sunak] Are you really being honest with people about the funding of your defence spending plan? Sunak does not accept he is misleading people. He says the government will reduce the size of the civil service. The government is making a choice, he says. He thinks it is important for Britain to stand up for its values. He says this announcement is consistent with the government\u2019s ability to \u201ckeep cutting taxes\u201d. He mentions tax cuts already announced, but he seems to be hinting that the defence spending announcement does not mean that further tax cuts won\u2019t be included in the Tory election manifesto. UPDATE: Sunak said: The plan that I announced yesterday, it\u2019s fully funded. It\u2019s funded, rightly with a reduction in civil service headcount back to 2019 levels. Snce then we\u2019ve seen a very significant rise that isn\u2019t sustainable or needed. The chancellor has conducted a detailed exercise, he announced this at the end of last year, that exercise is completed, and that\u2019s what gives us the confidence that we can release the savings needed to fund our defence plan, combined with an uplift in R&amp;S spending, which we have already budgeted for \u2026 It is the biggest strengthening of our national defence in a generation. It is fully funded. And it is based on the fact that we have a strong economy and an economic plan that is working \u2026 And it\u2019s because our economic plan is working that I\u2019m able to make these announcements and they are entirely consistent with our ability to keep cutting people\u2019s taxes. PMQs is has finished, and the press conference in Berlin is just starting. We should have a live feed at the top of the blog soon. As for PMQs? Very snap verdict \u2013 Angela Rayner has not been taken down by \u201chousegate\u201d, and she is still functioning effectively as an attack machine. It wasn\u2019t her best performance, and if the best line she can come up with about Rishi Sunak is that he is a \u201cpint-sized loser\u201d, she really needs to try harder. Surely it\u2019s time to abandon jibes about height. But she dealt with the attacks on her housing arrangements fairly effectively. She raised the issue before he did, and used it as a pivot into a question about the renters (reform) bill, where Dowden ended up giving a thin defence of legislation that does not do what it is meant to do. Rayner said: I know this party opposite is desperate to talk about my living arrangements, but the public want to know what this government is going to do about theirs. And she was right. Chi Onwurah (Lab) says a constituent who gets the carer\u2019s allowance made a mistake, and now faces a bill for \u00a34,000. But the science secretary, Michelle Donelan, works as a part-time woke detector. She made a mistake, and cost the taxpayer tens of thousands, but has not had to pay that back. Why? Dowden ignores the Donelan part of the question, but says the DWP should look into cases where mistakes have been made. John Baron (Con) welcomes the extra money going on defence. But he says some of the funding should go on wages to help with recruitment. Dowden says the government is putting the money in to allow the army to deal with the challenges the country faces. He says recruitment is going up. Sally-Ann Hart (Con) asks about her local Labour council. There has been a lot of that today. The local elections are a week tomorrow. Dowden claims there are serious concerns about Labour councillors in Hastings. Jeff Smith (Lab) says Dowden said earlier that Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt restored economic stability. Who does he think caused the instability? This causes widespread laughter, and even Dowden seems to see the funny side. He ignores the question and says, when the Tories took office, Labour left a note saying there was no money left. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, asks about shoplifting in his constituency, and he mentions particular problems being faced by a Boots store. This is not a petty crime, he says. The government should take this more seriously. Dowden claims the government is already taking this seriously. Matt Western (Lab) asks about the Tees Valley mayor, Ben Houchen. He says Houchen has given away assets that should have belonged to the community to businessmen via his Teesworks development programme. Dowden says Houchen has never imposed a precept on local taxpayers as mayor. Sarah Jones (Lab) says Susan Hall, the Tory candidate for London mayor, has endorsed Islamaphobic tropes on social media, defended Enoch Powell and said black communities have a problem with crime. Can Dowden really support her? Dowden ignores the points Jones raised, and attacks Sadiq Khan\u2019s record on crime. Virginia Crosbie (Con) asks if the government will support a third bridge to Anglesey, her constituency. Dowden criticises the Welsh government for not prioritising new roads. Mhairi Black, the deputy leader of the SNP, says when mass graves were discovered in Ukraine, the Commons was united in condemndation. Yesterday Palestinian officials uncovered two mass graves outside the bombed hosptials in Gaza. This is also a war crime, isn\u2019t it? Dowden says the government expects Israel to investigate allegations of misconduct, and that is what it is doing. But he says he is surprised Black is comparing Israel to Russia. Black says the mere suspicion of war crimes should be enough for arms sales to be suspended. Dowden says Israel is investigating these deaths. And he says the government recently considered the case for arms sales to Israel, and decided they could continue. UPDATE: I\u2019ve posted a fuller version of the exchange, with the direct quotes, at 3.31pm. Rayner says both parties want defence spending to go up to 2.5%. But it is the Tories who have cut the size of the army to its smallest size since the Napoleon era. She refers to reports claiming Dowden is recommending an early election to minimise Tory loses. When Dowden ditched Boris Johnson, did he realise the party was getting rid of its best election winner for a \u201cpint-sized loser\u201d. Dowden ends with another jibe at Rayner\u2019s housing arrangements. Rayner says, unlike Dowden, she thinks housing is an issue for people. She says Tory councils have also faced bankruptcy proceedings. People are at risk of losing their homes because of Liz Truss\u2019s mini budget. But Truss says it was her proudest moment. Since she won\u2019t apologise, will Dowden? Dowden says the PM and the chancellor have brought inflation down. And they have promised the biggest increase in defence spending for a generation. Labour won\u2019t say if it will match it. Rayner voted to scrap Trident, she says. Rayner says Dowden has not read the leasehold legislation. The ban will not affect many people. It is like banning non-doms, but exempting the PM. She says Andy Street has only built a tiny number of social homes as West Midlands mayor. Dowden criticises the record of the Labour council in Birmingham. Tory mayors deliver more for less, he claims. Rayner says the bill does not do that. When will the government end leasehold for flats? Dowden says the government is addressing this. He says government policies can only be paid for with a strong economy. But Rayner\u2019s employment reforms would open the door to \u201cFrench-style wildcat strikes\u201d. And the one Thatcherite reform Rayner will not repeal is the right to buy your council house. Rayner says Dowden has not read the bill. The minister cannot say when no-fault evicitions will be ended. When will it be? Dowden says they are voting today. Angela Rayner says Frank Field was a good friend and colleague. She pays tribute. Tories are obsessed with her living arrangements, she says. But she says people are interested in what the government will do about theirs. She mentions the case of someone facing eviction, and asks what the Tories are doing to get rid of no-fault evictions. Dowden says it is a pleasure to be facing Rayner again at PMQs. Any more sessions like this and she will be claiming this is her primary residence. He says MPs are voting on no-fault evictions today. Jonathan Gullis (Con) lists some of the things he has done as an MP for his constituents. But Labour-led Stoke council have undermined by what he has done through various measures, he claims. Crime and anti-social behaviour are increasing because of where the council is \u201cdumping\u201d people. He asks if Dowden agrees that Stoke-on-Trent Labour should \u201caxe the garden tax\u201d. Sir Lindsay Hoyle interrupts Gullis, saying he has gone on enough. Dowden says there is not much he can add. But he claims Labour councils across the council are letting people down. And Gullis is right in \u201cholding rogue landlords to account\u201d, he says. That is his first reference to Angela Rayner. Oliver Dowden starts by saying MPs will want to offer their condolences to the family and friends of Frank Field. He was an outstanding parliamentarian, he says. And he wishes the Jewish community a happy Passover. It is a celebration of freedom, he says. But he says we remember the hostages in Gaza. Nigel Farage will be allowed to present his nightly GB News programme throughout the general election campaign, Ofcom has confirmed, after the media regulator said there was no clear desire among the British public to stop politicians presenting shows on news channels. Jim Waterson has the story here. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question at PMQs. Jonathan Gullis, who is down to ask the first question, is a deputy chair of the Conservative party and one of the Tories who has been most critical of Angela Rayner on social media. He may be tempted to use his slot to get \u201chousegate\u201d on to the agenda before the Rayner/Dowden exchanges start. But, judging by his post on X this morning, he made ask something of more interest to his constituents. We would like to hear from readers who have a memory to share of Frank Field. If you are interested, please submit a contribution here. With Rishi Sunak in Berlin, it is deputies\u2019 day at PMQs, and Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, will be facing questions from Angela Rayner, Labour\u2019s deputy leader. It will be her first time at the despatch box since it was announced that Greater Manchester is fully investigating various allegations relating to the council house she bought and sold before she became an MP, and where she was living during that period. It has been reported that at least a dozen officers are on the case. Rayner does not have to firm up her position with Labour MPs. She insists that she has done nothing wrong, and most people in the party believe that that the allegtions being made against her are little more than a smear (as Keir Starmer put it at PMQs last week). But the Conservatives believe that the controversy \u2013 confected or otherwise \u2013 is working to their advantage. It has put Labour on the defensive, and it is filling a lot of print media space that might otherwise be taken up by stories more advantageous to Starmer. In the past Rayner has been very effective as a critic of the Tories at PMQs. Today we may not learn anything new in relation to the substance of the allegations against her, but we may get a sense of whether or not her firepower has been diminished as a result of the row. Frank Field was director of the Child Poverty Action Group from 1969 to 1979. During that period the CPAG was instrumental in persuading the Labour government to introduce child benefit, which Field described in his memoir, Politics, Poverty and Belief, as \u201cthe largest direct redistrubition of income to poorer families since the introduction of the welfare state\u201d. In a tribute Alison Garnham, the current head of the CPAG, said: Frank was a steadfast, highly successful and diligent campaigner against child poverty. It is largely down to Frank that we have child benefit today, a truly towering achievement. He gained support and respect from across the political spectrum and defined the concept of the \u2018poverty trap\u2019, now commonly used to describe the difficulties for working people of getting better off while claiming means-tested benefits because of the high rate at which benefits are withdrawn as earnings rise. As CPAG director, Frank also helped pave the way for the minimum wage, free school meals and rent allowances for low-income families, all fundamental social protections. Frank was a true champion for children and low-income families and with child poverty at a record high today, families need his like as never before. He will be greatly missed. Our deep sympathy and condolences to those closest to him. The government says it will fund its proposed increase in defence spending (see 10.38am) partly by getting rid of 72,000 civil service jobs. Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, told Times Radio this morning: That actually will take the civil service back to where it was before Covid, so I think that is a very reasonable thing to do. Fran Heathcote, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, which represents civil servants, said the PCS would fight these plans \u201ctooth and nail\u201d. He said: Yet again ministers shamefully see fit to scapegoat their own workforce. It\u2019s not right for our members to pay for a rise in defence spending with their jobs, so we\u2019ll fight these proposals tooth and nail, just as we fought them under Boris Johnson. Ben Zaranko, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, has criticised the government for presenting its pledge to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP as a \u00a375bn increase. He posted these on X. It\u2019s only a \u201c\u00a375 billion increase\u201d over 6 years if you assume that spending would otherwise have been frozen in cash terms for 6 years - i.e. only if the government was, until today, planning to breach its NATO commitments. This is such an unhelpful way to present the figures To get the \u00a375 billion number, the government has assumed a baseline with spending frozen in cash terms and then added up all of the differences. If you instead assume a baseline of spending frozen as a % GDP, it\u2019s an extra \u00a320 billion over 6 years. Details here. To make matters worse, when briefing the press the government said that this would \u201conly\u201d cost \u00a34.4 billion in 2028/29. That assumes a baseline of 2.3% of GDP and so is inconsistent with the \u00a375 billion number. They\u2019re just picking whichever baseline suits best. Keir Starmer has said the death of Frank Field is \u201ca profound loss to politics and to our nation\u201d. In a tribute to the former minister, Starmer went on: Frank dedicated his life to being a voice for the most vulnerable and marginalised people in the country. Frank was principled, courageous, and independent-minded. He cared about the people he served, thought deeply about the issues he championed, and worked entirely for the good of the people of Birkenhead as their MP for 40 years. His honour and integrity were well known and admired. On behalf of the Labour party, my thoughts are with his family. All Nato countries should boost their defence spending to 2.5% of their GDP to meet the demands of a \u201cmore dangerous world\u201d, Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, has said. Aletha Adu has the story here. And here are more tributes to Frank Field from people who worked with him or knew him professionally. From Alastair Campbell, the podcaster, writer and former No 10 communications director From the former Downing Street adviser John McTernan From the journalist Philip Collins From the former Daily Mirror journalist Ben Glaze From the broadcaster Paul Lewis From the BBC\u2019s education editor Branwen Jeffreys The UK has been accused by Amnesty International of \u201cdeliberately destabilising\u201d human rights on the global stage for its own political ends. As Karen McVeigh reports, in its annual global report, released today, Amnesty said Britain was weakening human rights protections nationally and globally, amid a near-breakdown of international law. Here is Karen\u2019s full story. Here are tributes to Frank Field from MPs, former MPs and peers. From Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary From Diana Johnson, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee From Margaret Hodge, the former Labour minister and former chair of the Commons public accounts committee From Nadhim Zahawi, the Tory former chancellor From John Mann, the peer and former Labour MP From Steve Webb, the former Lib Dem pensions minister From Angela Eagle, the Labour MP whose Liverpool constituency was next to Field\u2019s. From the former Tory minister Tracey Crouch From John Glen, the Cabinet Office minister From Priti Patel, the former Tory home secretary From Sarah Champion, Labour chair of the interntional development committee From Labour MP Karen Buck From the Tory former minister Tim Loughton From Zac Goldsmith, the Tory former Foreign Office minister Good morning. Tony Blair, the former Labour figure, has been among the many figures this morning paying tribute to Frank Field, the former Labour MP and campaigner against poverty, who has died at the age of 81, after a long illness. Field was appointed minister for welfare reform when Blair became prime minister in 1997. It was a surprise appointment, because Field had not been a frontbencher and his proposals for welfare (often hard to place on a conventional left/right spectrum) were generally assumed to be too radical for his party. And so it proved; he clashed with Gordon Brown, the chancellor, and was out of office within about a year. But Field is a good example of how politicians don\u2019t have to be in government to make a difference. As director of the Child Poverty Action Group before he became an MP and as a backbencher, particularly as chair of the social security select committtee before Labour took power in 1997 and as a chair of the work and pensions select committee during the Brexit years, he had a huge influence on debates on welfare policy for decades. And at a time when members of the public despair at the quality of MPs, he was a model of integrity and commitment to public: a person of deep faith, passionate and tireless when it came working on behalf of those, much liked, and capable of working with colleagues from all parties. Blair said of him this morning. Frank had integrity, intelligence and deep commitment to the causes he believed in. He was an independent thinker, never constrained by conventional wisdom, but always pushing at the frontier of new ideas. Even when we disagreed, I had the utmost respect for him as a colleague and a character. Whether in his work on child poverty, or in his time devoted to the reform of our welfare system, he stood up and stood out for the passion and insight he brought to any subject. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, has also released this tribute. As a former colleague, I watched in admiration as Frank Field navigated a career as a formidable MP, and as a minister, tasked with \u2018thinking the unthinkable\u2019 on social care. He was neither cowed by the establishment or whips - which made his campaigns against hunger and food poverty, for climate change and the church, even more effective. He was the driving force behind Parliament\u2019s commitment to prevent slavery and human trafficking within our supply chains. Having worked with him on the modern slavery advisory group, and made him its chair, I am in no doubt his efforts saved many lives nationwide from this shameful criminal activity. Suffice to say, he was one of a kind and he will be sorely missed. I will post more tributes soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 12pm: Oliver Dowden, deputy prime minister, faces Angela Rayner, deputy Labour leader, at PMQs. 12.45pm: Rishi Sunak holds a press conference in Berlin with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. After 12.45pm: MPs resume their debate on the renters (reform) bill. And David Cameron, the foreign secretary, is flying to Kazakhstan as he continues his tour of Central Asia.

            "title": "World leaders have a chance to raise taxes for rich people like me. I\u2019m begging them to take it | Abigail Disney",
            "date": "2024-04-18T10:00:26Z",
            "content": "The need to tax rich people like me has never been so dire. Extreme wealth concentration in the hands of a few oligarchs is a threat to democracy the world over. Meanwhile, we are cooking our planet and irreversibly damaging our biosphere. Last summer was the hottest on record, and we\u2019re also seeing historic wildfires, biblical floods, devastating droughts and rising sea temperatures. It is only right that the funds to mitigate further damage and develop green energy systems come from those most able to pay \u2013 and who, by the way, are the ones disproportionately driving it with their jet-setting, gas-guzzling lifestyles. This week, finance ministers and central-bank governors from G20 countries will meet in Washington DC at the spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). They will have a chance to commit to raising the taxes of wealthy people. At the recent S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil meeting in February this year, economists and G20 finance leaders floated the idea of instituting a global minimum tax on the world\u2019s billionaires, who are now more abundant in number (2,781) and in combined wealth ($14.2tn) than ever before. This tracks with countless recommendations and requests from economists and communities all over the world, including a proposal for a 2% tax on billionaires from the EU Tax Observatory in its groundbreaking report last year. Finance ministers from both Brazil and France came out publicly in support of this idea, and a handful of other countries have quietly assured activists they are supportive of the policy framework. Movement in the G20 to tackle this issue is a small sign of progress. But for nearly two decades, I have been calling on the US to raise my and other wealthy Americans\u2019 taxes. In that time, however, the global economy has become increasingly interconnected, which has made it easier than ever for the ultra-wealthy to move their capital to avoid paying taxes. The result is that billionaires now get away with paying lower tax rates than all other income groups. So any serious attempts to rein in increasing wealth inequality must be international in scope. G20 countries have no option but to work together if they want to institute minimum standards for taxing the rich. Instituting a global minimum tax on billionaires will undoubtedly be complex, but it is not impossible. Just three years ago, after decades of hard-fought negotiations, 136 OECD countries joined an accord to enact a 15% global minimum tax on multinational corporations. If we can institute a tax floor for the world\u2019s largest corporations, there is no reason we can\u2019t do the same for the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals. There is another tangible and immediate threat posed by extreme wealth concentration. As inequality has spiralled out of control, millions of economically disfranchised people around the world are turning their backs on democracy in favour of authoritarian and rightwing demagogues. Voters believe the system is rigged against them (and they\u2019re right), but authoritarians wield that energy to attack democratic institutions, figuratively and literally. As we saw with the January 6 Capitol attack and in the January 2023 assault on the Brazilian federal buildings, far-right extremists can weaponise anger and erode or destroy the guardrails of democracy. If the G20 works to tackle extreme wealth around the world, it can buttress our beleaguered democratic institutions and put a check on social unrest. So what is getting in the way? It can\u2019t be a lack of public support. Between 2017 and 2022, public polls in all G20 countries indicated strong backing for reducing inequality and raising taxes on the rich. A 2023 survey found that even millionaires in G20 countries are supportive of raising taxes. And finally, this week, a group called Patriotic Millionaires, of which I am a part, sponsored eye-popping projections on the buildings of the IMF and the World Bank to spotlight our support for raising taxes on ourselves. While it is promising that economic powerhouses such as France and Brazil support instituting a global minimum tax on the world\u2019s richest people, there are conspicuous voices missing, including that of my own economic representative, the US treasury secretary Janet Yellen. Yellen has yet to express her support for this being added to the G20 agenda. It would be an unforced error to allow the US, and other leading economies in the G20, to be caught flat-footed while Brazil and France lead the charge. Supporting this international process would demonstrate the US\u2019s \u2013 and Joe Biden\u2019s \u2013 commitment to requiring the rich to pay their fair share of taxes while promoting a stronger and fairer economy. As I said, this issue polls well. It\u2019s no secret that Biden could certainly use the assistance. Again, we are making progress. But the work has just begun. The spring meetings provide an opportunity for the G20 nations generally, and the US specifically, to strengthen their resolve to save the planet and safeguard our democracies. The first step in doing so involves taxing the rich. If a millionaire like me from one of the most famous families on Earth wants wealthy people to pay more in taxes, there is no reason or excuse for the G20 to ignore our pleas. Abigail Disney is a documentary film-maker, activist and member of Patriotic Millionaires"

            "date": "2024-04-10T12:00:02Z",
            "content": "A British man with Parkinson\u2019s disease and his wife living in France say they have been left stranded on the continent because of \u201cinsulting\u201d post-Brexit immigration rules. They worked and paid taxes for decades in the UK but say they have had the \u201cdoor slammed in our faces\u201d and have been told they must pay \u00a311,000 if they want to return. Stephen Kaye, 60, an IT specialist, spent his entire working career paying tax in the UK, and his French wife, Carmen Delaunay, 64, made substantial contributions working as an analyst and client retention specialist for multinationals, most recently Deloitte, over 25 years in Britain. They decided to move to France to look after Delaunay\u2019s elderly father in 2015, and all of her tax years in the UK were wiped away with new immigration rules that came in after 2021. The new rules prohibited EU citizens from entering freely into the UK unless they had an unbroken five-year residency in Britain before the divorce from the EU. Kaye said: \u201cMy first reaction upon discovering that Carmen did not have an automatic right to return to England was one of disbelief. It did not seem possible that a \u2018civilised\u2019 country (the UK) could invent such an outrageous rule. \u201cMy view was that a British citizen should have the right to marry a person of any nationality and be able to live with that person indefinitely in the UK. It is as simple as that. I can understand that the UK would want to disallow \u2018staged\u2019 marriages, but that is clearly not the case for Carmen and me [married in the UK in 2012].\u201d The couple are sharing their story to highlight what they consider to be the injustice of Brexit and in the hope of persuading the government that peoplesuch as them should not be \u201clandlocked\u201d in the country the British spouse is in. Delaunay is an only child and when her father became ill in 2015 the couple moved to France to look after him. He died in 2018. After Kaye was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s in 2021, the couple decided to look at returning to the UK as his ability to communicate in French was compromised by the condition. Delaunay worried that as they had no children, he would be more vulnerable in France if anything happened to her. \u201cIt had become a little harder for him to understand French unless he really concentrated, so we started to look at going back to the UK,\u201d she said. They were told they would have to pay \u00a311,000 for a visa for her, despite their shared history and decades of contributions to the UK tax and national insurance systems. \u201cThe door is closed to us. We are being treated like newcomers that have never been in the country. It is insulting and unfair,\u201d Delaunay said. \u201cStephen\u2019s illness has made him more vulnerable and that is exactly when the door should be open. To find the door slammed in your face is really upsetting. The rules don\u2019t take account of life. Things happen, things change.\u201d Campaigners at British in Europe, a coalition of ad hoc organisations that set up in countries across Europe to protect the rights of British people in the EU before Brexit, had warned the government for years of the risk of cases like Kaye and Delaunay\u2019s. Under the Brexit agreement, British citizens who had settled in an EU member state before Brexit had the right to remain in that country but did not have the right to return to the UK with an EU spouse without being routed through the visa system. The Home Office declined to comment on the case but said EU citizens who had lived in the UK before Brexit but had been away for more than five years without any visits back even for a short period of time were not eligible for the EU citizens settlement scheme. \u201cApplicants who have been absent from the UK for an extended period may not be eligible to apply for EUSS but there are other visa options available for non-British citizens wanting to live in the UK with a British spouse,\u201d a spokesperson said."

            "content": "Opponents of Myanmar\u2019s military said they had carried out drone attacks against junta sites in the capital, Naypyidaw, in what appears to be a rare incursion against the embattled junta\u2019s centre of power. The National Unity Government (NUG), which was formed to oppose the 2021 coup, said it had launched drone attacks on two military targets in the capital. \u201cThe synchronised drone operations were simultaneously executed against Naypyidaw, targeting both the headquarters of the terrorist military and Alar airbase,\u201d the NUG said in a statement. \u201cPreliminary reports suggest there were casualties,\u201d it added. The military said it shot down seven drones and there were no reports of casualties. It is not possible to verify the details of the attack. The military is fighting myriad opponents on multiple fronts across the country, and has faced humiliating battlefield losses over recent months, including losing ground in Rakhine state and along the border with India and China. Thousands of its soldiers have surrendered, describing rock-bottom morale, and pro-military figures have expressed dissatisfaction with the leadership. The country was plunged into conflict after the 2021 coup, which was strongly opposed by the public. Many civilians took up arms and joined people\u2019s defence forces to fight the military, and some of these groups have received support from older ethnic armed groups that have long fought for independence. Many defence forces are aligned with the NUG. The resistance group that claimed responsibility for the drone attack, Kloud Team (Shar Htoo Waw), said it targeted the house of the junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing, as well as the military headquarters and airbase. Kloud Team specialises in the use of drones, which have proven a cheap and effective weapon for anti-coup groups, which, unlike the military, do not have an air force. The military has repeatedly been accused of using its air power to indiscriminately bomb civilians, including medical facilities, hospitals and schools. It has rejected this, saying it is targeting \u201cterrorists\u201d. Naypyidaw, the centre of the military\u2019s power, has been relatively calm compared with swathes of the country that are gripped by fighting. Last week, Min Aung Hlaing presided over a military parade there to mark Armed Forces Day, though the event was far less grand than in previous years, according to reports by Agence France-Presse, with no tanks or missile launchers making the drive-by. The military announced in February that it would impose a mandatory conscription law, under which men aged 18 to 35, or up to 45 in the case of professionals, would be conscripted. Women aged 18 to 27, or professionals up to 35, can also be conscripted under the law \u2013 though the military has said they will not be required to serve for now. Commentators say the move reflects the devastating losses the military has recently faced, including the surrender ofentire battalions. The announcement has horrified young people and prompted large numbers to search for ways to flee the country or go to resistance-controlled areas. According to the UN, as of the end of February 2024 more than 2.4 million people have become internally displaced in Myanmar since the coup and 59,300 people have fled to neighbouring countries."

            "date": "2024-04-24T11:21:42Z",
            "content": "Claudette Johnson has been nominated for this year\u2019s Turner prize for her work, which includes a portrait of the African-American slavery abolitionist Sarah Parker Remond commissioned as part of the Guardian\u2019s award-winning Cotton Capital series. Pio Abad, Johnson, Jasleen Kaur and Delaine Le Bas will compete for the \u00a325,000 prize, while the nominated artists will each collect \u00a310,000 as the prize returns to Tate Britain for the first time in six years. Colonialism, migration, nationalism and identity politics are the key themes running through the 40th edition of the Turner prize, which the jury described as showing contemporary British art \u201cis appealing and dynamic as ever\u201d. Alex Farquharson, the director of Tate Britain and chair of the Turner prize jury, said this year\u2019s nominees were exploring ideas of identity and would be exhibited from 25 September, before the jury\u2019s final choice. He said: \u201cThis year\u2019s shortlisted artists can be broadly characterised as exploring questions of identity, autobiography, community and the self in relation to memory, or history or myth.\u201d The Turner prize, regarded as one of the art world\u2019s most prestigious awards, is presented to an artist born or working in Britain for an outstanding exhibition or presentation of their work over the previous year. Abad was nominated for his solo exhibition To Those Sitting in Darkness at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, with the jury commenting on the \u201cprecision and elegance\u201d of his work, which takes its title from a Mark Twain poem of a similar name that critiques American imperialism the Philippines, his homeland. The show also contains references to the Benin Bronzes, after Abad discovered that the punitive expedition of 1897 \u2013 during which British troops sacked Benin City and looted thousands of objects, of which about 900 are in the British Museum\u2019 \u2013 set off from his home, Woolwich, in south London. Johnson was nominated for her solo Presence exhibition at the Courtauld Gallery, which the Guardian said \u201cbrilliantly questions depictions of non-white figures by such revered painters as Gauguin and Picasso\u201d. She was also recognised for her New York show, Drawn Out, at Ortuzar Projects, which included her Redmond portrait. She is the latest black female artist who emerged in the Black Art Movement of the 1980s to be recognised by the Turner prize, following in the footsteps of Lubaina Himid (2017 winner) and Veronica Ryan (2022), while Ingrid Pollard and Barbara Walker have both been nominated. The jury said Johnson had been nominated because of the \u201crenewal of her practice\u201d, after she stopped making work in the 1990s, and the fact she was still \u201ctaking risks and trying new forms of practice\u201d. Kaur\u2019s work in the exhibition Alter Altar, which was shown at Tramway in Glasgow, features sculptures and soundscapes, including a red Ford Escort covered in a huge doily, which references her father\u2019s first car and ideas of migration and belonging in Britain. Kaur grew up in Glasgow\u2019s Sikh community in Pollokshields, and the jury said the exhibition was a breakout show that was \u201cgenerous, celebratory, moving and alive to timely issues, speaking imaginatively to how we might live together in a world increasingly marked by nationalism, division and social control\u201d. Le Bas\u2019s work, shown at the Vienna Secession exhibition, was described as a \u201cresponse to social and political turmoil\u201d and includes immersive performance art with theatrical costumes and sculptures. Farquharson said there was a chance the show may travel to Bradford during its City of Culture year, following the precedent set by Coventry, which hosted the awards in 2021, although that was still \u201cto be confirmed\u201d."

            "date": "2024-04-15T14:22:13Z",
            "content": "If the age-old story is correct, the Hampshire village of Little London gets its evocative name from the flight of fearful residents from the capital during the Great Plague of 1665-1666. But today\u2019s inhabitants are up in arms at the prospect of a 21st-century exodus from London to their tucked away settlement. They are upset that wealthy newcomers are eyeing up homes that most local people cannot afford and are warning would-be neighbours that Little London offers little and lacks the infrastructure to cope. The village, which is located in countryside north of Basingstoke, has precious few amenities apart from one pub, the Plough, and a population of only a few hundred. Resident Carol Donner, 65, said: \u201cWe have got this sign that says: \u2018Welcome to Little London.\u2019 We were going to put a sign underneath it and say: \u2018Twinned with Greater London.\u2019\u201d Donner, a retired teacher, said she and other villagers were working together to try stop the overdevelopment of Little London. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a few of us that are getting together and we have met up and come up with ideas and things we need to do. None of them are what we call nimby, they are people that have their heart and soul in the countryside and want to protect that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an ancient village, there\u2019s not many houses and it\u2019s got no infrastructure at all. They are coming from London because they want a country pad and they are going to concrete over here.\u201d Among the applications are plans for houses, battery storage facilities, and conversions of barns into business units and event venues. Donner added: \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous. There\u2019s no infrastructure, even if you thought you could build affordable houses, it\u2019s not the right place for them. It\u2019s greed over need and it\u2019s the wrong houses in the wrong place. Why can\u2019t people go and build affordable houses on brownfield sites that people can afford to buy? \u201cI looked at all the houses for sale within a two-and-a-half-mile radius and I stopped counting \u2026 25 houses all over \u00a3700,000. No sooner is the ink dry on one application than another one pops up.\u201d A plan to build three detached houses in Little London is one of the new applications that sparked a protest from residents. Tom Cullum, a carpenter and joiner who has lived in Little London for 37 years, said: \u201cIt\u2019s just horrendous. The village is being infilled by houses \u2013 really expensive houses \u2013 over \u00a3700,000 to \u00a3800,000, and they\u2019re filling in the spaces. It\u2019s just gone crazy in this village and the traffic has doubled. \u201cThe type of houses that are being built, local villagers couldn\u2019t afford them anyway. They\u2019re [for] people from London, I would have thought, businesspeople who want to come and live in a rural village.\u201d Kevin Chatburn, 69, the chair of the Tadley and Pamber Rural Protection group, which takes in Little London, said: \u201cAll of the houses that are being proposed in Pamber are typically \u00a3750,000 to \u00a31.25m, so they\u2019re being purchased by people from outside the area. \u201cThey are not providing dwellings for those who are already living in the area, particularly young people. I\u2019ve got relatives in their 30s and they have all moved out of the area completely because they can\u2019t buy anything here.\u201d Little London is close to Pamber Forest, which is described by the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust as \u201ca beautiful ancient woodland bursting with wildlife\u201d. Objecting to one of the proposals on the Basingstoke and Deane borough council planning portal, Gary Hills said: \u201cThe proposed development is another attempt to extend the village into the surrounding farmland.\u201d On behalf of Pamber parish council, Chris Gunnell, a clerk, wrote: \u201cThere is no local need. At present there are at least 17 properties for sale in the area, there are 13 properties under construction in the parish and 30 yet to be constructed that have planning permission granted.\u201d There are a number of villages called Little London. Some also think the name may stem from the arrival of seasonal workers from the capital to work in the fields. It may also be a corruption of a stream called Little Loddon."

            "content": "Couples in Bogot\u00e1 are being asked to shower together as water supplies are rationed in the Colombian capital. Major neighbourhoods were cut off from the water grid on Thursday to preserve dangerously low water levels at reservoirs that have been starved of rain by the weather phenomenon known as El Ni\u00f1o. \u201cShower as a couple,\u201d said the mayor of Bogot\u00e1, Carlos Fernando Gal\u00e1n. \u201cThis is an educational exercise in saving water, nothing else. That kind of thing is going to help us a lot. Those behavioral changes are key.\u201d Gal\u00e1n also asked residents to consider abandoning their daily hygiene practices entirely given the reservoirs were at \u201chistoric lows\u201d. \u201cIf you are not going to leave your house on Sunday or any other day of the week, take advantage of it and do not take a bath,\u201d he pleaded ahead of the water cuts. El Ni\u00f1o, which usually causes lower rainfall in South America, has caused record-breaking droughts and temperatures this year, forcing administrations across the region to enact emergency measures. Nestled in the Andes mountains 2,600m (8,500ft) above sea level, Bogot\u00e1 has been spared the most apocalyptic scenes. The usually rainy capital receives 1,020mm (40in) of rainfall each year on average \u2013 nearly twice as much as London. Still the abnormally long hot and dry spells have caused wildfires to rage in the forests surrounding the capital \u2013 choking some neighbourhoods with smoke \u2013 and now the reservoirs which some 10 million people rely on are at \u201ccritical\u201d levels. Supplies at the Chingaza reservoir, which supplies 70% of the capital\u2019s water, are at 16% \u2013 the lowest on record. Bogot\u00e1\u2019s public water utility estimates there could be about 54 days\u2019 worth of water left. To prevent a disaster, local officials have divided Bogot\u00e1 into nine zones, each of which will be cut off from the water grid for 24 hours on rotation. The mayor did not say how long the measures would last but asked Bogotanos to reduce consumption so they could be ended sooner. \u201cLet\u2019s not waste a drop of water in Bogot\u00e1 at this time,\u201d Gal\u00e1n told reporters this week. Bogota is not the only major Latin American city forced to take action to combat drought. Mexico City has also been rationing water supplies in the past month and Guatemala declared an emergency on Wednesday as it struggles to tame wildfires. Bogotanos were left wondering whether they should shower, for how long, and how many buckets to fill. Few will probably take up Gal\u00e1n\u2019s advice to stop bathing as Colombians are extremely hygiene conscious, said Mariana Garc\u00eda Achury, a 34-year-old in the capital who said she was bathing with a bucket to conserve water. \u201cI really don\u2019t think that is going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cOr at least if they do, they won\u2019t be telling anyone about it.\u201d"

            "content": "Jason Patric, played Michael Joel Schumacher, the director, wanted me in the movie right from the first time we met. But the script I read was nothing like the magical movie it would become after rewrites and production, and I had no interest in teenage vampire films. So I turned it down about five times \u2013 but Joel was determined. He spent weeks explaining his vision, a mix of horror and comedy, and eventually wore me down. We made a deal: he promised I wouldn\u2019t have to wear the makeup, the teeth or have to fly around. Of course, he lied. All these great people signed up: Dianne Wiest, who was about to win an Oscar for Hannah and Her Sisters, Edward Herrmann, Barnard Hughes, Kiefer Sutherland, Corey Haim and Corey Feldman. It was being shot by Michael Chapman, the cinematographer on Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. I had worked with Jami Gertz and put her forward to play Star. The role had been conceived of as a blond, waifish girl; I told Joel she could bring a sexy, darker quality to the film. We shot in Santa Cruz, California, for about a month. In the late 70s it was the murder capital of the world and had a bad reputation. The excitement of the boardwalk and homelessness across the city merged to create a creepy, carnival quality, like you might find a freak show around every corner. I\u2019d seen Corey (Haim) in Lucas. He was a big talent and had this open, affable personality. We read together for the part of my brother Sam and I told Joel: \u201cThat\u2019s the guy.\u201d He\u2019d come over to my house and we\u2019d play baseball and go to the pier, which created an unsaid physicality. We had a close bond and he was wonderfully imaginative in an improvisational way. We played off each other. Joel and I thought my character Michael should be the centre of the film and hold the fantasy, family and sexual elements together. This kid is an outsider, he\u2019s about to become a man and has to leave the family and he gets involved in this group that seems sexy and dangerous. It\u2019s a drug analogy: he drinks the blood and there\u2019s something addictive about it. His personality begins to change and there are things going on he doesn\u2019t understand. In part, Joel was the classic cliche of a screaming and authoritarian director, but he was also a great listener, and gave the young actors the freedom to create their characters. There wasn\u2019t a scene with Corey where we didn\u2019t discuss how to develop their relationship. It was the John Hughes era, when kids were the stars and not just supporting parts: the entire business paradigm shifted in the mid-80s. The iconic scene where we\u2019re hanging from a bridge was shot through the night on a real trestle near LA. We were about 100 feet up with a platform underneath us and the stage below was filled with smoke to create the fog clouds we fell through. It was exhausting. The Lost Boys has become The Wizard of Oz of horror movies \u2013 it\u2019s something that completely holds up today and that people watch every year. They feel a sense of kinship because it\u2019s about the idea of teen alienation. James Jeremias, writer I grew up in the San Fernando Valley and worked at Warner Bros as a grip on films including Blade Runner and Dead Men Don\u2019t Wear Plaid. Janice Fischer and I had met studying cinema together in LA, we wrote the script for The Lost Boys in about five months during 1984. We bought Syd Field\u2019s book Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting and drew a paradigm of our story across his three-act structure. I\u2019d read Interview With the Vampire by Anne Rice and was inspired by the little girl, Claudia, trapped in the body of a five-year-old for eternity. It got me thinking about JM Barrie\u2019s Peter Pan \u2013 where our title came from. What if the reason he came out at night, could fly and didn\u2019t grow up was because he was a vampire? We took a fictional character and put him in a new light. What if it wasn\u2019t all goodness and there was some evil intent? Warner Bros paid us $375,000 for the script. About a year later, we had a meeting with [original director, later executive producer] Richard Donner about rewrites. It was brutal. We had designed the film to be a boy\u2019s adventure, set in a time before sex rears its head. But that\u2019s not what the studio wanted. Donner wanted the boys to be old enough to drive. What he meant was old enough to fuck. He also wanted Star \u2013 whom we\u2019d written as a boy \u2013 to change sex and be the love interest. He was turning our story into a teenage vampire movie. Once we sold the script it was out of our hands. During filming, I went down to the Warner Bros lot. I was told it was a closed set and was asked to leave. But I was invited to the official cast and crew screening when it came out in 1987. I remember marvelling at it being the culmination of me sitting on my couch, smoking a joint and dreaming up this idea. The script had gone through a lot of changes but our story was still there. \u2022 The Lost Boys (35th Anniversary 4K Restoration) is out now"

Most remarkable is Keir Starmer\u2019s admiration for the \u201centrepreneurialism\u201d she let loose. Starmer is clearly stuck in his New Romantic era and hasn\u2019t done his history. The biggest burst of entrepreneurship came in the pre-Thatcher 1960s. The young Turks who burst into the music industry through the side door. The fashion revolution in Carnaby Street and Kings Road. The new magazines, including the very first glossy women\u2019s rights publication. And, sneering rightwingers might note, I don\u2019t think there was the proverbial politics of envy. I think we rather admired Terence Conran, whose airy Habitat emporiums offered well-designed homeware at affordable prices. It all made Britain suddenly world famous. The only entrepreneurial activity Thatcher let loose was in the late 1980s when, having devastated the northern industries, she and Nigel Lawson devised a way of kickstarting the economy by deregulating the financial sector and offering people criminally stupid amounts of credit \u2013 a gambit that predictably went pop in 1990 and contributed to her demise. Let\u2019s have less Daily Mail mythology and more accurate history please, Keir. David Redshaw Saltdean, East Sussex \u2022 In his excellent piece about Margaret Thatcher\u2019s ongoing influence, Andy Beckett has perhaps overlooked her most heinous sin. Her government, to the horror of Harold Macmillan, used the proceeds of privatisation not to invest in infrastructure or other capital projects but to fritter away on tax cuts and giving an illusion of an economic miracle. It did the same with North Sea oil revenues. Norway was the only other European country to have the great good fortune to become self-sufficient in the black gold. It used the rewards to improve its infrastructure and to build up a fund to protect against future economic problems. The Thatcher government frittered ours away just as it had when selling our national assets. Now instead the Tories are building up massive public debts, in effect stealing from future taxpayers. It\u2019s no surprise that we boomers are often despised for our lucky lives. In the 1980s, thanks to Thatcher and her acolytes, we stole from previous generations; the public companies we sold had been built up using money from millions of customers and taxpayers. Now we are in effect doing it to generations younger than ours. Brian Hughes Cheltenham, Gloucestershire \u2022 It is strange that those who have held frontbench office at Westminster since Boris Johnson\u2019s disastrous purge claim to be Thatcherites, for they are actually something startling different. Margaret Thatcher was always a remainer, like the purge\u2019s victims. While ambivalent to certain European institutions and policies, she was never, as Andy Beckett suggests she was, hostile to the entire project. She campaigned for reform from within \u2013 and sometimes achieved it, such as the common agricultural policy rebate. As an incumbent prime minister she fought \u2013 and defeated, preventing a 1980s Brexit \u2013 a Labour party far more hostile to the European project. So far from being Thatcherites, this decade\u2019s Conservative leadership are Footites, at least on Europe. Charles EL Gilman Mitcham, Surrey"

In return, the scavenger earned tolls from shopkeepers and traders. It could have worked well, except the contractor decided to cut costs and maximise profits by deploying just two carts rather than six. Dung piled up and the city stank. This upset everyone save the scavenger, who pocketed enough cash to set herself up as a moneylender. Her name was Catherine Strong. In 1635, the city fired her, ending an intriguing if inglorious career in public service. And then, like so many women of her era, Strong vanished into history, her entrepreneurship \u2013 creditable or otherwise \u2013 barely scraping a footnote in Irish chronicles written by men about men.

Jane Ohlmeyer, a history professor who is leading the project, titled Voices, said: \u201cWomen are largely absent from historical narratives, with the historical record privileging the perspectives of elites and elite men in particular. \u201cBut ordinary women are not absent from the story of early modern Ireland; they are hiding in plain sight in fragments and passing mentions across a multitude of historic records \u2013 wills, maps, surveys, records of debt and legal depositions.\u201d Historians, literary scholars, data analysts and computer scientists would collaborate in a groundbreaking effort to recover marginalised voices and \u2013 it is hoped \u2013 set an example for other overlooked narratives, such as the experience of women in colonial-era Latin America, said Ohlmeyer. \u201cOur approach is transferable and applicable to other countries.\u201d The five-year project, funded by a \u20ac2.5m (\u00a32.1m) European Research Council grant, will document the roles women played during social and political upheavals that included massacres, sexual violence and extreme trauma. AI and other tools will harvest names from sources such as legal records, inquisitions, censuses and statute staple records of lending and borrowing, amassing material that will be organised in a \u201cknowledge graph\u201d, an online resource that will be available to researchers and the public for free. \u201cThe documents will talk to each other so we can start to connect people. We\u2019re able to develop these profiles of people that previously were just a name,\u201d said Ohlmeyer. GPT-4 from OpenAI and the AI-driven text recognition tool Transkribus will help search and summarise material, albeit with human oversight of the technology. \u201cEverything still has to be checked; we don\u2019t trust it,\u201d said Ohlmeyer. Declan O\u2019Sullivan, a professor at Trinity\u2019s school of computer science, expressed confidence his department could turn the data into knowledge that was easily accessible to the public and researchers. The 1500-1700 period represented a transition from the medieval to the modern and coincided with the English empire expanding, said Ohlmeyer, the author of Making Empire: Ireland, Imperialism and the Early Modern World. \u201cFrom the late 16th century, colonialism really ramps up and gets tremendous momentum, especially in plantations. That\u2019s when we see Ireland becoming English through language, law and socioeconomic infrastructure.\u201d Civil wars created opportunities for women who, in the absence of men, found themselves becoming breadwinners and running businesses as brewers, moneylenders, tanners and tavern keepers. Catherine Strong, after being accused of presiding over \u201cfoulness of the streets\u201d, appeared as a creditor on the Dublin statute staple. However, conflicts also wreaked horrors. Depositions taken after a 1641 Catholic uprising showed widespread robbery, assault and rape that was often euphemised as \u201cstripping\u201d, said Ohlmeyer. In one statement, Amy Manfin, a Protestant settler, said she was forced to stand in the blood of her murdered husband before being stripped and dragged by the hair through thorns. English government forces were just as brutal. Other documents show women pursuing legal cases. In a battle with a debtor over a contested will, Joan Flynn in 1599 allegedly tricked Dublin\u2019s probate court into granting her power over her late husband\u2019s estate."

            "title": "How much is Elon Musk to blame for Tesla sales slip?",
            "date": "2024-04-03T16:04:02Z",
            "content": "For one Tesla investor, the cause of Tuesday\u2019s underwhelming sales figures was clear: the chief executive. \u201cBasically, Tesla can\u2019t sell its cars due to Elon\u2019s behaviour,\u201d wrote Ross Gerber, the chief executive of the investment management firm Gerber Kawasaki. \u201cLet\u2019s stop blaming the Houthi rebels or German environmental terrorists. Or a recession that never came. Or interest rates. Only one person responsible for this.\u201d Writing on X, the social media platform owned by the Tesla boss, Gerber appeared to pin the blame on Musk\u2019s antics on the same site. Gerber then added during an appearance on the Fox Business channel that the board of the carmaker had done nothing to stop Musk\u2019s \u201ctoxic\u201d behaviour on X that had \u201cabsolutely damaged the [Tesla] brand\u201d. Musk responded in typical style on X, calling Gerber an \u201cidiot\u201d who \u201ccan\u2019t even tell he\u2019s an idiot\u201d. Musk also pointed to slowing sales at Chinese rival BYD, saying it was a \u201ctough quarter for everyone\u201d. Gerber, a vocal critic of Musk, was responding to a sales update by Tesla on Tuesday that surprised Wall Street and triggered a 5% decline in the company\u2019s stock, compounding a fall in shares of more than 30% this year. Tesla said it had made approximately 387,000 deliveries to customers in the first quarter of 2024, missing market expectations by about 13%. It was its first fall in deliveries in nearly four years and the company cited factory shutdowns caused by shipping delays resulting from Houthi rebels\u2019 attacks in the Red Sea and an arson attack at a Tesla plant in Berlin as mitigating factors. Another factor was the introduction of an updated version of Tesla\u2019s Model 3 car at its Fremont site in the US. However, the fact that there was greater percentage decline in deliveries than factory production indicated a problem with demand. \u201cThere were some unique factors that impacted production in the quarter, but we believe demand is slowing,\u201d wrote analysts at the investment bank UBS. \u201cShowing a [year-on-year] delivery decline, especially at a rate greater than production decline, will do little to ease market concerns over growth.\u201d Musk may have lost the title of world\u2019s richest person, but his global fame, sustained in part by his divisive online persona, is undiminished. Mark Borkowski, a PR consultant and author, said the Tesla boss exemplified the \u201cPT Barnum-esque\u201d approach to modern entrepreneurship. \u201cEverything in this cult of personality is fragile,\u201d Borkowski said, but added that Musk had proven before that he can \u201cre-spawn\u201d when he encountered difficulties. That fame has prompted some analysts to warn that Musk\u2019s controversial behaviour \u2013 from endorsing antisemitic tweets to reinstating previously banned accounts on X \u2013 is affecting Tesla sales, particularly in the US, the carmaker\u2019s largest market. Musk has been \u201cdistancing himself by his actions\u201d from one group of buyers, according to Gene Munster, a managing partner of the US firm Deepwater Asset Management. Munster said there was was likely to be \u201can equal-sized group\u201d that was \u201cprobably turned on by Elon\u201d and some of the things that he did. Musk\u2019s behaviour was likely to be a \u201cslight negative\u201d for US sales, Munster continued, adding that the bigger impact came from higher interest rates and a dimming of consumer excitement over electric vehicles. Writing on X, Munster said he believed Tesla\u2019s problems would pass because it was making the right decisions for the long run. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that Tesla was about to scout locations in India for a $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) to $3bn manufacturing plant that it hoped to build. Daniel Ives, the managing director at US financial services company Wedbush Securities, was alarmed by the sales figures, describing them as an \u201cunmitigated disaster\u201d that was hard to explain away. Ives did not believe that Musk\u2019s divisive showmanship was the main reason for the dip. He said the core issues were the softening of global demand for electric vehicles and problems in China, Tesla\u2019s second biggest market, where he estimated that deliveries fell by at least 3% compared with the previous year. However, Ives ascribed some impact to Musk, warning that the Tesla boss was \u201cputting gasoline on the fire\u201d. He argued that 70% of the first-quarter \u201ctrain wreck\u201d was related to China and an easing in EV demand worldwide, adding: \u201cThirty per cent of the Tesla issues in my view is Musk-driven at this point, with potential customers driven away by his antics..\u201d Other analysts were emphatic that Musk\u2019s X feed did not influence sales. \u201cI would say that the impact of his personality is minimal. We live in a digitised period of hyper-short-termism now, and Elon\u2019s tweet is yesterday\u2019s tweet,\u201d said Matthias Schmidt, an automotive industry analyst. Marina Alekseenkova, a director at Hypothesis Research, said she believed Tesla remained in a \u201crelatively strong\u201d position and that the poor update was down to one-off issues. \u201cI do not believe that people\u2019s choices depend on what is on X,\u201d she added. For once, Musk might be grateful for the lack of attention. Tesla was contacted for comment."

            "title": "How one Wisconsin man plagued election offices and stoked mistrust",
            "date": "2024-04-27T16:00:39Z",
            "content": "Peter Bernegger has spent the last three and a half years bombarding local election offices in Wisconsin with litigation and accusations of fraud. He\u2019s brought at least 18 lawsuits against election clerks and offices in state court, and on social media, he has relentlessly promoted his litigation and circulated false claims about election fraud in the swing state. His campaign has recently landed him in legal trouble \u2013 Bernegger now faces criminal charges for allegedly falsifying a subpoena in connection with a lawsuit against the state\u2019s top election office. It\u2019s an escalation for the 61-year-old activist from New London, Wisconsin, who according to court documents, interviews with election officials and emails obtained by the Guardian, has drained election offices of already-limited resources and stoked mistrust in the electoral process in his years-long quest to uncover election fraud. In the universe of activists who dispute the results of the 2020 election and have spent years searching for evidence of widespread voter fraud, Bernegger\u2019s star power is small. He has not served on a Trump campaign team, no high-powered conservative law firms have taken on his cases and his media appearances are mostly relegated to interviews with fringe podcasts on the rightwing YouTube alternative Rumble. But his efforts prove that in a country where election offices are chronically underfunded and heavily scrutinized, a single, relatively unknown person can exercise an outsize, and detrimental, impact on election administration. In response to a request for comment, Bernegger did not address the claims raised in this article except to call them \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d and potentially defamatory. *** Bernegger became active in \u201celection integrity\u201d efforts in the wake of the 2020 election, developing an audience during the Wisconsin state legislature\u2019s investigation into allegations of election fraud. Led by the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d activist and former state supreme court justice Michael Gableman, Wisconsin\u2019s legislative inquiry into election malfeasance ultimately revealed no evidence of a plot. But it elevated the profiles of numerous election-doubting activists in the state, including Bernegger, a self-described \u201cinvestigative journalist\u201d who claimed to have discovered thousands of illegal votes cast during the 2020 election using a \u201csupercomputer\u201d and a team of vigilante researchers. In 2022, he went on to promote his claims in front of the state legislature, spending two hours describing his findings to the assembly committee on elections and campaigns. Now, in Wisconsin\u2019s sprawling community of election workers, Bernegger is known for sending barrages of requests for election-related records and suing when he is dissatisfied with the results. Since 2020, Bernegger, who is not an attorney, has represented himself in his many lawsuits against election clerks and offices, sometimes abandoning them before they are concluded. In at least two cases, Bernegger\u2019s complaints were dismissed on the grounds that he had simply stopped responding. In 2022, the Wisconsin elections commission voted to fine Bernegger a dollar for every claim of voter fraud the bipartisan group found to be frivolous in nature; his penalties amounted to $2,403. Election officials, especially those whose small offices are already strained, worry that speaking about Bernegger publicly will invite more litigation, tying up more crucial time and resources. \u201cI think the biggest thing is fear of retaliation \u2013 you know, and what\u2019s he going to do to make our lives more difficult, especially as we go into the 24 election cycle,\u201d said a Wisconsin clerk whose office Bernegger has sued, but who asked for anonymity, citing the concern that Bernegger would renew his legal efforts. \u201cIt\u2019s also just demoralizing to have somebody constantly attacking your integrity.\u201d In addition to filing public records requests, Bernegger has directly contacted clerks across the state with confusing and misleading emails. In an email sent on 25 October, 2022, for example, Bernegger claimed, incorrectly, that the state\u2019s electronic poll books, called Badger Books, required federal certification and that by using them, officials could be sued or face criminal charges. \u201cAny Clerk who uses Badger Books in any election, especially a federal one, will be breaking the law. This is directly on Meagan Wolfe,\u201d wrote Bernegger, referring to Wisconsin\u2019s top non-partisan election official who has become the focus of election-related conspiracy theories. \u201cShe put you, the Clerks, in this precarious legal position.\u201d Scott McDonell, the Dane county clerk, said municipal clerks across the county had reached out to him multiple times to flag Bernegger\u2019s misleading communications. In Dane county, where the state capital, Madison, is located, election conspiracy theories play a minimal role in local politics. As a result, McDonell is less politically vulnerable than officials in deep-red jurisdictions. He said he worries more about election clerks overseeing offices in smaller, less resourced municipalities in parts of the state where doubts about the results of the 2020 election have persisted. \u201cHe\u2019s causing them a lot of problems \u2013 in a lot of ways, more than me,\u201d said McDonell. In total, McDonell estimates that his office had spent more than 100 hours on Bernegger\u2019s inquiries and litigation. At least one of Wisconsin\u2019s more than 1,800 election clerks is receptive to Bernegger\u2019s claims. In response to an email from the Guardian inquiring about Bernegger\u2019s legal efforts, Donald Hayes, the clerk in Richmond \u2013 a town of just over 1,000 in southern Wisconsin \u2013 wrote that he believed that the \u201cright to freely elect our President was stolen from us during the last Presidential election\u201d and that Bernegger\u2019s efforts were an attempt \u201cto bring light to that tragedy\u201d. \u201cAs an election official, I discovered evidence from our very own election process, thanks to Mr Bernegger\u2019s inquiry, that confirmed my suspicions,\u201d wrote Hayes. Hayes did not respond to a question about the evidence Bernegger purportedly uncovered. At times, clerks said Bernegger\u2019s activism borders on harassment. In 2023, the Wisconsin state capitol police warned him that his conduct towards Wolfe, the chief administrator of the Wisconsin elections commission, could be interpreted as \u201cstalking\u201d. He is also known to name-check election workers on social media, where he enjoys a modest but enthusiastic following. In April, he posted the full names of two Dominion Voting Systems employees and insinuated, baselessly, that they were acting on behalf of the Chinese government. In an email to the Guardian, a spokesperson for Dominion called Bernegger\u2019s tweets identifying employees by first and last name \u201cyet another example of how lies about Dominion have damaged our company, subjected officials and Dominion employees to harassment, and baselessly diminished the public\u2019s faith in elections\u201d, adding that \u201callegations that Dominion employees anywhere tried to interfere with any election are completely false\u201d. *** Years before he began his relentless hunt for evidence of election interference, Bernegger focused on a very different venture: entrepreneurship and startups. According to court filings, Bernegger and an associate raised hundreds of thousands of dollars from investors to bankroll a collection of companies in the food processing business. Among other ventures Bernegger touted was a company called We-Gel, which he claimed was capable of harnessing waste from catfish processing plants to produce an alternative form of gelatin \u2013 one that could be used widely in pharmaceuticals. But there was a problem. The business partners \u201cwere never able to manufacture a sellable product\u201d, according to charges brought by the justice department in a 2008 case before a US district court in Mississippi. A jury convicted Bernegger of mail fraud and bank fraud for his participation in the scheme. Bernegger successfully appealed the initial amount of restitution down to $1.7m, from the approximately $2.2m initially ordered, but was unable to convince the courts to reduce his prison sentence of 70 months. It is not clear how Bernegger, whose grandparents founded the sausage and meat company Hillshire Farm, sustains his election-related efforts today. Bernegger is listed as the agent of two organizations registered in Wisconsin called Election Watch, Inc. and Wisconsin Center for Election Justice, Inc. In 2022, the latter group garnered $12,500 from an organization founded by the Trump ally and former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, according to the group\u2019s most recent tax filings. Amid his prosecution for allegedly doctoring a subpoena, Bernegger circulated a call for donations on a crowdfunding website. As of 25 April, he had received a smattering of small donations from individuals, amounting to just over $4,500 \u2013 far less than the fundraiser\u2019s stated goal of $45,000. Even as Bernegger\u2019s criminal proceedings wear on, which he describes as \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d, he continues to spread alarming and unsubstantiated claims about elections on the messaging app Telegram and on X, where he maintains 25,500 followers. Election officials worry he will ramp up his activism ahead of the 2024 general presidential election. In an 8 April post \u2013 six days after Wisconsin\u2019s 2024 presidential primary \u2013 Bernegger claimed that the clerk of Ozaukee county was unable to certify the election. \u201cDominion modems,\u201d he wrote, \u201cfailed to transmit.\u201d In the post, which was shared 1,600 times, Bernegger wrote that the clerk was \u201cpanicking\u201d and \u201cliberal Dem observers are going berserk\u201d. In fact, in Ozaukee county, which encompasses some of Milwaukee\u2019s northern suburbs, the election results were certified promptly \u2013 and Karen Niemuth, the Ozaukee county clerk, was far from panicked. \u201cI don\u2019t even have an increased heart rate,\u201d Niemuthsaid, \u201cbecause my canvass is complete, and it is certified, and there were no issues.\u201d"

            "content": "When Marisa Fern\u00e1ndez lost her husband to cancer a few years ago, her employers at the Eroski hypermarket went, she says, \u201cabove and beyond to help me through the dark days afterwards, rejigging my timetable and giving me time off when I couldn\u2019t face coming in.\u201d She had a chance to return the favour recently when the store, in Arrasate-Mondrag\u00f3n in Spain\u2019s Basque Country, was undergoing renovations. Fern\u00e1ndez, 58, who started on the cashier desk 34 years ago, and now manages the store\u2019s non-food section, volunteered to work extra shifts over the weekend along with her colleagues to ensure everything was ready for Monday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s not just me. Everyone is ready to go the extra mile,\u201d she says. Such harmonious employer-worker relations are the stuff of corporate dreams, and they are no accident here: the Eroski retail chain is part of Mondrag\u00f3n Corporation, the largest industrial co-op in the world. As a fully signed-up member, Fern\u00e1ndez co-owns part of the supermarket chain that also employs her. \u201cIt feels like mine,\u201d she says. \u201cWe work hard, but it\u2019s a totally different feeling from working for someone else.\u201d That sentiment is echoed by Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s 70,000 other workers. Made up of 81 autonomous co-operatives, the corporation has grown since its creation in 1956 to become a leading force in the Basque economy. Eroski is one of its most conspicuous manifestations, with 1,645 outlets across Spain. In addition to food, the chain has profitable sidelines in white goods, electronics, insurance and holiday bookings. More than its economic success, though, Mondrag\u00f3n has become a beacon for the co-operative model, as a more humane and egalitarian way of doing business that puts \u201cpeople over capital\u201d. Every worker has a stake in the company\u2019s fortunes and a say in how it is run, and receives a share of the profits. But the goal is more about creating \u201crich societies, not rich people\u201d. That means looking after workers during not only the good times but the tough times, too. The lowest point for Maite Aguirrebeitia, for example, came back in 2013, when, after 20 years\u2019 service, the Mondrag\u00f3n co-operative that she and her husband were affiliated to, Fagor Electrodom\u00e9sticos, filed for bankruptcy. Demand for its ovens and household appliances had plummeted after the 2008 financial crisis and despite help from a Mondrag\u00f3n \u201csolidarity fund\u201d, it never recovered. \u201cI felt this overwhelming sense of pain and grief at the time, as if someone close to me had died,\u201d the 56-year-old communications specialist recalls. \u201cPlus we had two kids and bills to pay and so on. The mental stress of it all was huge.\u201d Rather than thank the redundant workers for their service and wish them on their way, Mondrag\u00f3n committed to find alternative employment for as many of Fagor\u2019s 1,900 or so workers as it could. After temporary stints in five Mondrag\u00f3n co-operatives in 2022, Aguirrebeitia found a permanent placement with Mondragon Assembly, a manufacturer of equipment for process automation. Although it has meant a shift in career \u2013 she now works part-time in human resources, and part-time as a receptionist \u2013 the security of having a fixed job is a \u201chuge relief\u201d, she says. \u201cI always felt confident that somehow I\u2019d be looked after. I talked to other people who were out of work at the time and they had none of that. They were out on the street, totally alone. If I\u2019d had to compete in the open job market against all the youngsters coming out of university, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have ever found another job.\u201d Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s human-centric approach originated far from any business management school. Its roots lie in a socially engaged form of Catholicism that gained ground in the 1940s, during the early years of the Francoist regime. Its initial champion was a Basque-born cleric named Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arizmendiarrieta, who, in 1941, arrived in the small town of Arrasate-Mondrag\u00f3n, about 30 miles (50km) south-east of Bilbao. Taking it as his pastoral mission to revitalise the local economy, the diocesan priest set up a technical school for young men. A few years later, he arranged for some of them to take distance-learning degrees in industrial engineering. \u201cAfter graduating, they all found jobs in conventional companies in the town, but they felt stifled \u2026 they wanted more of a say over their destiny, but their employers thought otherwise,\u201d explains Ander Etxeberria, head of Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s outreach programme. With Arizmendiarrieta\u2019s encouragement, five of these first 11 graduates decided in 1955 to set up the now defunct Fagor Electrodom\u00e9sticos. Seeking a model that reflected their Christian socialist philosophy, they turned to the Rochdale Pioneers, a group of tradespeople from the Lancashire town who, more than a century before, had established the world\u2019s first co-operative. That venture grew to become today\u2019s Co-operative Group, home to the UK\u2019s fifth biggest food retailer and its largest provider of funeral services. Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s founders adopted wholesale many of the Pioneers\u2019 core tenets. In their modern-day headquarters, located in a renovated 14th-century tower with a spectacular mountain backdrop, Etxeberria counts off the group\u2019s 10 \u201cbasic principles\u201d. The list ranges from the sovereignty of labour and democratic organisation (one member, one vote), to wage solidarity and \u201csocial transformation\u201d \u2013 which includes reinvesting surpluses to create new jobs, supporting local charities and community development projects, and strengthening the Basque Country\u2019s Euskara language. Top of the list is voluntary and open membership \u2013 namely, the opportunity for everyone to have a personal stake in the enterprise where they work. As an early version of the principles reads: \u201cThe first form of elemental justice that we need to practise is to consider each other as free human beings.\u201d These values hold true into the present, Etxeberria explains. The salary differential between the highest and lowest paid workers in Mondrag\u00f3n, for example, remains about six to one; for the largest 500 listed companies in the US, the gap is closer to 272 to one. At the year end, members of Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s co-operatives also decide collectively on whether they should pay themselves bonuses and, if so, how much. This profit-sharing comes in addition to a base pay rate that, on average, is 40% above Spain\u2019s minimum wage. Despite its social responsibility credentials, Mondrag\u00f3n remains a competitive business. When Etxeberria presses \u201cplay\u201d on an introductory video, the screen shows not pictures of happy workers doing yoga but gleaming industrial facilities and straight-faced technicians in lab coats. Overlaying these images are facts and figures that would have mainstream financiers salivating: \u20ac10.6bn (\u00a39.1bn) in annual revenues; a dozen research and development facilities; a global roster of blue-chip clients; and a diversified sector spread \u2013 industry, retail, finance and education. The same no-nonsense, professional vibe is on show at Fagor Arrasate, a Mondrag\u00f3n affiliate located on one of the many industrial estates that ring Arrasate-Mondrag\u00f3n, a vibrant town of cafe-strewn streets and busy bars. A specialist in metal presses and stamping systems, Fagor Arrasate boasts several hangar-sized workshops full of robotic machinery and giant components ready for export. \u201cSome of the installations we make for customers can be three to four storeys high, so these are massive, multimillion-euro investments,\u201d enthuses Edorta Mendieta, the venture\u2019s marketing manager. Pinned to a cork noticeboard beside a busy production line are photos of a recent charity run, a printout of donations to local causes (including \u20ac60,000 for a nearby organic food association), and a poster about a forthcoming \u201cwomen in science\u201d event. In the centre of the board, an A4 sheet of closely printed text gives notice of the co-operative\u2019s general assembly, where next year\u2019s strategy plan will be put to an all-member vote. Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s collective spirit also offers an edge with innovation. In a process that the movement refers to as \u201cinter-cooperation\u201d, co-operatives within the group frequently swap ideas between themselves and engage in joint research. Over the years, many of the best innovations have come from alliances with Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s homegrown university. Located on a leafy campus in Arrasate-Mondrag\u00f3n, the university was set up with a strong practical bent to both its teaching and its research. So much so, in fact, that the European Commission recently selected it to co-lead a major \u201cdual training\u201d programme aimed at blending academia with business to tackle global challenges such as the climate crisis. Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s approach has proved itself profitable and resilient, so could it become a realistic alternative to the modern corporation? It\u2019s a moot point. Despite their worker-first philosophy, the movement\u2019s leaders are reluctant to denounce the wealth-maximising nature of modern market capitalism. The reason is as simple as it is awkward: Mondrag\u00f3n must actively participate in that same capitalist system for its survival. This tactic of being \u201cin, but not of\u201d the world of mainstream business has seen the Basque-based movement face charges of double standards. In particular, critics highlight its outsourcing of some of its production to low-wage countries with weaker labour standards, such as China and Mexico. Mondrag\u00f3n argues that it has checks and balances in place to ensure that its foreign business partners uphold workers\u2019 rights, and that keeping costs low is part and parcel of staying competitive. \u201cFor us, workers will always come before capital. But capital is still important because without it we cannot fulfil our mission of social transformation,\u201d says Javier Marcos, Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s director of communications. Radical as that mission is, its focus is and always has been primarily on el territorio (the local Basque region); less about rewriting the global economic order and more about improving co-op members\u2019 lives. That said, if others want to copy the Mondrag\u00f3n model, then its doors are always open, insists Etxeberria. In the past month alone, he has hosted large groups of policymakers and business students from the Philippines, Brazil and the US. \u201cThey come to see if our approach works in practice,\u201d he says. \u201cThey all go back pleasantly surprised, I think.\u201d Young people, in particular, are attracted to the notion of business and entrepreneurship going beyond just the pursuit of profit, but they \u201cdon\u2019t know the co-operative possibility exists,\u201d says Ana Aguirre, a graduate of Mondrag\u00f3n University. The 33-year-old now co-runs Tazebaez, a worker-owned consultancy and education provider that she and eight fellow students created during their bachelor\u2019s degree. For the few who have heard of co-operativism, she adds, most relegate it in the folksy, do-gooder box. \u201cThe problem is that it\u2019s portrayed as something to do with charity or [philanthropic] foundations, rather than as a credible business model.\u201d Pursuing a co-operative model is far from plain sailing, however. Numerous hurdles exist. For one, membership does not come cheap. To join a co-operative, workers typically put up a one-off payment of about \u20ac17,000 each. Plus, just as they are entitled to a share of any profits, so, too, are they liable for any losses. Commercial pressures can also prove acute, as Fagor Electrodom\u00e9sticos\u2019s troubled history shows. The fact that all major investment decisions have to be put to the vote can also make Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s co-operatives less agile than their conventional competitors. And finding financing can be problematic as the private capital markets are effectively closed to them, admits Fagor Arrasate\u2019s Mendieta: \u201cWe can\u2019t incorporate external capital into the co-operative\u2019s share capital because we are governed by the principle of \u2018one person, one vote\u2019, which no capitalist investor would accept.\u201d In some parts of the world, Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s approach just looks downright weird. No one bats an eyelid at the co-operative model in countries such as Germany, \u201cbut with these ideas in Texas or Kansas, you\u2019re basically a communist,\u201d says Mendieta, only half jokingly. Across Europe, at least, the co-operative model is widespread. In Norway, for instance, co-ops have a strong heritage in the social housing sector. Italy\u2019s Emilia-Romagna region boasts a long tradition of industrial co-operatives similar to that of the Basque Country. And, as well as the Co-operative Group, the UK\u2019s almost 7,000 co-operatives include the mighty John Lewis Partnership, which has a turnover of nearly \u00a310bn. In total, the EU hosts about 250,000 co-operatives, providing 5.4m jobs. Increasingly, the movement\u2019s footprint is also being seen in company law. Germany has long required corporate boards to have worker representatives, for instance. Similarly, Spanish law allows unemployed people to lump together their unemployment benefit to set up small businesses \u2013 known as Sociedades Laborales \u2013 as long as they are majority owned by their employees. The rise in mainstream corporations now talking the language of employee autonomy, horizontal management, dignified wages and similar themes suggests co-operativism is leaving its mark on business company practices if not \u2013 yet \u2013 on capitalist ownership Back in Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s fort-like headquarters, Etxeberria is quietly confident about the movement\u2019s prospects. Co-operativism, he says, is a little like zirimiri \u2013 the Eusakara word for \u201cdrizzle\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s the same ideas that keep falling; they\u2019ll settle eventually.\u201d"

            "content": "America\u2019s leading stock indices came under pressure on Thursday after official data revealed that US economic growth slowed sharply to its weakest rate in almost two years. But as high interest rates take their toll on the world\u2019s largest economy, inflation continues to loom large. The Dow Jones industrial average fell by as much as 1.8% in New York before recovering to close down 1%. The S&amp;P 500 also dropped by as much as 1.5%, before finishing down 0.5%. The technology-focused Nasdaq declined 1.9%, before clawing back some of its losses to close down 0.6%. Gross domestic product increased at an annualized rate of 1.6% in the first quarter, significantly short of the 2.4% rate expected by economists. But a closely watched measure of inflation also rose faster than anticipated, raising questions about the Federal Reserve\u2019s next steps in its fight to bring down price growth. The so-called \u201ccore\u201d personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index \u2013 which strips out volatile food and energy costs \u2013 rose 3.7% in the first three months of the year, according to a report published by the commerce department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis. The same measure rose by 2% in the last quarter of 2023. While economists had expected an acceleration, the reading was higher than the average 3.4% forecast. Inflation has been easing in the US, with unemployment remaining low and growth largely resilient, raising hopes that the Fed will guide the world\u2019s largest economy to a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d, where price growth normalizes and recession is avoided. But Thursday\u2019s data on the first quarter \u2013 with growth fading, and inflation on the rise \u2013 will test this confidence. \u201cQ1\u2019s sluggish increase in GDP likely sets the tone for the rest of 2024,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, predicting that core PCE inflation \u201cwill rise at an annualized rate much closer to 2%\u201d over the next few months. The first quarter\u2019s core inflation reading could \u201cspook the Fed a little\u201d, said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. \u201cThe core PCE deflator rose 3.7% at an annualized rate in Q1, nearly double the clip seen in each of the prior two quarters and stronger than either we or the consensus anticipated.\u201d While inflation has slowed dramatically since peaking at its highest level in a generation two summers ago, prices still remain far higher than where they stood before the pandemic. The economy is at the heart of this year\u2019s presidential election campaign, as voters mull whether they felt better off under Joe Biden, or the Trump administration. \u201cThe landing is, and will be, soft,\u201d Biden declared during his State of the Union address last month. \u201cIt takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it. Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring.\u201d But Donald Trump, who is fighting to regain the presidency in November, has claimed inflation is \u201ckilling America\u201d under Biden. On Thursday Janet Yellen, Biden\u2019s treasury secretary, told Reuters that the US economy \u201ccontinues to perform very, very well\u201d, describing the latest growth as \u201cpeculiar, but not concerning\u201d.

            "date": "2024-04-25T18:00:16Z",
            "content": "Noise pollution from traffic stunts growth in baby birds, even while inside the egg, research has found. Unhatched birds and hatchlings that are exposed to noise from city traffic experience long-term negative effects on their health, growth and reproduction, the study found. \u201cSound has a much stronger and more direct impact on bird development than we knew before,\u201d said Dr Mylene Mariette, a bird communication expert at Deakin University in Australia and a co-author of the study, published in the journal Science. \u201cIt would be wise to work more to reduce noise pollution.\u201d A growing body of research has suggested that noise pollution causes stress to birds and makes communication harder for them. But whether birds are already distressed at a young age because they are affected by noise, or by how noise disrupts their environment and parental care, was still unclear. Mariette\u2019s team routinely exposed zebra finch eggs for five days to either silence, soothing playbacks of zebra finch songs, or recordings of city traffic noises such as revving motors and cars driving past. They did the same with newborn chicks for about four hours a night for up to 13 nights, without exposing the birds\u2019 parents to the sounds. They noticed that the bird eggs were almost 20% less likely to hatch if exposed to traffic noise. The chicks that did hatch were more than 10% smaller and almost 15% lighter than the other hatchlings. When the team ran analyses on their red blood cells and their telomeres \u2013 a piece of DNA that shortens with stress and age \u2013 they were more eroded and shorter than their counterparts\u2019. The effects continued even after the chicks were no longer exposed to noise pollution, and carried over into their reproductive age four years later. The birds disturbed by noise during the early stages of their lives produced fewer than half as many offspring as their counterparts. \u201cWe were expecting some effects, but we didn\u2019t expect them to be so strong,\u201d said Mariette, especially because the exposure to noise pollution was relatively mild and for only four hours a day. \u201cIt was really quite striking.\u201d \u201cWe generally assume, based on numerous studies, that very young birds, especially in the egg, have very poor or no sensitivity to sound,\u201d said Robert Dooling, an animal hearing expert from the University of Maryland in the US, who was not involved in the study. But \u201cthis study raises the spectre of broad, negative, enduring effects of noise on development\u201d. Hans Slabbekoorn, a professor of acoustic ecology and behaviour at Leiden University in the Netherlands who was not involved in the study, said he was particularly surprised. When his team ran experiments exposing chicks and their parents to moderate noise pollution, they did not find any impact on the growth of the chicks. Slabbekoorn speculated that changes in the behaviour of the parents \u2013 such as how they attended to their nests more \u2013 may have avoided or compensated for the negative effects of noise on the chicks. \u201cI was indeed not expecting [such a] big impact necessarily,\u201d Slabbekoorn said. It is the cumulative nature of these negative effects that may \u201cin the end be most problematic\u201d, he added. \u201cEspecially when noisy conditions are indeed frequent or continuous, as with birds living in noisy neighbourhoods, close to airports, or busy highways.\u201d His research has also found that birds at airports are exposed to such loud noise levels that they may be partially deaf. More data is needed to pinpoint how many birds and which species these levels apply to, and it remains unclear whether it is the loudness, the pattern, the pitch, or other elements of traffic noise that disturb the young birds, or the mechanism behind the observed effects."

            "date": "2024-04-18T16:10:35Z",
            "content": "Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine is stoking geopolitical tensions and damaging the recovery prospects of the global economy, the head of the International Monetary Fund has warned. Kristalina Georgieva urged an end to the two-year conflict, saying it was both a human tragedy and a barrier to growth. As G7 finance ministers said they were looking at ways of using the almost $300bn (\u00a3240bn) of seized Russian assets to help Ukraine, the IMF managing director said support for Kyiv remained \u201csteady and firm\u201d. Georgieva said Ukraine would need $42bn of financial support this year. The G7 group of leading developed countries said it would \u201ccontinue working on all possible avenues by which immobilised Russian sovereign assets could be made use of to support Ukraine, consistent with international law and our respective legal systems\u201d. The communique released after the meeting in Washington also hinted at tougher sanctions against Iran following last weekend\u2019s missile and drone attack on Israel. \u201cWe will ensure close coordination of any future measure to diminish Iran\u2019s ability to acquire, produce, or transfer weapons to support its destabilising regional activities,\u201d the G7 said. Most of the seized Russian assets are being held in Europe, and the European Central Bank is concerned that outright seizure would result in tit-for-tat retaliation from Moscow and may contravene international law. One idea being pursued is to pull forward the interest payments on frozen Russian assets \u2013 estimated at between \u20ac3bn to \u20ac5bn (\u00a32.6bn to \u00a34.3bn) a year \u2013 so that they can be used as collateral for loans or bonds to support Ukraine. The UK chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the G7 had reluctantly concluded that the war in Ukraine was not going to end any time soon and would require a longer term commitment. Georgieva said the sooner the conflicts in Ukraine and in Gaza ended the better it would be for the global economy. \u201cThe war in Ukraine is a tragedy for its people. Having men, women and children killed and wounded is a daily occurrence. We need to end this war for their sake and for the sake of the world economy,\u201d she said. Six months of fighting between Israel and Hamas had meant Gaza\u2019s economy had been \u201cwiped out\u201d, Georgieva said. \u201cEighty per cent of it is gone. The West Bank has also been impacted.\u201d Speaking at a press conference at the IMF\u2019s spring meeting, Georgieva said: \u201cThe world has grappled with multiple shocks \u2013 the pandemic, a cost of living crisis, war and conflict, and climate disasters. The twenties has already been a turbulent decade.\u201d Countries had acted to mitigate the impact of the shocks of the past four years, but it was now time to rebuild buffers, the IMF chief said. \u201cFiscal restraint is becoming more important. Countries must rebuild their fiscal resilience to be ready for the next shock.\u201d The IMF\u2019s world economic outlook released this week showed the US economy was on course to grow more than three times as rapidly as the eurozone this year \u2013 2.7% increase in gross domestic product against 0.8%. Georgieva said there were three factors that explained the disparity. First, the US was better at harnessing innovation so that new ideas could be turned into successful businesses. There was still \u201cwork to be done\u201d to unleash innovation in Europe, Georgieva said, citing the costs of patents in Europe compared with in the US. Second, migration. While the record number of people coming into the US across its southern borders has become a big political issue, Georgieva said its economy was benefitting from \u201cabundant\u201d labour coming into the country. \u201cIt creates a domestic political problem, and not everyone who crosses the border adds positively to the economy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that labour supply also gives to the US another comparative advantage; wages are not pushing up, because there is no strong pressure because of a lack of labour on wage growth.\u201d Third, was that the US had benefitted from more favourable energy prices than Europe, where natural gas prices soared after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Georgieva said."

            "title": "UK rent rises forecast to outpace wage growth for three years",
            "date": "2024-04-07T23:01:17Z",
            "content": "Rent rises in Britain are forecast to outpace wage growth, despite having already surged at the fastest pace on record after the Covid pandemic and the cost of living crisis. The Resolution Foundation expects added pressure on millions of households and said average rents could increase by 13% over the next three years as current high growth in the private rental market work their way through existing tenancies. Forecasting 4.2% growth in average rents in each year up to 2027, the thinktank said this rate was much faster than the 7.5% growth in average workers\u2019 earnings (2.4% a year on average) predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility over that period. Rishi Sunak\u2019s government last month watered down reforms to increase protections for renters against no-fault evictions, leading to accusations that the prime minister and the housing secretary, Michael Gove, had caved in to Tory MPs lobbying in favour of landlords\u2019 interests. In a report titled Through the Roof, the Resolution Foundation said renters across the country had already been through an exceptional surge in new tenancy rent levels \u2013 up by almost a fifth over the past two years. It said the surge had affected more households in the past after a big increase in private renting, almost doubling from 11% of all households in the mid-1990s to 20%. This included a sharp increase in the number of families living in private rented accommodation headed by someone aged 30-49, meaning that renting was no longer solely the preserve of those in their 20s. However, the report said record growth in rental costs was beginning to slow after a \u201cbounceback from the pandemic\u201d, with market rents for new tenancies having cooled from an annual growth rate in cost of 10.4% in June 2023 to 7.5% by March 2024. But the thinktank warned that it could still take years for this burst of growth to work through the whole private rental sector. While new renters were already paying higher monthly outgoings, it said existing tenants reaching the end of their tenancies, or those being forced to accept within-tenancy price rises, would face large rent increases in future. The report found that the main factor driving up rental costs was the snapback from Covid lockdowns, when evictions and repossessions were halted and rents collapsed amid heightened economic uncertainty. More recently, it said fast-rising wages had also pushed up rents for new tenancies. It said there had been \u201cscare stories\u201d about higher interest rate rises and tougher regulations, causing a mass exodus of landlords from the private rental sector. However, it dismissed this as having only a limited impact, highlighting Bank of England research showing the sector had only shrank by 1% since mid-2019. The thinktank said rents tended to track wage levels over the longer term but had fallen to the lowest level on record relative to earnings amid the disruption of the pandemic. While they had risen back by early 2022, they still remained about 5% lower, indicating that they would continue to increase by 13% over the next three years to return the UK\u2019s rent-to-earnings ratio to its long-term trend. Cara Pacitti, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cWith more families renting privately, and renting for longer too, these rent surges are a bigger problem for Britain, and require bolder solutions from policymakers. \u201cShort-term solutions include regular uprating of local housing allowance to support poorer families, and the ultimate, longer-term solution is to simply build more homes.\u201d A government spokesperson said it was supporting households with help for bills amid the cost of living crisis. \u201cOur Renters (Reform) Bill will give people more security in their homes and empower them to challenge poor practices. Through our long term plan for housing we are investing \u00a311.5bn in the affordable homes programme and remain on track to build one million over this parliament.\u201d"

            "content": "The Guardian is right to identify the global sovereign debt crisis as one of the most critical impediments to sustainable development today (Editorial,16 April). Debt relief is urgently needed, but we must also learn the lessons of history. The historic Jubilee 2000 debt relief campaign saw $130bn of debt written off, and yet we now find ourselves in a renewed global debt crisis. This time, action must address the cyclical nature of debt crises. That countries such as Ghana and Sri Lanka are accepting their 17th IMF bailout packages since independence is a stark illustration of how ineffective existing strategies are at breaking the cycle. Bailout packages often come with harsh stipulations, such as budget cuts, that stifle development, worsen living conditions, and leave economies vulnerable to future debt crises. While the IMF chief, Kristalina Georgieva, noted the urgency of debt action ahead of the Spring Meetings, she continued to prescribe budget cuts as a tool to stabilise debt, despite evidence that spending decreases have little effect on debt reduction. In contrast, legislative reform and democratising global financial institutions offer long-term solutions. Legislation to prevent private creditors from suing debtor countries for more than they would receive if they took part in debt-relief initiatives on equal terms to other lenders would provide immediate relief for countries in crisis and prevent future crises by disincentivising risky lending. The creation of a permanent, representative and transparent global debt workout mechanism within the UN system, and an end to harmful conditionalities on loans that exacerbate poverty, harm the environment and stunt growth, would also transform the global debt architecture. It\u2019s time to break free from the redundant cycle of debt and dependency that hinders so many nations.

            "content": "Australia\u2019s inflation rate slowed less than expected in the March quarter as rents and education costs increased, dimming hopes the cost-of-living crunch was easing and lessening chances of a 2024 cut in official interest rates. The consumer price index for the first three months of 2024 was 3.6% higher than a year earlier, slowing from the 4.1% annual pace in the December quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. Economists had tipped CPI growth would drop to 3.5%. The March quarterly inflation rate was 1%, compared with the 0.6% pace in the December quarter. Economists had tipped it would rise to 0.8%. \u201cHaving sprinted lower in the back end of 2023, headline inflation is struggling to keep that momentum going,\u201d Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist with Moody\u2019s Analytics, said. For March alone, CPI was 3.5%, up from the 3.4% pace recorded for January and February. \u201cService inflation is the main culprit holding back progress,\u201d he said. \u201cInflation will keep easing from here but progress will be slow.\u201d Education costs in the quarter rose 5.9%, led by a 6.5% jump for tertiary expenses. Health costs were also up 2.8% for the three months. Rents advanced 2.1%, lifting the annual increase to 7.8%, or the fastest pace in 15 years amid very low vacancy rates, the ABS said. Perth alone saw rents jump 9.9% from a year ago, ahead of Sydney\u2019s 8.9% increase and 6.8% in Melbourne \u2013 though Hobart\u2019s rents eased 0.4%. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Electricity prices were among those turning lower. They fell 1.7% in the March quarter, reversing a 1.4% rise in the previous three months. From a year earlier, they were 2% higher. Without government rebates, the annual rise would have been 17%. The country\u2019s inflation rate has been falling since it hit a peak at the end of 2022, driven lower in part by the sharpest increase in official interest rates in three decades. Other nations, such as the US and UK, had lately seen inflation either start to rebound or slow less than expected, fostering concerns about the challenges of the so-called last mile of squeezing excessive demand out of the economy. On the other hand, China \u2013 easily Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner \u2013 has been flirting with deflation, a trend that would tend to ease inflation globally. The Reserve Bank\u2019s board will analyse the latest data closely when it meets on 6-7 May. Prior to today\u2019s data release, investors were rating only a sliver of a chance of an RBA rate cut next month, with markets fully pricing in a 25-basis point reduction in the cash rate by February 2025. The federal budget, to be released on 14 May, will also be shaped by the inflation figures. The Albanese government will likely argue its spending won\u2019t stoke inflation pressure and delay any interest rate cut by the central bank. After the ABS released the figures, financial markets trimmed their bets that an early interest rate was in the offing. The Australian dollar leapt more than a quarter of a US cent to trade at about 65.25 US cents, while the ASX200 share index erased its gains of about 0.4% for the day. Aside from the headline CPI, the RBA also looks at the trimmed mean and weighted median measures that strip out some of the volatile movers. Both had been expected to increase 0.9% for the quarter, but instead rose 1% and 1.1%, respectively. At an annual rate, the trimmed mean eased to 4% from 4.2% in the December quarter, while the weighted median was steady at 4.4%. Goods and services deemed by the ABS to be \u201cnon-discretionary\u201d rose 4.2% from a year earlier, while \u201cdiscretionary\u201d ones rose 2.9%. Two categories that were helpful in easing inflation may not be so beneficial in coming months. Automotive fuel fell 1% in the quarter, with the average unleaded petrol price dropping 2 cents to $1.94 per litre. Middle East tensions since the end of March have pushed petrol prices back above $2 in much of the country. Food and non-alcoholic beverages were 3.8% higher than a year ago, or roughly in line with the overall CPI result. \u201cMeat and seafood prices fell this quarter as increased supply and discounting led to price drops for beef and veal and lamb and goat,\u201d Michelle Marquardt, ABS head of prices statistics, said. \u201cDiscounting of fish and other seafood and other meats also contributed to the fall.\u201d Farmers were busy de-stocking six months ago after the driest three months ever recorded by the Bureau of Meteorology, and as an El Ni\u00f1os event was unfolding. That feat is not likely to be repeated soon."

The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks listed in London ended trading on Monday above its previous closing peak, set in February 2023, helped by rate cut hopes and a weakening pound. The index closed at 8,023 points, having jumped by 128 points, or 1.6%, on Monday. Its previous closing high was 8,014 points. This left the index shy of its all-time intraday high, also set in February 2023, when the index hit 8,047.06 points. Investor spirits in London were lifted by expectations that the Bank of England will lower interest rates by half a percentage point this year, down to 4.75% by December from the current 16-year high of 5.25%. The City money markets brought forward the likely timing of the first rate cut to August, from September, after the Bank\u2019s deputy governor, Sir Dave Ramsden, predicted on Friday that UK inflation could be lower than expected over the next three years, and remain close to the Bank\u2019s 2% target. The headline rate of inflation is now 3.2%. The pound weakened to $1.23 against the US dollar on Monday, the lowest since November. A weaker pound has supported share prices in London this year, as the lower currency makes the overseas earnings of multinational companies more valuable in sterling terms. Easing tensions in the Middle East also lifted investors\u2019 confidence, after a weekend without further attacks between Iran and Israel after the Israeli missile attack on the Iranian cities of Isfahan and Tabriz on Friday. \u201cThe FTSE 100 bounced back strongly on Monday amid relief that tensions in the Middle East seem to have been contained for now,\u201d said Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell. \u201cTravel and retail stocks were among the gainers on the FTSE 100, with precious metals miner Fresnillo the only stock showing notable weakness, with gold and silver prices dipping as demand for safe havens eased.\u201d Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the FTSE 100 had \u201ca spring in its step\u201d at the start of the week amid an easing of geopolitical tensions. \u201cLondon\u2019s blue-chip index has had a surge of power as heightened geopolitical tensions have eased, and investors assessed the brighter prospects for the UK economy, with interest rate cuts spied on the horizon,\u201d Streeter said. \u201cThe pulse of positivity comes in the absence of fresh retaliatory attacks by Israel or Iran and the US flexing its funding muscle and passing a crucial aid package for Ukraine.\u201d The FTSE 100 index has gained almost 4% so far this year amid optimism that Britain\u2019s economy has returned to growth in 2024 after dropping into a shallow recession at the end of 2023. That leaves it lagging behind other European indices, with France\u2019s Cac and Germany\u2019s Dax up 6.5% so far this year."

            "date": "2024-04-10T13:07:26Z",
            "content": "Global financial markets have scaled back expectations for an imminent cut in interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic after figures showed US inflation rose by more than expected in March. Figures from the US Department of Labor show a jump in fuel and housing rental costs drove up the consumer price index (CPI) to 3.5% in March compared with a year earlier, higher than expected by Wall Street economists. In a development triggering a sell-off in financial markets, monthly inflation and core CPI \u2013 which removes volatile items including energy and food \u2013 also rose by more than predicted. US government bond yields rose sharply, while shares fell in New York amid speculation that stubborn inflationary pressures could force the US Federal Reserve to delay cutting interest rates. \u201cExpectations for a June Federal Reserve interest rate cut have collapsed,\u201d said James Knightley, chief international economist at the Dutch bank ING. \u201cJuly is also doubtful, meaning September is the more probable start point of any easing, which would limit the Fed to a maximum of just three rate cuts this year.\u201d The figures also led traders to slash bets for the Bank of England to cut borrowing costs in June, amid concerns that inflation in the US and the UK could persist at higher levels than previously thought. Financial markets are now pricing a 54% chance of the UK central bank keeping interest rates unchanged in June, having previously reflected a greater probability of a cut before the US inflation figures were released. Inflation in the world\u2019s largest economy has fallen sharply from a high of over 9% in 2022 but has remained stubbornly above the Fed\u2019s target rate of 2%. Inflation in the UK has fallen from over 10% last year to 3.4% in February. Figures for March are due to be published next week. The latest figures from the US show March\u2019s increase was driven by rising costs for shelter and gasoline. \u201cCombined, these two indexes contributed over half of the monthly increase in the index,\u201d the labor department said. Gasoline rose 1.7% from the previous month and is 1.3% higher than the same time last year. Shelter is 5.7% higher than a year ago and rose 0.4% over the month. Ryan Stewart, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, pointed out that gasoline prices typically rise this time of year. \u201cBut it still has economic costs as every $0.01 rise in retail gasoline prices reduces consumer spending between $1bn and $1.5bn over the course of a year,\u201d he wrote in a note to investors. The Fed increased its benchmark interest rate from near zero to over 5% over the last 16 months in a bid to cool inflation. Recently the central bank has held off on further rate rises and economists had expected rate cuts later this year. Those hopes have faded in recent weeks amid signs that inflation has remained sticky. The US central bank has a twin mandate \u2013 to keep prices under control and achieve maximum employment. The jobs market has remained robust despite the Fed\u2019s attempts to cool the economy, adding 303,000 positions last month. The inflation news will further complicate November\u2019s US elections, as Joe Biden attempts to point to progress in the American economy. Nearly 15.2m jobs have been created since he took office and unemployment has remained below 4% for the longest stretch in 50 years. Meanwhile stock markets have hit record highs and inflation \u2013 while above the Fed\u2019s target \u2013 has fallen sharply. But polling shows that voters are unhappy with the president\u2019s economic stewardship, inflation and high interest rates. Some economists are now predicting that the Fed may not begin cutting rates until after the election. In a statement, Biden said: \u201cToday\u2019s report shows inflation has fallen more than 60% from its peak, but we have more to do to lower costs for hardworking families. Prices are still too high for housing and groceries, even as prices for key household items like milk and eggs are lower than a year ago.\u201d Biden called on corporations to use their \u201crecord profits to reduce prices\u201d and attacked Republicans who he said \u201cwant to slash taxes for billionaires and big corporations, while helping special interests and big pharma raise prices\u201d. On his social media site Truth Social, Biden\u2019s presidential rival Donald Trump wrote: \u201cINFLATION is BACK\u2014and RAGING! The Fed will never be able to credibly lower interest rates, because they want to protect the worst President in the history of the Untied [sic] States!\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-17T09:59:54Z",
            "content": "When the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, told an event in Washington on Tuesday that the UK economy was \u201cdisinflating\u201d, it raised the hopes of mortgage payers and indebted businesses that a cut in the cost of borrowing could be on the way soon. But less than 24 hours later, the latest UK inflation data and worsening interest rate forecasts have curtailed those aspirations. The figures from the Office for National Statistics released on Wednesday showed a fall in the consumer prices index to 3.2% in March, worse than the expected 3.1%. Meanwhile, City investors, who previously had run ahead of Bailey\u2019s signalling to bet on four or even five interest rate cuts this year, now consider the governor\u2019s talk of the disinflation process \u201cworking its way through\u201d to be overoptimistic. Last week, investors were putting their money on the Bank\u2019s first interest rate cut taking effect in August, with many also predicting an earlier date. Now the expectation is increasingly skewed towards a first cut in September or even November. A half-point cut by the end of the year is priced into financial markets, when only a few months ago the expectation was that there would be a 1.25 percentage point cut. Currency dealers agree that a later date is more likely. Across the Atlantic there has been speculation that the Federal Reserve will delay its first cuts in the cost of borrowing after a rebound in US inflation to 3.5% last week. This would make the UK the first of the two central banks to cut, an expectation that pushed down the pound from $1.27 to 1.24 against the dollar. In the wake of Wednesday\u2019s UK inflation figures the pound has begun to recover. The prospect of a first cut as late as November plays badly for Rishi Sunak, who is widely expected to delay a general election to the autumn in order to benefit from an improving economy. An essential element of any improvement would be the prospect of reduced interest rates. The Conservatives calculate that lower borrowing costs will bring back into the Tory fold many of the mortgage-paying millennials who have deserted them in recent years. To maintain any chance of this happening before the election, Sunak could pick a December or even January date. Yet even such a delay may not be enough. Bailey hedged his bets in his speech to the International Monetary Fund event in Washington by saying the global situation remained volatile and the prospect of renewed disruption to shipping could increase prices again. The governor has come under fire more than once for describing the last two years of inflation as transitory, given the UK is considered to be the most open economy in the developed world and therefore the most likely to catch an economic cold when the world sneezes. The coronavirus pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine spelled disaster for a country dependent on imported energy and food. In essence, Bailey was, and remains, correct. Fuel and energy prices were bound to settle, and when they did, the inflation cycle would be over. He might say he was only wrong about the length of the transition, blaming it on the war in Ukraine, which he failed to foresee, like many others. However, March\u2019s inflation figures show that core inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, declined only to 4.2% in March from 4.5% the previous month. Analysts had expected a decline to 4.1%. Services inflation, which is closely monitored by the Bank as an indicator of domestic price pressure, fell even less and remains high at 6%, down on 6.1% in February. It is these figures that are influencing the financial markets. They fear the UK has failed to tackle the essential building blocks of inflation. If that is true, interest rates will remain high well into 2025."

            "content": "The UK stock market hit a record high on Tuesday, as shares were lifted by hopes of interest rate cuts and an easing of geopolitical tensions. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks listed in London hit 8,076 points on Tuesday, surpassing a previous high of 8,047 in February 2023. On Monday, it ended at a record closing high of 8,023 points. The FTSE hit its new peak as City investors anticipated two cuts to UK interest rates this year, with the first now fully priced in for August. Last Friday, the Bank of England deputy governor, Sir Dave Ramsden, predicted that UK inflation could be lower than expected over the next three years, and remain close to the Bank\u2019s 2% target. The headline rate of inflation is now 3.2%. the prediction weakened the pound, which fell to its lowest since November this week at about $1.2340, pushing up share prices of multinational companies whose dollar earnings are more valuable in sterling terms. But the FTSE 100 fell back from its intraday high, after Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill indicated on Tuesday that he believed rate cuts were still some way off. The FTSE 100 ended Tuesday at a new record closing high, for the second day running, at 8044 points. Investor confidence has also risen this month, particularly in the UK market, according to the financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cThe UK market is currently on a considerable discount to developed market peers of about 40%, but features high-quality companies with global revenues, good cash reserves, and in many cases well-covered, attractive dividends,\u201d said Emma Wall, the head of investment analysis and research at Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cThe economic picture is not as rosy as in the US, but there is a potential benefit to this if you\u2019re a shareholder, it means that the Bank of England is likely to cut interest rates sooner than the Fed across the Pond.\u201d The top FTSE risers on Tuesday were Primark owner Associated British Foods, up by 9%, JD Sports, up by 6% and Ocado, up by 5%. Sentiment was also bolstered by the lack of any further escalation in the Middle East in recent days, after Israel\u2019s attack on the Iranian city of Isfahan on Friday. \u201cIndeed, yesterday saw Iran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson say that Israel had received the \u201cnecessary response at this stage\u201d,\u201d Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said. The FTSE 100 index has gained about 4% so far this year amid optimism that Britain\u2019s economy has returned to growth in 2024 after dropping into a shallow recession at the end of 2023. That leaves it lagging behind other European indices, with France\u2019s Cac and Germany\u2019s Dax up 6.5% so far this year. The engineering company Rolls-Royce has been the top riser on the FTSE 100 so far this year. Its shares are up by 37%, as profits have surged as it recovered from the pandemic. The Chilean miner Antofagasta has gained 28%, lifted by a rise in the copper price this year. Banks have had a good 2024, with NatWest up by 29% since the start of January and Barclays 25% higher. Defence stocks have risen amid the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and BAE Systems is up by 20% this year (on top of a 30% jump in 2023). The FTSE 100 was launched on 3 January 1984, when it was priced at 1,000 points. It quickly elbowed aside the FT 30 index, the previous barometer of market moves in London. The FTSE 100 now has a market capitalisation of almost \u00a32tn, meaning its 100 constituents \u2013 from banks and miners to retailers, airlines and housebuilders \u2013 are collectively worth less than Microsoft, which has a market cap of $2.97tn (\u00a32.4tn)."

            "date": "2024-04-08T06:00:26Z",
            "content": "Two people dressed in black are kneeling on the floor, so still that they must surely be in pain. If they are grimacing, there would be no way to know \u2013 their features are obscured by oversized, smooth gold masks, as though they have buried their faces in half an Easter egg. Their stillness makes them seem like sculptures, and only by checking for the subtle rise and fall of their chests can you confirm they are indeed human. Which is fitting, really \u2013 because they aren\u2019t actually human, at least not totally. They\u2019re human-machine hybrids, \u201cIdioms\u201d, created by French artist Pierre Huyghe for his largest ever exhibition, Liminal, at the Punta della Dogana in Venice. Idioms are wandering the exhibition for its run between March and November. Sensors in their masks monitor the rooms they sit in and visitors they encounter, and artificial intelligence will gradually convert this information into a brand new language. Slowly, for example, the Idioms\u2019 masks will come up with the words for \u201cdoor\u201d or \u201chumans\u201d or \u201cwriting\u201d \u2013 building a dictionary until they will even be able to communicate with one another. Every day, their knowledge will accumulate; Huyghe wonders what they might be able to say in 20 years\u2019 time. On a crisp March day, shortly before the exhibition opens to the public, two Idioms kneel in a darkened room opposite a large black box suspended from the ceiling \u2013 this is a \u201cself-generating instrument\u201d (also loaded with environmental sensors), producing ambient music and crisscrossing beams of light. In response to the artwork in front of them, the Idioms appear to have only generated a few syllables, repeated intermittently over and over again as the LED screens on their foreheads glow gold. Their words are a hissing whisper. It sounds a lot like, \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d It\u2019s a fair question to ask. The dilemma facing any artist who tries to tackle a subject as paradigm-changing and era-defining as artificial intelligence is that the real magic is often happening on some hard drives behind the scenes. While there is a blinking server on show at Liminal, Huyghe himself conceded at a press conference three days before opening that it might be hard for a casual visitor to understand that the language coming from the Idioms\u2019 masks is AI-generated; he worried that visitors would assume that the people wearing the masks are the ones whispering. For contemporary artists, there is a clear pressure to tackle and engage with the buzzy technology that has rapidly disrupted everything from homework to journalism since ChatGPT\u2019s debut in 2022. Like Huyghe, creatives from German film-maker Hito Steyerl to British conceptualist Gillian Wearing have used AI to make or enhance their art. Shortly after Liminal\u2019s first run closes, an ostensibly \u201cfully AI-driven\u201d multimedia exhibition of French artist Philippe Parreno\u2019s historical works will open at Haus der Kunst in Munich. Whether artists are using the technology in an interesting and challenging way or simply hoping to hop on the hype bandwagon is not always easy to discern. From a preliminary press release of the Munich show, it\u2019s unclear exactly which elements of Parreno\u2019s exhibition will be artificially intelligent, and it\u2019s easy to see how AI could cynically be slapped on to an exhibition like an Instagram filter, a shiny veneer that makes old work seem new. AI is already all around us, autocompleting our emails, suggesting a new show to watch on Netflix, and reading the weather forecast in the voice of Amazon\u2019s Alexa. In recent years, chatbots have revolutionised writing \u2013 responding to prompts to write cover letters, code, plays, poems, and essays \u2013 while text-to-image models such as DALL.E and Midjourney allow anyone to create \u201cart\u201d by typing in a few words. But as the technology becomes more prominent in our everyday lives, artists\u2019 use of AI risks feeling trite. Crowds have allegedly been \u201ctransfixed for an hour or more\u201d by Turkish artist Refik Anadol\u2019s \u201clive paintings\u201d currently being displayed at the Serpentine Gallery in London. AI was fed imagery of rainforests and coral reefs to generate Anadol\u2019s exhibition, Echoes of the Earth: Living Archive, which features immersive \u201cartificial realities\u201d that visitors can wander through. While crowds may be transfixed, critics have said that Anadol\u2019s previous AI-generated work is over-hyped. \u201cThe whole thing looks like a massive techno lava lamp,\u201d New York Magazine\u2019s Jerry Saltz wrote of Anadol\u2019s Unsupervised, a 24ft screen that used AI to continuously generate images at the Museum of Modern Art between 2022 and 2023. Saltz found the work to be pointless and mediocre \u2013 good at entertaining you briefly but ultimately \u201cnot disturbing anything inside you\u201d. In short, he felt the work had nothing to say. Saltz argued that \u201cif AI is to create meaningful art, it will have to provide its own vision and vocabulary\u201d. On a literal level, this is exactly what Huyghe\u2019s Idioms are doing. Watching them is oddly mesmerising \u2013 as a viewer, it is interesting to be confronted not with a finite state of \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d, but an ongoing process of \u201cartificial learning\u201d. Here, Huyghe\u2019s use of AI takes the art out of the artist\u2019s control, which is exciting \u2013 not least because of the possibility that things could go wrong. The Idioms could fail to produce a language or produce one that is discordant and offensive to our ears. They could be unduly influenced by rowdy exhibition-goers or rebel in some way, repeating the same words over and over again. It would undoubtedly be fascinating to return day after day and see how the Idioms have responded to the art around them. As Huyghe intended, these strange masked beings provoke questions about the relationship between the human and the non-human (even if my first thought was, \u201cI bet their knees hurt from all that kneeling\u201d). Less thought-provoking is the use of AI in his work Camata. Robotic limbs surround a skeleton in one of the world\u2019s driest deserts, performing a mysterious ritual. Though the footage is not live, the film is edited in real time, with artificially intelligent \u201ceditors\u201d gathering data from a large brass telephone-pole-like sensor near the opening of the exhibition. This sensor monitors everything from the number of guests in the gallery to the weather outside, and the Camata footage is edited accordingly. Yet curator Anne Stenne clarifies that this isn\u2019t a simple case of \u201cx\u201d leading to \u201cy\u201d \u2013 for example, if only one person was in the exhibition, it wouldn\u2019t be the case that the AI editors would automatically, say, choose footage shot at night. This means that while the endless editing process is fascinating \u2013 you could, after all, sit there for the exhibition\u2019s entire run and never see the same sequence twice \u2013 it\u2019s hard to understand as a layperson why AI was a necessary element. Would the work be any different if the editing was randomly generated? As a casual viewer, it\u2019s very hard to know. Indeed, those who attend these exhibitions simply have to trust that something fantastical is occurring behind the scenes. While Huyghe\u2019s sensors are visible throughout the exhibition, the artist is unwilling to share the details of the program that processes this information and exactly how it runs. A representative says, \u201cPierre doesn\u2019t want to focus on the technical parameters of his works. He wants to concentrate on the visitor\u2019s experience.\u201d Audiences may find this troubling in a world where companies have been found to be using \u201cpseudo-AI\u201d that is actually run by hidden humans behind the scenes. AI art works best when it does something that the artist alone could not, as is the case with Huyghe\u2019s self-generating language. Anything else risks feeling at best gimmicky and at worst pointless. Regardless, the AI trend will continue to sweep galleries, and soon enough the tool will be commonplace enough that questioning it will be like questioning a pen or a pencil. In the 1960s, \u201ccomputer art\u201d swept the globe, with exhibits from London to Stuttgart to Zagreb to Las Vegas. One contemporary writer said \u201cperhaps a computer will never produce a painting all by itself\u201d, and noted with caution that \u201cat least one expert thinks such art represents a genuine new art form\u201d. One day, undoubtedly, discussions of AI\u2019s place in art will sound this archaic. \u2022 Liminal by Pierre Huyghe is at Punda della Dogana, Venice, until 24 November"

            "content": "Amazon profits soared once again in the first quarter of 2024, the company announced on Tuesday \u2013 the latest in a series of robust earnings reports for the retail giant. The company attributed the boost to artificial intelligence and advertising sales. Amazon reported overall revenue of $143.3bn in the first three months of the year \u2013 up 13% from the same period in 2023 and surpassing Wall Street expectations of $142.65bn. The e-commerce giant reported an increase of more than 200% to $15bn, with net income more than tripling to $10.4bn from $3.17bn at the same time in 2023. In a statement accompanying the report, the chief executive, Andy Jassy, said Amazon\u2019s continuing focus on AI has \u201creaccelerat[ed]\u201d the growth rate of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company\u2019s cloud-computing sector. Revenue at AWS increased 17% year-over-year to $25bn, and AWS accounted for 62% of total operating profit. In a call following the report, Jassy said Amazon still has a lot of room to grow in the generative AI sector. The boost to AWS comes after growth in the sector had slowed recently. Executives attributed the slump to recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, which had pushed many companies to improve cloud infrastructure to support remote work. That trend is stabilizing, they said, and demand for AI can further boost its cloud services. \u201cWe remain very bullish in AWS,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cWe\u2019re at a $100bn-dollar annualized revenue run right now, and this is before you even calculate generative AI. There\u2019s a very large opportunity in front of us.\u201d Advertising sales, meanwhile, increased 24% year-over-year to $11.8bn, after the company expanded its advertising, including rolling out ads on Prime Video, starting earlier this year. As Amazon ramps up its cloud-computing and AI capabilities, it will need to spend more on infrastructure to support the technology, Jassy said on the investor call Tuesday. Capital expenditure (capex) was at $14bn for the quarter, and Jassy said it is expected to increase in subsequent quarters of the fiscal year. \u201cThe more demand AWS has, the more we have to procure new data centers\u2019 power and hardware,\u201d he said, adding that the company does not spend capital \u201cwithout very clear signals that we can monetize it\u201d. Last week, Meta\u2019s shares plummeted on news that the company would increase its capital expenditure to build up its AI capabilities. The earnings report comes after Amazon announced it would invest $11bn to build more data centers in Indiana, promising at least 1,000 jobs there. Also in the quarter, the company extended its partnership with chip manufacturer Nvidia to continue to power its AI offerings. The report underscores a positive response from investors to Amazon\u2019s recent cost-cutting measures, including laying off more than 27,000 employees since late 2022. Amazon laid off hundreds of additional staffers in early 2024. Shares were up 5% in after-hours trading."

The FT will receive an undisclosed payment as part of the deal, which is the latest to be agreed between OpenAI and news publishers. Under the arrangement, ChatGPT users will receive summaries and quotes from FT journalism, as well as links to articles, in responses to prompts, where appropriate. John Ridding, the chief executive of the FT Group, said it was \u201cright\u201d that AI companies paid publishers for their material. The New York Times is suing OpenAI and its largest investor, Microsoft, over use of its content to train large language models, the technology that underpins chatbots such as ChatGPT. \u201cOpenAI understands the importance of transparency, attribution, and compensation \u2013 all essential for us,\u201d said Ridding. \u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s clearly in the interests of users that these products contain reliable sources.\u201d OpenAI has already signed content licensing deals with the US news agency the Associated Press, the French title Le Monde, the El Pa\u00eds owner Prisa Media and Germany\u2019s Axel Springer, which publishes the Bild tabloid. Brad Lightcap, the OpenAI chief operating officer, said it was important for the company to \u201crepresent quality journalism as these products take shape\u201d. \u201cAs with any transformative technology, there is potential for significant advancements and major challenges, but what\u2019s never possible is turning back time,\u201d he said. Chatbots such as ChatGPT are at the forefront of advances in generative AI, the term for technology that can produce convincing text, image or audio from simple hand-typed prompts. However, the models that underpin these tools are trained on vast amounts of data taken from the internet, including copyright-protected text and images. Authors including Jodi Picoult, John Grisham and the Game of Thrones writer, George RR Martin, are suing OpenAI for copyright infringement in the US. Getty Images, which owns one of the largest photo collections in the world, is suing the company behind image generator Stable Diffusion in the UK on a similar basis. Last year Roula Khalaf, the FT editor, said in an open letter that a team in its newsroom would \u201cexperiment responsibly\u201d with AI tools and train journalists in using generative AI for \u201cstory discovery\u201d. However, she said it would be transparent with its use of the technology and its journalism would continue to be written by humans. Niamh Burns, a senior research analyst at Enders Analysis, said the FT\u2019s \u201chigh-quality\u201d content would be attractive to OpenAI and improve its chatbot\u2019s responses. \u201cIts material will be of real value to OpenAI for powering a chatbot that can output accurate, high-quality responses to user queries needing up-to-date information,\u201d she said. \u201cThe FT\u2019s product and brand strength also means that it is among the most insulated from any substitution risk that comes with AI products gaining steam among users.\u201d"

The technology giant has invested billions of dollars into AI in a bid to turbocharge its growth, particularly of its cloud computing services. Its cloud computing revenue surged by more than 20%. Microsoft\u2019s AI tools \u201care orchestrating a new era of AI transformation, driving better business outcomes across every role and industry\u201d, said Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft. As the group races to integrate AI across its software and services, Nadella said its Azure cloud computing business saw the pace of deals worth $100m and $10m increase by double-digit percentages. It has also started selling its Copilot AI software add-on to small businesses. Total revenue at Microsoft increased 17% to $61.86bn during the first three months of 2024, the third quarter of its financial year, surpassing analyst expectations of some $60.88bn. Earnings per share increased 20% to $2.94, ahead of the expected $2.83. Shares in the group rose 4% during after-hours trading in New York on Thursday. With a stock market value of nearly $3tn, Microsoft is the world\u2019s largest public company. Shares in the firm have increased by more than 30% over the past year \u2013 an impressive rise, although less than the rallies of Amazon and Google, whose stocks have risen by more than 60% and 40%, respectively. With a multibillion-dollar investment in the ChatGPT developer OpenAI, Microsoft has sought to position itself at the heart of AI\u2019s rise \u2013 and the destination for the industry\u2019s top talent. In March, the company announced it had hired a co-founder of Google\u2019s Deepmind AI subsidiary, Mustafa Suleyman, as well as a co-founder of $4bn startup Inflection AI and several of its employees. In November, after OpenAI\u2019s board ousted its co-founder and chief executive, Sam Altman, he briefly said he would decamp to Seattle and join Microsoft in a major coup for Nadella. The majority of OpenAI\u2019s employees said they would join Altman, which would effectively obliterate the company. Altman was reinstated as chief executive days later. Microsoft is now trying to monetize its dominance in this space. The company reported in the final months of 2023 that AI contributed 6% of the revenue growth within its powerhouse Azure cloud computing division; up from 3% the previous quarter, according to Yahoo Finance. The company said on Thursday that AI-based additions to LinkedIn had increased engagement on the professional social network. Nadella highlighted LinkedIn\u2019s AI tools for writing posts and articles, which he said helped the number of LinkedIn sessions grow by 11%. Revenue from LinkedIn increased 10%, per Microsoft\u2019s press release. It has been signing a series of high-profile AI deals. Two days before this week\u2019s earnings report, Microsoft announced that Coca-Cola had signed a five-year, $1.1bn contract with Azure for AI and cloud computing services. Last month, it announced a partnership with AI startup Mistral to offer access to the French company\u2019s models in Azure."

            "content": "Google is reportedly drawing up plans to charge for AI-enhanced search features, in what would be the biggest shake-up to the company\u2019s revenue model in its history. The radical shift is a natural consequence of the vast expense required to provide the service, experts say, and would leave every leading player in the sector offering some variety of subscription model to cover its costs. Google\u2019s proposals, first reported by the Financial Times, would entail the company exclusively offering its new search feature to users of its premium subscription services, which customers already have to sign up to if they want to use artificial intelligence assistants in other Google tools such as Gmail and its office suite. With that search experience, being trialled in beta for selected users, Google\u2019s generative AI is used to respond to queries directly with a single answer, in a similar style to the conversational approach of ChatGPT and competitors. \u201cAI search is more expensive to compute than Google\u2019s traditional search processes. So in charging for AI search Google will be seeking to at least recoup these costs,\u201d said Heather Dawe, chief data scientist at the digital transformation consultancy UST. Much of the focus within AI is on the huge expense of the computing power used to train cutting-edge generative models. In the last year Amazon ran a single training run that cost $65m (\u00a351m), according to James Hamilton, an engineer, who expects, in the near future, the company to break the $1bn mark. Last week, OpenAI and Microsoft announced plans to build a $100bn datacentre for AI training, while in January Mark Zuckerberg said his goal was to spend at least $9bn just on Nvidia GPUs alone. But the cost of training AI is just a tenth of the total cost of the sector, according to the analyst Brent Thill at the investment firm Jefferies. Thill wrote in a briefing note: \u201cThe majority of AI compute spend today is directed to the running, not training, of models, and 90%+ of AI compute spend today is being directed towards inferencing [the process by which an AI model is queried], as inferencing spend has been growing much faster than training as more models and tools get put into production.\u201d He added: \u201cSome have priced new Gen AI features at a monthly rate, betting that higher charges will cover usage expenses, while others have priced on a per-usage basis to protect themselves on the cost-side. Some have also incorporated into existing plans, hoping to drive [user] growth.\u201d Competitors in AI search offer similar subscription plans. Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, runs no adverts but offers a $20 monthly \u201cpro\u201d tier that provides access to more powerful AI models and unlimited use. Others, though, continue to offer their products at a loss. The AI features in Microsoft\u2019s Bing are free to use but tied to the company\u2019s Edge browser. The browsing and search startup Arc offers its products free to users and says it intends to raise revenue in future by charging companies for business features."

            "content": "Foreign investment approvals will be made quicker but greater scrutiny will be placed on potential risks as Australia tries to balance economic and security interests, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will say on Wednesday. The Treasury will set a target to process half of foreign investment cases needing approval within 30 days from next January, Chalmers will tell the Lowy Institute in Sydney. It will also seek more funds from abroad to support so-called build-to-rent housing ventures and the energy transition away from fossil fuels. The budget will also set aside more funds to screen foreign investments in critical infrastructure, minerals and technology. Projects involving sensitive datasets and those to be located near defence sites will also be examined more closely \u201cto ensure that all risks are identified, understood and can be managed\u201d, he will say, according to a copy of his speech. In an interview with the ABC\u2019s 7.30 program on Tuesday, Chalmers denied the foreign investment reforms were at odds with comments by the trade minister, Don Farrell, in November that Australia was not proposing any changes regarding Chinese investment in critical minerals. Chalmers said even after the changes, Australia\u2019s foreign investment regime would remain \u201cnon-discriminatory\u201d, with the same rules applying regardless of the source country. He said Australia welcomed investment that met the national interest and proposals must be screened \u201crobustly\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In his speech, Chalmers will say that the nation is facing challenges \u201cvastly different\u201d from a decade ago. These are marked by \u201cheightened geostrategic competition, an international system under continuous pressure, demographic change, greater risk of major shocks to supply chains, and a restructuring of global trade from the net zero transformation\u201d. Australia\u2019s economy has long relied on foreign investment to bolster the economy even as domestic sources, such as the $3.7tn superannuation industry, continue to grow. Competition for funds and technology is likely to intensify as governments such as the US and Europe stump up many billions of dollars to foster decarbonisation industries including batteries and renewable energy, often to catch up with China\u2019s advances. According to Chalmers, the International Monetary Fund found 18,000 instances of subsidy intervention by China, the US and Europe between 2008 and 2021. It also identified a further 2,500 cases last year alone, with those three economic blocks accounting for about half. Those trends supported the Albanese government\u2019s so-called Future Made in Australia investments, including in critical minerals processing and solar photovoltaic panel production. The 14 May federal budget is likely to contain more funds for such projects. \u201cWe can\u2019t replicate or retrofit the approaches under way elsewhere,\u201d Chalmers will say. \u201cBut it would be preposterously self-defeating to leave our policies unchanged in the face of all this industry policy taking shape and taking hold around us.\u201d Australia had to become \u201cindispensable\u201d to the global decarbonisation efforts. That could only happen, though, \u201cif we align our economic and security interests more tightly, and only if we invest and engage, not just protect or retreat\u201d. More money will go to the Treasury\u2019s compliance team to \u201cbetter monitor and enforce\u201d conditions imposed on deals by the foreign investment review board. \u201cThis team will also support the use of my call-in power to review investments that come to pose a national security concern in time,\u201d he will say. The government will also release updated guidance about tax arrangements to ensure foreign companies pay their way. Foreign investors will be allowed to buy established build-to-rent properties to foster demand and provide incentives to construct new projects. Direct and portfolio foreign investment reached about $3.5tn in 2023. As for the pending Future Made in Australia legislation, the government plans to set five key tests for its intervention, ranging from whether the investment is in an industry that the country can be competitive to its contribution \u201cto an orderly path to net zero\u201d. Other tests include the boosting of skills and support to regional Australia, and whether it improves \u201cAustralia\u2019s national security and economic resilience\u201d. But the private sector will have to play a key role in such investments and \u201cdeliver genuine value for money for government\u201d."

            "content": "Germany has said Israel\u2019s security is at \u201cthe core\u201d of its foreign policy because of the history of the Holocaust, but denied accusations at the UN\u2019s highest court that is aiding genocide in Gaza by arming Israel. Nicaragua has brought a case against Germany at the international court of justice (ICJ) urging judges to order a halt to German weapons sales to Israel, alleging it is in breach of its obligation to prevent genocide and ensure respect of international humanitarian law. On Tuesday, Germany had its chance to respond to the accusations levelled against it after Nicaragua\u2019s legal team opened the case on Monday. Nicaragua told the ICJ that it was \u201cpathetic\u201d for Germany to provide Palestinians with humanitarian aid while supplying the arms that killed them, and that Germany seemed \u201cnot to be able to differentiate between self-defence and genocide\u201d. Responding to the criticisms, Germany\u2019s representatives insisted that it supplied arms only \u201con the basis of detailed scrutiny \u2026 that far exceeds the requirements of international law\u201d. Tania von Uslar-Gleichen, legal adviser for the German foreign ministry, told the court: \u201cOur history is the reason why Israel\u2019s security has been at the core of Germany\u2019s foreign policy. \u201cWhere Germany has provided support to Israel, including in a form of export of arms and other military equipment, the quality and purposes of these supplies have been grossly distorted by Nicaragua.\u201d She added: \u201cGermany has learned from its past, a past that includes the responsibility for one of the most horrific crimes in human history, the Shoah.\u201d Despite Nicaragua\u2019s criticisms of such an argument, another lawyer, Christian Tams, emphasised that \u201cGermany continues to provide humanitarian support (in Gaza) every single day\u201d. Germany has also made clear that it believes Israel is acting in self-defence in response to the 7 October attacks in which Hamas and other Palestinian militants killed approximately 1,200 people. Israel has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians in its retaliatory offensive. Nicaragua also wants the ICJ to make Germany resume funding of Unrwa. Germany withdrew support for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees after Israel\u2019s so-far unsubstantiated allegations that 12 staff were involved in the 7 October attacks. The ICJ is expected to issue provisional measures on Nicaragua\u2019s case in weeks, but a final ruling could take years. In January, in response to a case brought against Israel by South Africa, the ICJ issued several interim measures designed to halt any potential acts of genocide. Another lawyer for Germany, Samuel Wordsworth, argued that as the ICJ had not yet ruled whether Israel was in breach of the genocide convention, Germany could not be violating the obligation to prevent genocide. \u201cHow can it be said that there was a failure to ensure respect of a third state, if the failure on the part of that third state to respect is not established in the first place?\u201d he asked."

Another Israeli strike kills civilians in Gaza. A Ukrainian city faces a fresh wave of attacks from Putin\u2019s war machine. The revelation of another cyber attack from a hostile state on UK soil. Another threat of a land grab in my ancestral home of Guyana. Another coup in the Sahel. A new flood, wildfire or hurricane \u2013 the latest manifestation of the climate emergency that is too often treated as an afterthought. The world order \u2013 which once appeared governed, at least to a large extent, by the rules we helped set up with our allies after the second world war \u2013 is now defined by a new form of geopolitical competition. Between the United States and China, over microchips, military might and trade. Between countries defined by the CIA director, William Burns, as the \u201chedging middle\u201d setting their own agendas in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Between friends and rivals alike over the green transition \u2013 on which the future of humanity depends. , Within this messy and multipolar world, Britain is still reeling from 14 years of Conservative government. Our economy is held back by recession. Our army has fewer soldiers than at any time since Napoleon. Public services are on their knees. Our international relations have been undermined by the reckless and gaffe-prone diplomacy of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak and their damaging indifference to the rule of law. We should not be pessimists. Britain still has great strengths and enormous potential. With the right leadership, we can and will navigate this new era. We remain a permanent member of the UN security council. We have the sixth largest economy in the world. Our universities, legal sectors, creatives and businesses continue to be world leaders. Our diplomats are admired by our friends as well as our rivals. But, in this newly dangerous and divided era, Britain needs a refreshed approach to foreign policy. Labour\u2019s approach to reconnect Britain, for our security and prosperity at home, will be built on progressive realism. It starts by taking the best from two of Labour\u2019s great former foreign secretaries: the realism of Ernest Bevin, who, as part of Clement Attlee\u2019s postwar Labour government helped create Nato and Britain\u2019s place within it, alongside the independent nuclear deterrent; and the progressivism of Robin Cook, whose \u201cethical dimension\u201d brought climate action and human rights into the diplomatic mainstream. Progressive realism says we must use realist means to pursue progressive ends. Instead of using realism for transactional purposes and the accumulation of power, we want to use it in the service of progressive goals: countering climate change, defending democracy, advancing economic growth and tackling inequality \u2013 abroad as well as at home. It is the pursuit of ideals without delusions about what is achievable, and comes with the recognition that the UK\u2019s interests must be defended for us to be a force for good. So, what is progressive realism in practice? It means recognising that the UK\u2019s success depends on hard-headed realism about our own nation and the continent\u2019s security, not a nostalgic misremembering of what we used to be. It means recognising that supporting Ukraine is not only a moral imperative, but a strategic necessity, and that Russia under Putin is a long-term, generational threat that requires a long-term, generational response. This is why Labour is proposing a new geopolitical partnership with the EU, from our position outside the single market and the customs union. Our proposal for a new UK-EU security pact will be designed to increase our economic, climate and national security. And it is why, as Keir Starmer committed last week, we will raise defence spending to 2.5% as soon as resources allow and make an absolute, generational commitment to the nuclear deterrent. In the face of conflict in the Middle East, in the short term, we urgently need an immediate ceasefire complied with by both sides, the immediate return of all the hostages cruelly held by Hamas terrorists, and for Israel to lift the unacceptable restrictions on aid flows to enable a massive surge of supplies into Gaza. But in the medium term, progressive realism means seeking the same things for Ukraine, Israel and Palestine: for each to be a sovereign, secure, internationally recognised state, at peace with its neighbours. This is why the next Labour government will be committed to working with international partners to recognise Palestine as a state, as a contribution to securing a negotiated two-state solution. Progressive realism means recognising that the climate emergency is the defining challenge of the next century, which requires diplomatic innovations, such as Labour\u2019s proposed clean power alliance, to counter it, but also that it represents a unique opportunity to drive jobs, growth and innovation backed by a real industrial strategy. Progressive realism is not only defined by the policies we espouse, but by the approach we will take to diplomacy. We must shake the hands of those we need for peace. Progressives must not be uncompromising about working with our partners in the Gulf. We must recognise that partnerships with the so-called global south work better than lectures and that hypocrisy \u2013 be that about sharing Covid vaccines or obeying international law \u2013 is corrosive to foreign policy. We should not fail to recognise that the US will remain the UK\u2019s most essential ally, whoever occupies the White House. Pursuing ideals will be futile, without first guaranteeing our own security. It relies on knowing that progressive policy without realism is empty idealism, just as realism without a sense of progress can become cynical and tactical. It is rooted in the optimism that when progressives act realistically and practically, they can change the world. \u2022 David Lammy is the shadow foreign secretary Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "content": "Leading players in Georgia\u2019s national men\u2019s football team have backed mass protests sparked by a \u201cforeign influence\u201d bill criticised for mirroring a repressive Russian law. Riot police have clashed in recent nights with large rallies of people protesting outside the parliament building in Tbilisi against the bill, which is viewed in Brussels as a threat to future EU membership. Jaba Kankava, the captain of Georgia\u2019s national football team, which recently qualified for Euro 2024, its first major tournament, posted a picture on Instagram of two protesters staring down riot police on Tuesday night, adding: \u201cFuck Russia.\u201d A host of other national team players, including Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, a winger for Italy\u2019s Serie A club Napoli, and Giorgi Mamardashvili, who is a goalkeeper for Valencia in Spain\u2019s La Liga, also posted what appeared to be coordinated messages on social media. They wrote: \u201cGeorgia\u2019s path is to Europe. The European way unites us!! Forward to Europe!! Peace to Georgia.\u201d David Kezerashvili, who served as Georgia\u2019s defence minister at the time of the 2008 Russian invasion of the country, said: \u201cThe footballers\u2019 decision to back the protests may prove to be a decisive intervention, coming just weeks after millions took to the streets to celebrate their Euro 2024 qualification. \u201cPeople understand the economic benefits and freedoms that membership of the European Union would bring to a country like Georgia, and they resent those aspirations being sabotaged. Seeing police in balaclavas take violent action against well-meaning protesters has dark echoes of Georgia\u2019s Soviet past. This is driving a wedge between Tbilisi and Brussels.\u201d Under a draft bill introduced to parliament on Monday, organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad will be required to register as being agents of foreign influence, with fines for those who do not comply. The law has been likened to Russian legislation under which journalists, politicians, rights organisations, environmental groups, LGBTQ support networks and others have been obliged to label themselves as \u201cforeign agents\u201d when they publish. The legislation has provoked violence inside and outside the parliament building. Footage broadcast on Monday on Georgian television showed Mamuka Mdinaradze, the leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party\u2019s parliamentary faction and a driving force behind the bill, being punched in the face by the opposition MP Aleko Elisashvili while speaking from the dispatch box. Crowds of about 10,000 people protested outside the parliament building in Tbilisi on Monday and Tuesday night, when they clashed with riot police. Despite the protests, 83 out of 150 deputies voted in favour of the bill on Wednesday, which must pass two more readings before becoming law. The ruling Georgian Dream party says the legislation is needed to promote transparency and combat \u201cpseudo-liberal values\u201d imposed from abroad. Georgia\u2019s prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, said he would not back down. He said: \u201cAs for the west, the opposition talked about this as if we consider the west as an enemy. I will repeat once again that transparency is not a criterion for distinguishing between enemies and friends. First of all, of course, a friend should be transparent, this is the friends\u2019 responsibility before the Georgian public.\u201d A spokesperson for the European Commission condemned the legislation as a risk to media and civil society freedoms. The EU gave Georgia candidate status in December. The commission spokesperson said: \u201cThis is a very concerning development and the final adoption of this legislation would negatively impact Georgia\u2019s progress on its EU path. This law is not in line with EU core norms and values.\u201d The Georgian president, Salome Zurabishvili, who is at loggerheads with the ruling party, has offered her support to the protesters, denouncing the proposed bill as \u201ca Russian strategy of destabilisation\u201d. A similar bill targeting \u201cforeign agents\u201d was dropped last year after two nights of mass protests. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said that Russia had nothing to do with the foreign agents bill, which he described as \u201cnormal practice\u201d for a government that wished to \u201cprotect themselves from outside influence\u201d. He claimed that the law was being used to \u201cprovoke anti-Russian sentiments\u201d and that \u201cit is unlikely that these impulses are being fed from within Georgia\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re probably coming from the outside,\u201d he said."

            "content": "Canada\u2019s spy agency is under pressure after Justin Trudeau and his closest advisers say they were never made aware of a report that Beijing \u201cclandestinely and deceptively\u201d interfered in both the 2019 and 2021 federal elections. Canada is in the midst of a contentious public inquiry \u201cexamining and assessing\u201d foreign interference by China, Russia, and other foreign states and non-state actors, and this week the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, testified under oath about the steps his government took to respond to the threat of meddling. In his appearance, which lasted nearly four hours, Trudeau insisted that despite the efforts from hostile states, previous federal elections \u201cheld in their integrity\u201d. \u201c[The elections] were decided by Canadians,\u201d Trudeau said. But he cast doubt on the reliability of information collected by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), which has underpinned media reporting about Beijing\u2019s alleged meddling efforts. Trudeau also said that information in a 2023 briefing note \u2013 which said that China\u2019s interference efforts were \u201cpragmatic in nature\u201d and focused primarily in supporting those with a Beijing stance or were \u201cneutral\u201d on issues of interest to the Chinese government \u2013 was never relayed to him or his staff. His remarks contrasted with testimony from the CSIS director, David Vigneault, who told the commission that the warnings in the agency\u2019s reports \u2013 including advice that the government \u201ctake decisive action and impose consequences on perpetrators\u201d \u2013 were passed on to the prime minister\u2019s inner circle. The CSIS also warned that foreign interference in Canada will persist until it \u201cis viewed as an existential threat\u201d to the country\u2019s democracy and governments respond \u201cforcefully\u201d. But neither key staffers, nor the prime minister himself, recalled those warnings. Those discrepancies prompted the head of the CSIS to be recalled to testify once again before the commission. On Friday, Vigneault told commission lawyers that while he might not have mentioned certain points on briefing notes, he conveyed those warnings to the government on other occasions, including the idea that hostile nations view election meddling as a \u201clow risk, high reward\u201d undertaking. Vigneault added that his agency\u2019s method for briefing officials was \u201cnot just one method and one person\u201d to ensure key figures were brought up to speed. Speaking to reporters after his testimony, the prime minister deepened the rift between his government and the spy agency over the accuracy of CSIS reports by suggesting \u201cno government, no leader\u201d should \u201csimply be a passive receiver\u201d of information and intelligence. \u201cWe have a role to play in asking questions, on thinking critically \u2026 encouraging further work on questioning sources and pulling out contradictions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat actually is part and parcel of the work that we all need to do to make sure that everything is done to keep Canadians safe.\u201d Among the issues was reports that the CSIS had warned the Liberal party about possible Chinese interference in the nomination of Han Dong in Toronto. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel there was sufficient or sufficiently credible information that would justify this very significant step as to remove a candidate,\u201d Trudeau said. The prime minister himself has come under fire from political opponents after telling the commission he didn\u2019t read briefing notes, instead preferring to receive key information in person or over a secure line from his national security adviser or top intelligence officials, including Vigneault. \u201cWhen there is actually a risk of manipulation by hostile and malicious actors like, say, a communist regime in Beijing, he can\u2019t even take the responsibility of reading his briefing notes,\u201d said the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre. Beijing has previously denied all allegations of meddling in Canadian affairs and a spokesperson for the embassy said Trudeau had \u201cslandered\u201d China during the inquiry hearing. The commission, overseen by Quebec appeals court judge Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue, will complete an initial report by 3 May and deliver its final report by the end of 2024."

            "content": "Donald Trump dodged financial calamity on Monday. The office of Letitia James, the New York attorney general, and lawyers for Trump reached agreement in open court on the terms governing the appellate bond posted by the former president. After nearly an hour of argument and an extended recess, the parties achieved a workable solution. It is a ray of sunshine in Trump\u2019s otherwise bleak legal landscape. Trump would be required to leave $175m in cash only as collateral for the bond. Mutual funds or other securities will not suffice. In addition, the brokerage account holding the funds would fall under the exclusive control of the bonding company. Trump would no longer maintain any authority over the account. In turn, James remains barred from enforcing her $454m judgment against Trump and his businesses. For those keeping score, Trump is now out-of-pocket in a neighborhood north of a quarter of a billion dollars and counting. His pretense of being cash-rich is soiled. In March, he shelled out for a separate $91.63m bond while he appeals the $83.3m verdict in the latest E Jean Carroll defamation case. Earlier, he paid another $4m into court to block Carroll from collecting a prior defamation judgment, also on appeal. The stock price of Trump Media &amp; Technology Group \u2013 his eponymous meme stock, DJT \u2013 is in the doldrums. Politico also reports that Save America, a Trump-controlled Pac, has already spent $59m on his legal fees and may run shortly out of money. Beyond that, Trump World tussles with Ken Griffin, a major Republican donor and the chief of Citadel Securities, a leading Wall Street market-maker. Last Thursday, Devin Nunes \u2013 the former Republican congressman who resigned from the House to run Trump\u2019s media company \u2013 wrote to the head of the Nasdaq, raising the issue of \u201cpotential market manipulation\u201d of DJT stock and blasting \u201cnaked short-selling\u201d. Griffin, whose wealth is estimated at a cool $37bn, quickly struck back. He branded Nunes a \u201cproverbial loser\u201d whom Trump \u201cwould have fired on The Apprentice\u201d. He also accused the humorless Californian of trying to deflect blame for DJT\u2019s lackluster stock price. The hush-money trial in Manhattan, however, is presently Trump\u2019s greatest fear. On Monday, the case finally kicked off with opening arguments. David Pecker, of the National Enquirer, will reportedly be the prosecution\u2019s first witness \u2013 but not the witness likely to garner the most attention. Not even close. Stormy Daniels, the adult film star, will eventually take center stage, with assists from Hope Hicks, an ex-senior Trump White House aide, and Karen McDougal, a Playboy model and one-time playmate of the year. Testimony by Daniels and McDougal will likely turn graphic. According to reports, Hicks has already met with prosecutors. Purportedly, she was involved in negotiations aimed at preventing Daniels from publicly disclosing her alleged trysts with Melania\u2019s husband and Ivanka\u2019s dad. For the record, neither woman is expected to attend the trial. The criminal case also involves alleged hush-money payments to McDougal. She too claims that she had sex with Trump, albeit \u201cmany dozens of times\u201d. \u201cI was in love with him. He was in love with me,\u201d she said in a 2019 interview. \u201cI know that because he told me all the time. \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018You\u2019re my baby and I love you.\u2019 He showed me off to his friends.\u201d The sincerity of Trump\u2019s purported displays of extramarital affection may likely be met with disbelief by at least one jury member. In court, the juror disclosed that she thought Trump to be \u201cvery selfish and self-serving\u201d. Last Friday, Juan Merchan, the trial judge, looked at Trump and sternly announced: \u201cSir, can you please have a seat.\u201d To some, it sounded as if Merchan were talking to an unruly dog. On Monday, the court ruled that if Trump takes the witness stand, he may be cross-examined over past bad acts. Don\u2019t hold your breath on Trump testifying in his own defense. It would likely be embarrassing, if not necessarily perjurious. The emcee of Mar-a-Lago stands diminished. Together, all this may be straining his coping mechanisms, wallet and poll numbers. In contrast, Joe Biden demonstrates renewed political vitality. On Saturday, he scored a major legislative victory, a foreign aid package that bolstered Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Punchbowl\u2019s headline blared: \u201cAttention House GOP: Biden is the winner\u201d. Looking back, when Trump complained to Randall Stephenson, then CEO of AT&amp;T, of women being the bane of his existence he wasn\u2019t far off. Among female voters, Trump consistently trails Biden by double digits. Meanwhile, James stands ever ready to separate the man from his money. \u201cFor the next six weeks, a man who values control and tries to shape environments and outcomes to his will is in control of very little,\u201d wrote Maggie Haberman. His image as a pugnacious rule breaker will likely get dinged. \u201cVagina is expensive,\u201d Trump once reportedly told radio shock-jock Howard Stern. Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York and served in the US Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992"

There had initially been reports of a suspicious item on a plane, but West Midlands police later confirmed that the item was not suspicious, and the airport reopened at 6pm. A spokesperson for the airport said on Tuesday evening: \u201cThe aircraft landed safely and all passengers and crew have disembarked. All customers due to travel should make their way to the airport and check in as normal.\u201d A number of flights due to arrive at the airport were delayed, however, with the arrivals board showing flights from around 4.20pm being held up. The package was found on an Aer Lingus flight, which took off for Belfast at 2.52pm. A spokesperson for Aer Lingus told Sky News: \u201cWe can confirm that an undeclared item discovered on Aer Lingus Regional flight EI3647, operated by Emerald Airlines, from Birmingham to Belfast today was not a security risk. \u201cOur teams are currently working to accommodate impacted passengers.\u201d When the plane landed, its crew and ground staff were able to quickly evacuate all those on board from the craft, sources told the Guardian. Police and specialists attended and carried out a rapid assessment of whether the object posed any immediate danger. A specialist police unit searched the plane, a spokesperson said, adding that the incident was a \u201cfalse call with very good intent\u201d. Birmingham airport urged people to check their flights before checking in due to potential delays. The UK threat level from terrorism remains at \u201csubstantial\u201d, meaning an attack is likely.

            "date": "2024-04-30T10:30:24Z",
            "content": "As the clock hit full time at Ashton Gate on Sunday evening, Bristol City finally succumbed to the inevitable. Relegation was confirmed after a 4-0 defeat to Manchester City, a final nail in the coffin in their Women\u2019s Super League campaign. Only 371 days after achieving promotion, the Robins were condemned to the Championship to start rebuilding once again. The table does not lie. With only one win all season \u2013 a thrilling 3-2 triumph at West Ham in November \u2013 Bristol City\u2019s struggles have been evident. Their defensive problems, in particular, have been impossible to ignore. Context is key, however, particularly in a sport where the parameters are quickly shifting. The odds were stacked against Lauren Smith\u2019s side as soon as they lifted the Championship trophy in April 2023. \u201cIt was a relegation fight before we even kicked the ball,\u201d says Smith. As one of only two teams in the WSL without the backing of a Premier League side \u2013 Leicester City are the other and they are an incomparable operation \u2013 they have had to be creative in their approach. With a tight budget, Smith and her staff were always restricted by who they could recruit. Adding the experience of Megan Connolly and Satara Murray while retaining the services of Rachel Furness were all sensible moves. It could not be predicted, however, that two of those three, along with the long-serving forward Abi Harrison, would spend much of the season on the sidelines. The injury list has been extensive: Fran Bentley, the No 1 goalkeeper, picked up a knee problem; Kaylan Marckese and Jess Simpson were brought in on loan but soon returned to their parent clubs after suffering ACL injuries. Brooke Aspin and Naomi Layzell, stalwarts of the backline, have also been unavailable at points. When you are in a dogfight, you need luck to go your way. The injury pile-up has meant that Smith has had to rely on her younger players. Bristol City have fielded the youngest average lineup in the division (24 years, 136 days) and given more minutes to teenagers than anyone else. While developing their academy players has been a core ethos of the club, and one that should be admired, it has been a baptism of fire. \u201cThere\u2019s been big spells where we\u2019ve had academy players on our bench, which is great in terms of our academy and they\u2019re available to do it,\u201d Smith says. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s a big gulf between academy football and the WSL and it\u2019s a big ask.\u201d They could add only three players in January, in a transfer window that, on reflection, should have been more of a priority. With Bristol City\u2019s fate sealed, the rebuild will start with a focus on the successes they have had. Off the pitch they have cultivated one of the better match-day experiences, attracting an average attendance of more than 7,000, the fifth highest in the WSL. It is to the club\u2019s credit that Gavin Marshall, chief executive of Bristol Sport Group, made an immediate statement of commitment to the women\u2019s team on Sunday night. The juxtaposition between their response and Reading\u2019s last season \u2013 the Royals were moved to a part-time model once relegation was confirmed \u2013 is stark and provides hope. The challenge will be significant with investment only increasing. The Championship is intensely competitive and immediate success is far from guaranteed. This year\u2019s champions, Crystal Palace, have increased the resources available to the team only over the past couple of years. How they make the step up remains to be seen, especially given the fast-track nature of their rise. But there will be less anxiety given the foundations already in place. For Bristol City, the future is uncertain but far from disheartening, despite the growing disparity in finances. Player retention is crucial, as is continued faith in Smith, widely regarded as one of the brightest young managers around. They are the heart of women\u2019s football for the south-west and a beacon of their community. Their underdog status will endure. \u201cWomen\u2019s football is at a key point,\u201d Smith said on Sunday night. \u201cNobody knows what it\u2019s going to look like in the next few years \u2026 we want to be part of that. The players, the club and I are ambitious to make sure that, just like last time, we are committed to going back up.\u201d Get in touch If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email moving.goalposts@theguardian.com.

            "title": "Top Labour figures met financial services firms after \u00a3150k donation",
            "date": "2024-04-13T11:36:49Z",
            "content": "Senior members of the shadow cabinet have held a private meeting with a group of financial services companies to discuss the party\u2019s banking policies just weeks after one of the companies donated \u00a3150,000 to the party. Six senior Labour figures \u2013 including the leader, Keir Starmer, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and the shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds \u2013 attended the meeting in Edinburgh last December, according to an investigation by the website OpenDemocracy. Companies in attendance included the investment managers Baillie Gifford and Aegon, as well as Bloomberg and NatWest. Bloomberg had just donated its largest sum in years through its trading subsidiary. According to a now-deleted LinkedIn post by an employee of one of the companies at the meeting, Starmer and his ministerial team offered those in attendance an \u201cexclusive dive\u201d into the launch of its financial services policy. The revelations have sparked concerns about the possibility the party is allowing its top donors to help shape policy in a way that could further their corporate interests. Steve Goodrich, the head of research and investigations at Transparency International UK, said: \u201cParties should scrupulously avoid the perception that they\u2019re offering privileged political access in return for cash. The next general election looks set to be the most expensive in modern times, so it\u2019s crucial that politicians of all stripes avoid stumbling into quid pro quos in the rush for funds.\u201d A Labour party spokesperson said: \u201cIt is standard practice for the Labour party to meet with the private sector.\u201d Bloomberg declined to comment. Starmer and Reeves have made it a priority to win back support from the City of London in recent years. They have embarked on a series of meetings with business leaders described as the \u201cprawn cocktail offensive 2.0\u201d, in reference to similar efforts by Tony Blair in the 1990s. As part of that, the party has overhauled its approach to the financial services sector, including appointing a panel of 10 advisers from the City and clarifying that it will not reimpose a cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses. In December, shadow ministers travelled to Edinburgh to present the new panel and to highlight their commitment to boosting the sector. Tulip Siddiq, the shadow City minister, told the Financial Times before the visit that her party had stopped \u201csneering at business\u201d. The OpenDemocracy investigation has found that during the visit, Siddiq and her colleagues attended a roundtable meeting convened by Bloomberg and the lobbying group Sovereign Strategy. Other senior Labour figures who attended included Anas Sarwar, the party\u2019s leader in Scotland, and Daniel Johnson, the member of the Scottish parliament for Edinburgh Southern. Electoral Commission records show that Bloomberg Trading Facility \u2013 the company\u2019s platform for trading financial investment products \u2013 gave Labour \u00a3150,000 about a month before the meeting, the largest sum given by any Bloomberg company since the Brexit referendum in 2016. That single donation made Bloomberg one of the party\u2019s top corporate donors for the whole year. One of the lobbyists involved in setting up the meeting posted afterwards on LinkedIn that it had offered \u201ca very thorough discussion on Labour\u2019s vision and priorities for economic growth, outlook for the financial services industry and an exclusive dive into Labour\u2019s launch of the financial services policy review\u201d. Labour later published a video from the event showing Starmer speaking while his shadow ministers looked on. The party did not say which companies attended the meeting, but the video shows Starmer telling them: \u201cWhat you now see is a Labour party that is fundamentally different to the Labour party that fought the last general election. Unrecognisably different. And very obviously pro-business.\u201d The following month, Labour announced its new financial services plan, in which it promised to cut down 10,000 pages of regulations and ruled out a windfall tax on bank profits. Reeves said at the time: \u201cAs chancellor of the exchequer, I would want to be a champion of a successful and thriving financial services industry in the UK.\u201d Simon Youel, the head of policy and advocacy at the campaign group Positive Money, said: \u201cWhat is most concerning is that weeks after this meeting, Labour published a plan for financial services that reads like a love letter to big finance, with much in there that could have been written by the industry itself.\u201d A Bloomberg spokesperson said: \u201cBloomberg entities have a long history of donating to both of the UK\u2019s main political parties. As Electoral Commission records show, we have a track record of relative parity of support across both Labour and the Conservatives over multiple years. \u201cThis event formed part of a regular series of engagements between businesses and UK policymakers.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-21T09:30:52Z",
            "content": "Ecuadoreans will vote on Sunday in a referendum on a raft of unprecedented security measures designed to empower the police and armed forces in the fight against spiralling violence and organised crime. Voters must accept or reject 11 questions, mostly about security, in the plebiscite, which is being seen as a test of support for Ecuador\u2019s popular young president. Daniel Noboa, who took office in November on a pledge to combat the surge in violent crime, put forward the poll to push through proposals to retake control of prisons and tame soaring homicide rates. Long seen as an oasis of peace compared with its neighbours, Ecuador last year became the most violent country in South America with a record number of about 8,000 homicides. The number of violent deaths has grown eightfold in just six years as bloodshed between warring drug gangs spilled from jails on to the streets. Noboa declared a state of \u201cinternal armed conflict\u201d in January, designating 22 drug trafficking gangs as terrorist groups and authorising Ecuador\u2019s military to \u201cneutralise\u201d the crime factions \u201cwithin the bounds of international humanitarian law\u201d. Since then, the 36-year-old son of a banana billionaire has ordered the armed forces on to the streets and presided over the arrest of tens of thousands of people accused of links to organised crime. Now, with this referendum, Noboa says he wants to consolidate the reduction in violent crime by allowing the military to patrol with police, extraditing convicted drug kingpins or gang leaders, and boosting prison sentences for crimes such as terrorism and murder. Ecuadoreans \u2013 weary of extortion and fearful about kidnapping and violent crime \u2013have largely welcomed Noboa\u2019s mano dura policies \u201cAs victims of violence, the population believes that the \u2018iron fist\u2019 policies and the presence of the armed forces on the street and in the prisons can solve their problems,\u201d said Fernando Carri\u00f3n, a security expert with the Latin American Social Sciences Institute in Quito. Noboa was one of Latin America and the Caribbean\u2019s most popular leaders, with a 67% approval rating, according to a poll compiled by the Americas Society in January. However, his handling of an electricity shortage last week, which led to a power rationing and two days of public holiday, could dent polling in favour of his proposals this Sunday, said Carri\u00f3n. It was not clear how his controversial decision to storm the Mexican embassy in Quito earlier this month in a bid to arrest a former vice-president wanted on embezzlement charges would boost or reduce his popularity, he added. While other referendum proposals about loosening employment contracts and international arbitration were less popular, security-focused questions would likely have broad support, Carri\u00f3n added. Leonidas Iza, president of Conaie, Ecuador\u2019s main indigenous federation, said the \u201cbacksliding of labour rights could not be allowed\u201d and warned labour exploitation could be normalised. \u201cWhile President Daniel Noboa\u2019s security crackdown has drawn significant international criticism over human rights concerns, it has boosted his domestic popularity,\u201d said Erin Drake of the security consultancy S-RM. Noboa, who will complete the term of former president Guillermo Lasso, who stepped down to avoid impeachment last year, is expected to seek re-election in 2025. \u201cThis referendum is not only about security questions but also about recognising the president\u2019s legitimacy and putting him in a good position for 2025,\u201d said Carri\u00f3n."

            "date": "2024-04-19T17:20:32Z",
            "content": "Unilever is to scale back its environmental and social aims, provoking critics to say its board should \u201chang their heads in shame\u201d. The consumer goods company behind brands ranging from Dove beauty products to Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice-cream was seen as perhaps the foremost proponent of corporate ethics \u2013 particularly under the tenure of its Dutch former boss Paul Polman. On Friday, the London-based firm\u2019s current chief executive appeared to signal a strategic U-turn for the company, which is valued at \u00a394bn on the London Stock Exchange. In an interview with Bloomberg, Hein Schumacher confirmed plans to water down the company\u2019s ethical pledges on a range of issues including plastic usage and pay. The shift comes amid a wider trend of pressure from shareholders in corporations ranging from banks to oil companies to cut costs and focus more on stock market performance than green projects. Unilever, one of the largest users of plastic packaging in the world, had previously promised to halve its use of virgin plastics by 2025. Instead, it will now aim for a reduction of a third by 2026, Bloomberg reported. The less ambitious target equates to about 100,000 tonnes more fresh plastic every year. The company is also abandoning a pledge to pay direct suppliers a living wage by 2030, instead proposing fair pay for suppliers accounting for half its annual spend on goods and services by 2026. It is also dropping a promise to spend \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.7bn) a year with diverse businesses by 2025 and a commitment that 5% of its workforce will be made up of people with disabilities by the same year. Schumacher said people\u2019s focus on environmental and social issues was \u201ccyclical\u201d. \u201cWhen you have a huge drought for a number of months but everything else is going fine, the attention is on climate. These days it\u2019s about wars and rightly so, that\u2019s at the forefront. \u201cI\u2019m not going to shout that we\u2019re saving the world, but I want to make sure that in everything that we do, that it is indeed better,\u201d he added. He insisted that the company could still \u201cmake a difference\u201d in the four key areas of climate, plastics, nature and people\u2019s livelihoods. Nina Schrank, the head of plastics at Greenpeace UK, said Unilever bosses \u201cshould hang their heads in shame\u201d. \u201cHein Schumacher and his board are well aware of the ruinous impact of their plastic pollution,\u201d she said. \u201cThe tsunami of plastic they produce each year meant their existing targets were already not fit for purpose. We needed much more. And so rather than doubling down, they\u2019re quietly dressing up their backpedalling and low ambition as worthy pragmatism.\u201d Unilever\u2019s dilution of its ethical stance follows a period of worsening performance in which the company\u2019s shares have fallen by 8% since Schumacher took over in July 2023. Under Polman \u2013 and his successor Alan Jope \u2013 Unilever became increasingly involved in ethical initiatives. It promised to invest \u20ac1bn over 10 years in green projects and provided funding from its cleaning brand Domestos for a Unicef project to improve access to toilets in India. The firm last month released plans to cut 7,500 jobs globally and spin off its ice-cream division as part of an overhaul aimed at saving about \u20ac800m over the next three years."

            "date": "2024-04-16T09:10:14Z",
            "content": "Superdry is to embark on a restructuring plan including rent reductions in stores and a fundraising, backed by its boss and co-founder Julian Dunkerton, and will quit the London Stock Exchange. Trading in the company\u2019s shares was halted on Tuesday morning after they fell 25% to just over 5p, a record low, valuingit at about \u00a36m. At its peak in early 2018, Superdry was worth \u00a31.7bn. The struggling British fashion retailer, once the hottest fashion label on the high street and known for its hoodies and jackets, announced the shake-up a fortnight after Dunkerton decided against making a takeover offer with partners. Superdry hopes the measures will return the business to a \u201cmore stable footing\u201d and warned that \u201cunless the restructuring plan comes into effect, it will need to enter administration\u201d. The three-year restructuring plan, a formal procedure under the Companies Act for companies in financial difficulties, is expected to result in rent reductions on 39 UK sites, the extension of the due date of loans, and \u201cmaterial\u201d cash savings from rent and business rate changes. It has 216 company-owned shops as well as franchised stores. Dunkerton, who began selling clothing on a market stall in Cheltenham and co-founded Superdry in 2003, has a 26.4% stake in the company and is supporting the fundraising, which is expected to raise up to \u00a310m. Superdry said by delisting it would \u201cbenefit from significant cost savings associated with being listed and implement its turnaround plan away from the heightened exposure of public markets\u201d. Its shares are expected to cease trading in July. In January, the company said it was considering store closures and job cuts after a year of falling sales and deepening losses. The brand\u2019s popularity has waned in recent years, as it has struggled to appeal to younger shoppers despite teaming up with influencers and stepping up its marketing on Instagram and TikTok. Dunkerton said: \u201cThese proposals are putting the business on the right footing to secure its long-term future following a period of unprecedented challenges. I am aware of the implications for all our stakeholders and I have sought to protect their interests as much as possible in the proposals we are announcing today. \u201cMy decision to underwrite this equity raise demonstrates my continued commitment to Superdry, its stakeholders, its suppliers and the people who work for it. My passion for this great British brand remains as strong today as it was when I founded the business.\u201d Peter Sj\u04e7lander, the chair, said: \u201cWhile we recognise the compromises we are asking from some of our stakeholder groups, we would urge them to support the proposals which we believe are the best way of ensuring Superdry\u2019s recovery over the long term.\u201d Superdry said trading conditions continued to be \u201cchallenging\u201d and that without the restructuring plan, the company would need to enter into administration."

            "date": "2024-04-19T12:41:41Z",
            "content": "For the snooker purists, it was the sight nobody wanted to see just days out from the most prestigious tournament on the sport\u2019s calendar. Debate has raged for years about whether or not the world championship will eventually have to leave its spiritual home of the Crucible and this week, in the buildup to the 2024 edition, there was what felt a significant moment. The world championship will remain in Sheffield until 2027 at least but the sight of Barry and Eddie Hearn, flanked by the seven-time world champion, Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan, in Saudi Arabia to announce that Riyadh Season, a state-funded sports and entertainment festival, was to become an official partner for the tournament would have sent a shiver through the spines of those who adore the Crucible. O\u2019Sullivan, never one to shy away from offering his opinion, went one step further. \u201cI think Saudi Arabia could get hold of this tournament, grab it by the scruff of the neck and turn it into a Wimbledon or a French Open or US Open, and really make it a super event,\u201d he said. It feels like the greatest existential threat to the Crucible\u2019s chances of retaining the tournament in the long term. There has always been whispers of potentially moving away but Saudi Arabia muscling in on the scene feels very real, not least given how O\u2019Sullivan triumphed in the inaugural World Masters there last month. The concerns about the Crucible are, sentiment aside, fairly understandable. The venue has only 980 seats and the world\u2019s top players are often left lamenting the standard of the facilities backstage. Yet when the world championship gets going and the tournament switches to its one-table setup later in the event, there is really nothing quite like it, with the history seeping from the walls. But while the topic of change is back on the agenda for the tournament, the lineup has a feel of familiarity. There is one debutant in the 32-player field this year: Joe O\u2019Connor, who came through a late-night, nerve-shredding qualifier against Matthew Selt this week to book his place. All the participants are inside the world\u2019s top 45, and it is the usual suspects who headline the bill once again, O\u2019Sullivan chief among them. His bid for a record eighth world title begins on Wednesday against Wales\u2019s Jackson Page, and the Rocket is bidding to become only the fourth player in history to win snooker\u2019s triple crown events \u2013 the UK Championship, the Masters and the worlds \u2013 in the same season. At 48, he remains at the peak of his powers and is the favourite once again. For the defending champion, though, things look very different. Luca Brecel\u2019s victory in last year\u2019s final drew immediate comparisons to O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s breakthrough in the 1990s but the Belgian has found the going tough in the past 12 months. He is 37th on the one-year rankings list and has been handed a tough opening draw against the accomplished world No 31, David Gilbert. As is traditional for the world champion, Brecel will open the tournament when play begins on Saturday morning. Of the other contenders Judd Trump has been one of the two best players in the world this season alongside O\u2019Sullivan, Mark Williams remains a genuine threat over the longer format, while Mark Selby and Shaun Murphy will also hope to win another world title. As the sport heads en masse to South Yorkshire for the next fortnight, it feels like an appropriate moment to take a step back and enjoy the history and drama the Crucible provides. The threat of relocation halfway around the world has never felt so real; with O\u2019Sullivan in the ascendancy things may remain constant on the baize but wholesale change could soon be on its way off it."

            "date": "2024-04-19T13:55:35Z",
            "content": "Good morning, Israel carried out airstrikes against Iran on Friday and explosions were reported in the sky over the cities of Isfahan and Tabriz. The Iranian government sought to play down the scale of the attack. Officials in Washington confirmed Israeli forces were carrying out military operations against Iran. Iranian state media said drones had been shot down over Isfahan province and sought to reassure citizens. A senior Iranian official told Reuters there was no plan for immediate retaliation. Meanwhile, on Thursday night the US vetoed a Palestinian request to the UN security council for full United Nations membership, blocking the world body\u2019s recognition of a Palestinian state. What is the context? The Israeli strike is in retaliation for a Iranian aerial attack involving 300 missiles and drones on Sunday morning, Iran\u2019s first ever attack on the Jewish state, which in turn was a reprisal for the bombing of an Iranian consular building in Damascus on 1 April. What does it say about US-Israeli relations? Benjamin Netanyahu defied Joe Biden, who had urged Israel not to respond militarily but to \u201ctake the win\u201d of having shot down Iranian missiles. How was the UN security council vote on Palestinian UN membership split? The 15-member body voted 12 in favor, the US opposed, and two abstentions, the UK and Switzerland. All 12 jurors seated in Trump hush-money trial after two dismissals A full jury of 12 people has been seated in the criminal case against Donald Trump. The development came after two jurors were removed \u2013 underscoring the difficulty of choosing a jury in one of the most high-stakes cases in US history \u2013 and after the judge criticised the press corps. It was the third day of Trump\u2019s hush-money trial and a continuation of the tricky process of jury selection. Trump, the first former US president to face criminal trial, sat expressionless throughout the session on Thursday morning and appeared attentive. What happens next? The court still needs to appoint six alternate jurors. At least one alternate had been selected before court concluded on Thursday. How did the judge rebuke the press? He said to exercise \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201crefrain from anything that has to do, for example, with physical descriptions\u201d of jurors. He prohibited reporting on employers of jurors. It came after Fox News ran a segment on Tuesday that directly attacked jury members. What will the 12 jurors decide? Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records over an alleged $130,000 hush-money scheme involving Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. He pleads not guilty. Over 100 arrested for Columbia protest against Israeli attack on Gaza after university president calls in NYPD More than 100 people were arrested at Columbia University on Thursday \u2013 including the daughter of the Democratic representative Ilhan Omar \u2013 after the school\u2019s president called in the New York police department to break up student protests over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Tents were pitched on the central campus of the Ivy League school on Wednesday, and hundreds of students demonstrated to call for the university to financially divest from Israel, and for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The university\u2019s president, Minouche Shafik, said: \u201cI authorized the New York police department to begin clearing the encampment [because organizers] violated a long list of rules and policies.\u201d What is the context? Since 7 October, tensions have flared on college campuses across the US. Students have protested against the Israeli war effort and the US\u2019s support, while Jewish voices have alleged rising antisemitism. Who organized the protest? A coalition of Columbia University Apartheid Divest, Students for Justice in Palestine, and Jewish Voice for Peace. Columbia says the organizations have been suspended for violating school policies on holding events. Columbia has a history of campus radicalism, with students occupying university buildings in 1968 to protest against the US war in Vietnam. What prompted Shafik to call in the NYPD? It is unclear. The demonstration was nonviolent. On Wednesday, Shafik was grilled by a House committee over antisemitism on campus. Similar testimonies from the presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania led to them stepping down.

            "date": "2024-04-11T00:20:22Z",
            "content": "Victoria police have launched a new bid to find the body of the missing Ballarat woman Samantha Murphy, with officers searching the Enfield state park, about 25km south of the regional city, on Thursday. Murphy, 51, was last seen more than two months ago, when she left her Ballarat East home to go for a run. Last month police charged 22-year-old Patrick Stephenson with Murphy\u2019s murder, after arresting him in the nearby farming town of Scotsburn. Victoria police on Thursday said \u201cintelligence derived from a number of sources\u201d had led them to the new search area. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cPolice will today conduct a significant search of bushland in the Enfield State Park area as part of the ongoing investigation into the disappearance of Ballarat East woman Samantha Murphy,\u201d police said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cToday\u2019s search will be undertaken in an area within the Enfield State Park and will focus on trying to locate Samantha\u2019s body.\u201d Police urged members of the public to refrain from joining the search. After Murphy\u2019s disappearance Ballarat locals organised volunteer-led searches in an effort to assist the investigation. Police said Murphy\u2019s family had been informed about the fresh search. Acting Det Supt Mark Hatt said the search would involve a number of detectives from the missing persons squad and specialist police. \u201cI want to assure those in the Ballarat community that police remain focused on doing everything we can to return Samantha to her family,\u201d he said. Hatt said since Murphy\u2019s disappearance, police had conducted a range of searches and other inquiries as part of their investigation. \u201cThis includes extensive large-scale searches such as we have planned this week, but also smaller targeted searches focused in very specific areas,\u201d he said. Investigators from the search and rescue squad, the mounted branch, dog squad, the public order response team and motorcyclists will be involved in the search. Last month a police-led search for Murphy that zeroed in on bushland in the Buninyong area, south of Ballarat, concluded without finding the alleged murder victim. Previous searches also focused in on the Woowookarung regional park, known by locals as the Canadian forest, on the south-eastern fringe of Ballarat. Police charged Stephenson on 6 March and he was remanded into custody. He is due to appear at Ballarat magistrates court on 8 August. Murphy\u2019s husband, Michael, issued an emotional plea after police charged Stephenson, saying he hoped the 22-year-old had information that would help police find the body. Police have not disclosed how Murphy was allegedly murdered but the commissioner, Shane Patton, alleged it was an \u201cintentional act\u201d. He said Stephenson was not known to Murphy\u2019s family and alleged that he had acted alone. Murphy\u2019s family reported the mother of three missing when she did not return home from a 7am run on Sunday 4 February. She had told family and friends she planned to go for a 14km run."

            "date": "2024-04-25T20:47:26Z",
            "content": "America\u2019s leading stock indices came under pressure on Thursday after official data revealed that US economic growth slowed sharply to its weakest rate in almost two years. But as high interest rates take their toll on the world\u2019s largest economy, inflation continues to loom large. The Dow Jones industrial average fell by as much as 1.8% in New York before recovering to close down 1%. The S&amp;P 500 also dropped by as much as 1.5%, before finishing down 0.5%. The technology-focused Nasdaq declined 1.9%, before clawing back some of its losses to close down 0.6%. Gross domestic product increased at an annualized rate of 1.6% in the first quarter, significantly short of the 2.4% rate expected by economists. But a closely watched measure of inflation also rose faster than anticipated, raising questions about the Federal Reserve\u2019s next steps in its fight to bring down price growth. The so-called \u201ccore\u201d personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index \u2013 which strips out volatile food and energy costs \u2013 rose 3.7% in the first three months of the year, according to a report published by the commerce department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis. The same measure rose by 2% in the last quarter of 2023. While economists had expected an acceleration, the reading was higher than the average 3.4% forecast. Inflation has been easing in the US, with unemployment remaining low and growth largely resilient, raising hopes that the Fed will guide the world\u2019s largest economy to a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d, where price growth normalizes and recession is avoided. But Thursday\u2019s data on the first quarter \u2013 with growth fading, and inflation on the rise \u2013 will test this confidence. \u201cQ1\u2019s sluggish increase in GDP likely sets the tone for the rest of 2024,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, predicting that core PCE inflation \u201cwill rise at an annualized rate much closer to 2%\u201d over the next few months. The first quarter\u2019s core inflation reading could \u201cspook the Fed a little\u201d, said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. \u201cThe core PCE deflator rose 3.7% at an annualized rate in Q1, nearly double the clip seen in each of the prior two quarters and stronger than either we or the consensus anticipated.\u201d While inflation has slowed dramatically since peaking at its highest level in a generation two summers ago, prices still remain far higher than where they stood before the pandemic. The economy is at the heart of this year\u2019s presidential election campaign, as voters mull whether they felt better off under Joe Biden, or the Trump administration. \u201cThe landing is, and will be, soft,\u201d Biden declared during his State of the Union address last month. \u201cIt takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it. Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring.\u201d But Donald Trump, who is fighting to regain the presidency in November, has claimed inflation is \u201ckilling America\u201d under Biden. On Thursday Janet Yellen, Biden\u2019s treasury secretary, told Reuters that the US economy \u201ccontinues to perform very, very well\u201d, describing the latest growth as \u201cpeculiar, but not concerning\u201d.

            "date": "2024-04-25T18:00:16Z",
            "content": "Noise pollution from traffic stunts growth in baby birds, even while inside the egg, research has found. Unhatched birds and hatchlings that are exposed to noise from city traffic experience long-term negative effects on their health, growth and reproduction, the study found. \u201cSound has a much stronger and more direct impact on bird development than we knew before,\u201d said Dr Mylene Mariette, a bird communication expert at Deakin University in Australia and a co-author of the study, published in the journal Science. \u201cIt would be wise to work more to reduce noise pollution.\u201d A growing body of research has suggested that noise pollution causes stress to birds and makes communication harder for them. But whether birds are already distressed at a young age because they are affected by noise, or by how noise disrupts their environment and parental care, was still unclear. Mariette\u2019s team routinely exposed zebra finch eggs for five days to either silence, soothing playbacks of zebra finch songs, or recordings of city traffic noises such as revving motors and cars driving past. They did the same with newborn chicks for about four hours a night for up to 13 nights, without exposing the birds\u2019 parents to the sounds. They noticed that the bird eggs were almost 20% less likely to hatch if exposed to traffic noise. The chicks that did hatch were more than 10% smaller and almost 15% lighter than the other hatchlings. When the team ran analyses on their red blood cells and their telomeres \u2013 a piece of DNA that shortens with stress and age \u2013 they were more eroded and shorter than their counterparts\u2019. The effects continued even after the chicks were no longer exposed to noise pollution, and carried over into their reproductive age four years later. The birds disturbed by noise during the early stages of their lives produced fewer than half as many offspring as their counterparts. \u201cWe were expecting some effects, but we didn\u2019t expect them to be so strong,\u201d said Mariette, especially because the exposure to noise pollution was relatively mild and for only four hours a day. \u201cIt was really quite striking.\u201d \u201cWe generally assume, based on numerous studies, that very young birds, especially in the egg, have very poor or no sensitivity to sound,\u201d said Robert Dooling, an animal hearing expert from the University of Maryland in the US, who was not involved in the study. But \u201cthis study raises the spectre of broad, negative, enduring effects of noise on development\u201d. Hans Slabbekoorn, a professor of acoustic ecology and behaviour at Leiden University in the Netherlands who was not involved in the study, said he was particularly surprised. When his team ran experiments exposing chicks and their parents to moderate noise pollution, they did not find any impact on the growth of the chicks. Slabbekoorn speculated that changes in the behaviour of the parents \u2013 such as how they attended to their nests more \u2013 may have avoided or compensated for the negative effects of noise on the chicks. \u201cI was indeed not expecting [such a] big impact necessarily,\u201d Slabbekoorn said. It is the cumulative nature of these negative effects that may \u201cin the end be most problematic\u201d, he added. \u201cEspecially when noisy conditions are indeed frequent or continuous, as with birds living in noisy neighbourhoods, close to airports, or busy highways.\u201d His research has also found that birds at airports are exposed to such loud noise levels that they may be partially deaf. More data is needed to pinpoint how many birds and which species these levels apply to, and it remains unclear whether it is the loudness, the pattern, the pitch, or other elements of traffic noise that disturb the young birds, or the mechanism behind the observed effects."

            "date": "2024-04-18T16:10:35Z",
            "content": "Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine is stoking geopolitical tensions and damaging the recovery prospects of the global economy, the head of the International Monetary Fund has warned. Kristalina Georgieva urged an end to the two-year conflict, saying it was both a human tragedy and a barrier to growth. As G7 finance ministers said they were looking at ways of using the almost $300bn (\u00a3240bn) of seized Russian assets to help Ukraine, the IMF managing director said support for Kyiv remained \u201csteady and firm\u201d. Georgieva said Ukraine would need $42bn of financial support this year. The G7 group of leading developed countries said it would \u201ccontinue working on all possible avenues by which immobilised Russian sovereign assets could be made use of to support Ukraine, consistent with international law and our respective legal systems\u201d. The communique released after the meeting in Washington also hinted at tougher sanctions against Iran following last weekend\u2019s missile and drone attack on Israel. \u201cWe will ensure close coordination of any future measure to diminish Iran\u2019s ability to acquire, produce, or transfer weapons to support its destabilising regional activities,\u201d the G7 said. Most of the seized Russian assets are being held in Europe, and the European Central Bank is concerned that outright seizure would result in tit-for-tat retaliation from Moscow and may contravene international law. One idea being pursued is to pull forward the interest payments on frozen Russian assets \u2013 estimated at between \u20ac3bn to \u20ac5bn (\u00a32.6bn to \u00a34.3bn) a year \u2013 so that they can be used as collateral for loans or bonds to support Ukraine. The UK chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the G7 had reluctantly concluded that the war in Ukraine was not going to end any time soon and would require a longer term commitment. Georgieva said the sooner the conflicts in Ukraine and in Gaza ended the better it would be for the global economy. \u201cThe war in Ukraine is a tragedy for its people. Having men, women and children killed and wounded is a daily occurrence. We need to end this war for their sake and for the sake of the world economy,\u201d she said. Six months of fighting between Israel and Hamas had meant Gaza\u2019s economy had been \u201cwiped out\u201d, Georgieva said. \u201cEighty per cent of it is gone. The West Bank has also been impacted.\u201d Speaking at a press conference at the IMF\u2019s spring meeting, Georgieva said: \u201cThe world has grappled with multiple shocks \u2013 the pandemic, a cost of living crisis, war and conflict, and climate disasters. The twenties has already been a turbulent decade.\u201d Countries had acted to mitigate the impact of the shocks of the past four years, but it was now time to rebuild buffers, the IMF chief said. \u201cFiscal restraint is becoming more important. Countries must rebuild their fiscal resilience to be ready for the next shock.\u201d The IMF\u2019s world economic outlook released this week showed the US economy was on course to grow more than three times as rapidly as the eurozone this year \u2013 2.7% increase in gross domestic product against 0.8%. Georgieva said there were three factors that explained the disparity. First, the US was better at harnessing innovation so that new ideas could be turned into successful businesses. There was still \u201cwork to be done\u201d to unleash innovation in Europe, Georgieva said, citing the costs of patents in Europe compared with in the US. Second, migration. While the record number of people coming into the US across its southern borders has become a big political issue, Georgieva said its economy was benefitting from \u201cabundant\u201d labour coming into the country. \u201cIt creates a domestic political problem, and not everyone who crosses the border adds positively to the economy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that labour supply also gives to the US another comparative advantage; wages are not pushing up, because there is no strong pressure because of a lack of labour on wage growth.\u201d Third, was that the US had benefitted from more favourable energy prices than Europe, where natural gas prices soared after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Georgieva said."

            "title": "UK rent rises forecast to outpace wage growth for three years",
            "date": "2024-04-07T23:01:17Z",
            "content": "Rent rises in Britain are forecast to outpace wage growth, despite having already surged at the fastest pace on record after the Covid pandemic and the cost of living crisis. The Resolution Foundation expects added pressure on millions of households and said average rents could increase by 13% over the next three years as current high growth in the private rental market work their way through existing tenancies. Forecasting 4.2% growth in average rents in each year up to 2027, the thinktank said this rate was much faster than the 7.5% growth in average workers\u2019 earnings (2.4% a year on average) predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility over that period. Rishi Sunak\u2019s government last month watered down reforms to increase protections for renters against no-fault evictions, leading to accusations that the prime minister and the housing secretary, Michael Gove, had caved in to Tory MPs lobbying in favour of landlords\u2019 interests. In a report titled Through the Roof, the Resolution Foundation said renters across the country had already been through an exceptional surge in new tenancy rent levels \u2013 up by almost a fifth over the past two years. It said the surge had affected more households in the past after a big increase in private renting, almost doubling from 11% of all households in the mid-1990s to 20%. This included a sharp increase in the number of families living in private rented accommodation headed by someone aged 30-49, meaning that renting was no longer solely the preserve of those in their 20s. However, the report said record growth in rental costs was beginning to slow after a \u201cbounceback from the pandemic\u201d, with market rents for new tenancies having cooled from an annual growth rate in cost of 10.4% in June 2023 to 7.5% by March 2024. But the thinktank warned that it could still take years for this burst of growth to work through the whole private rental sector. While new renters were already paying higher monthly outgoings, it said existing tenants reaching the end of their tenancies, or those being forced to accept within-tenancy price rises, would face large rent increases in future. The report found that the main factor driving up rental costs was the snapback from Covid lockdowns, when evictions and repossessions were halted and rents collapsed amid heightened economic uncertainty. More recently, it said fast-rising wages had also pushed up rents for new tenancies. It said there had been \u201cscare stories\u201d about higher interest rate rises and tougher regulations, causing a mass exodus of landlords from the private rental sector. However, it dismissed this as having only a limited impact, highlighting Bank of England research showing the sector had only shrank by 1% since mid-2019. The thinktank said rents tended to track wage levels over the longer term but had fallen to the lowest level on record relative to earnings amid the disruption of the pandemic. While they had risen back by early 2022, they still remained about 5% lower, indicating that they would continue to increase by 13% over the next three years to return the UK\u2019s rent-to-earnings ratio to its long-term trend. Cara Pacitti, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cWith more families renting privately, and renting for longer too, these rent surges are a bigger problem for Britain, and require bolder solutions from policymakers. \u201cShort-term solutions include regular uprating of local housing allowance to support poorer families, and the ultimate, longer-term solution is to simply build more homes.\u201d A government spokesperson said it was supporting households with help for bills amid the cost of living crisis. \u201cOur Renters (Reform) Bill will give people more security in their homes and empower them to challenge poor practices. Through our long term plan for housing we are investing \u00a311.5bn in the affordable homes programme and remain on track to build one million over this parliament.\u201d"

            "content": "The Guardian is right to identify the global sovereign debt crisis as one of the most critical impediments to sustainable development today (Editorial,16 April). Debt relief is urgently needed, but we must also learn the lessons of history. The historic Jubilee 2000 debt relief campaign saw $130bn of debt written off, and yet we now find ourselves in a renewed global debt crisis. This time, action must address the cyclical nature of debt crises. That countries such as Ghana and Sri Lanka are accepting their 17th IMF bailout packages since independence is a stark illustration of how ineffective existing strategies are at breaking the cycle. Bailout packages often come with harsh stipulations, such as budget cuts, that stifle development, worsen living conditions, and leave economies vulnerable to future debt crises. While the IMF chief, Kristalina Georgieva, noted the urgency of debt action ahead of the Spring Meetings, she continued to prescribe budget cuts as a tool to stabilise debt, despite evidence that spending decreases have little effect on debt reduction. In contrast, legislative reform and democratising global financial institutions offer long-term solutions. Legislation to prevent private creditors from suing debtor countries for more than they would receive if they took part in debt-relief initiatives on equal terms to other lenders would provide immediate relief for countries in crisis and prevent future crises by disincentivising risky lending. The creation of a permanent, representative and transparent global debt workout mechanism within the UN system, and an end to harmful conditionalities on loans that exacerbate poverty, harm the environment and stunt growth, would also transform the global debt architecture. It\u2019s time to break free from the redundant cycle of debt and dependency that hinders so many nations.

            "date": "2024-04-19T15:38:05Z",
            "content": "Nothing appears remarkable about a dish of fresh ravioli made with solein. It looks and tastes the same as normal pasta. But the origins of the proteins which give it its full-bodied flavour are extraordinary: they come from Europe\u2019s first factory dedicated to making human food from electricity and air. The factory\u2019s owner, Solar Foods, has started production at a site in Vantaa, near the Finnish capital of Helsinki, that will be able to produce 160 tonnes of food a year. It follows several years of experimenting at lab scale. Solar Foods has already gained novel food approval for solein in Singapore, and is seeking to introduce its products in the US this autumn, followed by the EU by the end of 2025 \u2013 and the UK too, if the regulator can get through the deluge of cannabis-related products. The factory\u2019s output may be small in terms of the global food industry, but Pasi Vainikka, the Solar Foods co-founder and chief executive, hopes that proving its technology works will be a crucial step in revolutionising what humans eat. Food and agriculture is responsible for about a quarter of all planet-heating carbon emissions. Its share of pollution is likely to grow as other industries shift to using green electricity, and ever-expanding middle-classes demand more meat for their tables. Up to now the focus for some climate campaigners has been to try to persuade people to eat less meat and more plants. Non-farmed proteins such as solein might make that approach more appealing. Solein comes in the form of a yellowish powder made up of single-cell organisms, similar to yeast used in baking or beer-making. The company is hoping for those proteins to be used in meat alternatives, cheese and milkshakes, and as an egg replacement ingredient in noodles, pasta and mayonnaise. The ravioli it served up this week was made with solein replacing egg, with a solein version of cream cheese. The Finnish confectioner Fazer has already sold chocolate bars in Singapore with added solein (which is also a handy source of iron for vegans). A Singaporean restaurant last year created a solein chocolate gelato, replacing dairy milk. Vainikka was researching renewable energy systems at a Finnish research institute in 2014 when he met his co-founder, Juha-Pekka Pitk\u00e4nen, a bioprocesses scientist. Pitk\u00e4nen told him of soil-dwelling microbes that release the energy they need to live from oxidising hydrogen (rather than the glucose used by humans, for instance). Together they built a 200-litre fermenter in a garage near Helsinki, to prove the technology could be used for food, but then went into the wild \u201cfinding new potatoes to grow\u201d. All Vainikka will say on solein\u2019s origins is that they found it somewhere \u201cclose to shore\u201d in the Baltic Sea. Almost all food consumed by humans at the moment ultimately comes from plants, which use energy from the sun for photosynthesis. That process converts carbon dioxide and water into the molecules they need to grow. Solar Foods instead uses the same renewable electricity from the sun to split water apart. It then feeds the hydrogen and oxygen to the microbes in a brewing vessel, plus carbon dioxide captured from the air from the company\u2019s office ventilation system. The claim that the proteins are made out of thin air is \u201cnever more than 95% true\u201d, says Vainnika: 5% of the mixture in the brewing vessel is a solution containing other minerals needed by cells, such as iron, magnesium, calcium and phosphorus. The microbes are then pasteurised (killing them), then dried in a centrifuge and with hot air. That leaves a powder that can be used in food. The process could also use CO2 from, for instance, burning fuels \u2013 although the molecule would end up back in the atmosphere once humans eat the solein and breathe out the carbon again. The real climate benefits from solein come from cutting the vast tracts of land used \u2013 and abused through deforestation on an epic scale \u2013 for animal feed and pasture. Instead, renewed forests could trap carbon. Efficient US farmers get 3.3 tonnes of soya beans from each harvest of a hectare, according to the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization. By contrast, Solar Foods\u2019 pilot factory takes up a fifth of a hectare to produce 160 tonnes a year. \u201cAs we can relieve pressures on agricultural land, they can rewild and return to being climate sinks,\u201d Vainikka says. Other companies are pursuing the same dream. Dozens are using microbes to create animal feed, although they often require sugars or fossil fuel feedstocks. One US rival, Air Protein, has opened a factory in California using similar \u201chydrogenotrophs\u201d \u2013 hydrogen eaters. It has the backing of the food multinational Archer-Daniels-Midland, the British bank Barclays and GV (formerly Google Ventures). The Dutch company Deep Branch, which is making fish food, claims its Proton protein will be 60% less carbon-intensive than conventional proteins. Deep Branch is looking at taking the CO2 produced by the UK biomass power generator Drax. The companies have produced their test products. Now they face the challenge of proving their technology works at scale. Vainikka says that is the key problem for cultured meat, or lab-grown meat. The market value of newly listed companies such as Beyond Meat soared during the coronavirus pandemic bubble, only to come crashing down as sales slumped. The opening of Solar Foods\u2019 first factory will be crucial in persuading investors that the company will not suffer the same fate. With meat protein, which is much more expensive than plants or cellular agriculture, there is simply no competition on price for each kilo. But Solar Foods and rivals could face other problems. Conservative politicians particularly in the US and Italy have identified lab-grown food as a threat to their ranching and farming cultures. Vainikka argues that these fears are misplaced. He wants \u201ccoexistence of new and old\u201d, with artisanal, high-quality farms remaining alongside cell farming that can deliver cheap, bulk foods. He argues it is \u201cthe opportunity of the century for the meat industry\u201d to focus on quality rather than churning out as much cheap (and heavily subsidised) meat as possible. And plant agriculture will also remain, he argues. \u201cThe future is not powder: the main body of food will still come through plants,\u201d he says. The occasional \u201csalami with the cultural heritage, that can remain. The meat in your lasagne during lunch will be done by cellular agriculture.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-11T16:29:12Z",
            "content": "Aircraft could one day take off on fuel made from human waste under plans revealed by Wizz Air and the British sustainable aviation company Firefly to build a commercial refinery in Essex. Firefly, based in Bristol, said it had developed a process to convert treated sewage into sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. The low-cost airline Wizz said it was investing by placing an order \u2013 potentially worth hundreds of millions of pounds \u2013 for up to 525,000 tonnes of Firefly\u2019s waste-based fuel over the next 15 years. Firefly has now signed agreements with industrial partners for a pilot refinery in Harwich that would take \u201cbiosolids\u201d from Anglian Water and turn it into aircraft fuel. Airlines will have to ensure that a minimum proportion of fuel burned is certified sustainable in the coming decade, with the EU mandating at least 20% SAF by 2035, and the UK expected soon to announce a mandatory 10% by 2030. There are various ways of making SAF but most are much more expensive than normal kerosene jet fuel, with a limited supply of waste feedstocks such as used cooking oil. Firefly\u2019s chief operations officer, Paul Hilditch, said converted sewage should be cheaper and more abundant, providing up to 5% of airlines\u2019 fuel needs in the UK. The process uses biosolids, the water industry term for the final product in the treatment process. \u201cIt\u2019s crumbly \u2013 like compost or wet chocolate cake,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s millions of tonnes of the stuff. And it has no intrinsic value.\u201d The company has produced small test quantities of SAF that he said were \u201cchemically indistinguishable\u201d from jet fuel, with a residue that can be used as a soil enhancer. The fuel is still in a regulatory testing process, and Firefly is still to secure the investment it needs to build a full-scale factory. However, its chief executive, James Hygate, said it was confident it could be delivering commercial supplies of SAF by 2028-29. He said the first facility in Harwich would serve London airports and there was potential for two more in the UK. \u201cWe\u2019re turning sewage into jet fuel and I can\u2019t think of many things that are cooler than that,\u201d he commented. Wizz Air\u2019s corporate and ESG officer, Yvonne Moynihan, said: \u201cAlongside fleet renewal and operational efficiency, SAF plays a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions from aviation.\u201d She said Wizz\u2019s investment in Firefly was a \u201cperfect pair-up for a low-cost airline\u201d and the carrier aspired to use 10% SAF across its entire operation by 2030, although it would need \u201ca significant ramp-up of production and deployment\u201d. The UK government has said it expects five commercial plants to produce SAF in the UK to be under construction by 2025. However, campaigners have said even using human waste for aviation was not truly sustainable. Matt Finch, of the thinktank Transport &amp; Environment UK, said sewage could also be used to make biomethane and there was direct competition for its use: \u201cWhat\u2019s the best use of this biomass hasn\u2019t been clarified \u2026 It\u2019s another conundrum.\u201d About 87% of UK water companies\u2019 biosolids are currently spread on farmland. Cait Hewitt, of the Aviation Environment Foundation, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not to be sniffed at, given that this is truly unavoidable waste, but not great either given it\u2019s already in use as fertiliser.\u201d She said any test for the carbon credentials of alternative fuels should ask: \u201cHas the producer done something to draw down additional CO2 from the atmosphere? Otherwise it\u2019s nothing near a net zero solution.\u201d Hilditch said the use of biosolids for muckspreading on farms was of low value, and the residue from the sewage-to-fuel process would still be available to improve soil. Many other countries simply incinerated human waste, meaning that converting it to jet fuel could also have other benefits in terms of efficient disposal, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the UK of course. Anywhere in the world where there are people, there\u2019s poo.\u201d"

The way advertising is bought and sold has changed a lot since the first edition of the Guardian was published over 200 years ago, with the majority of advertising now served online. Beyond advertising, the ways in which journalism is funded are also changing. The Guardian is a wholly independent media organisation \u2013 we don\u2019t get money from a billionaire or state backing our business. In fact, over half of the money needed to fund our journalism now comes directly from readers, with a quarter still coming from advertising. And with the ongoing challenges the world is facing, and the pressures on news business models, this advertising money remains crucial to funding hundreds of journalists so that we can deliver quality, independent reporting to readers across the globe without a paywall. We take a responsible approach to advertising. We were the first major media outlet to ban advertising from fossil fuel extraction businesses, and more recently decided to stop taking advertising from gambling companies.

            "date": "2024-04-05T15:46:37Z",
            "content": "Scottish ministers have given emergency funding to save a network of Gaelic community workers who faced being laid off because of government cuts. Gaelic activists, MSPs and community leaders were dismayed after it emerged last month that B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig (BnG), the body charged with protecting Gaelic, was removing 27 development worker posts across the country. They said losing these posts would deepen the crisis affecting Gaelic language and culture, which has been in long-term retreat. Activists said Gaelic could be \u201cdead in its heartlands by 2030\u201d. BnG was adamant the cuts were necessary because the Scottish government had stopped providing dedicated funding for the programme; it said its core grant had barely grown since it was set up 17 years ago, making it impossible to find the money needed to support the 27 posts. The Scottish government initially defended the cuts and told BnG it had to take responsibility for finding ways to protect the programme. But in a significant change, the government announced on Friday it had found \u00a3175,000 to fund it in the short term. Humza Yousaf, the first minister, speaking as he visited the Western Isles, where Gaelic was once dominant, said: \u201cWe recognise the significant part Gaelic plays in Scotland\u2019s culture and we want to support the language to grow and thrive. \u201cDespite the extraordinary financial challenges facing the Scottish government, B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig\u2019s core baseline funding has been protected and we are bringing forward the Scottish languages bill to provide further protection for Scotland\u2019s Indigenous languages.\u201d Yousaf said BnG now had to find ways to protect the programme in the long term. Ealasaid MacDonald, BnG\u2019s chief executive, said the government\u2019s \u201cactive partnership\u201d in the scheme was welcome and said it had been in touch with the communities and organisations affected to let them know. \u201cWe will continue to work together to ensure that the scheme contributes to building the capacity for Gaelic across our communities,\u201d she said. \u201cThe work of these officers enables opportunities for empowering communities as they determine what they need to allow Gaelic to prosper.\u201d The original cuts announcement had angered Gaelic groups, which said the development officer posts were central to their plans to open new Gaelic hubs and promote the language in areas such as Tiree, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. In Aberdeen, the cuts amplified a controversy around the university\u2019s decision to heavily reduce its Gaelic teaching as part of cuts to its modern languages department. Activists said the university had backtracked on an understanding it would help fund its Gaelic development officer because of the severity of its budgetary problems; the university denied that, and said there was no indication it was required to fund the post once BnG funding ended. Rhoda Meek, the chair of Tiree Development Trust on the Hebridean island of Tiree, said the emergency funding was welcome. But she added: \u201cWe remain disappointed that this critical work is funded by top-ups and would appeal to both the government and B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig to rethink the importance they place on Gaelic in our vernacular communities.\u201d Prof Wilson McLeod, an emeritus professor of Gaelic at Edinburgh University involved in a setting up a new Gaelic hub in Edinburgh, said the bailout was \u201cexcellent news\u201d and would be a relief for everyone affected. For some community projects, he said \u201cthe money is running out right now, so this is a lifeline\u201d. Nonetheless, there were still significant questions about how these posts and programmes would be secured in the longer term. \u201cIt appears to be a bit of an interim solution and I think there will be questions going forward,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2024-04-22T04:00:14Z",
            "content": "A plan due to be published today to improve the accountability and transparency of Unrwa, the UN relief works agency for Palestinians, is not expected to lead to a snap British decision to restore funding to the agency. Britain joined 18 other nations in suspending funding for the agency after Israel claimed that 12 of the 30,000 Unrwa staff had participated in the attack on Israel on 7 October. Almost all those countries have restored funding, and the UK government is facing conflicting domestic pressures over whether to do the same. The UK provided \u00a335m last financial year to Unrwa, including \u00a316m extra for humanitarian aid. Some Conservative MPs and strong supporters of Israel have written to the foreign secretary, Lord Cameron, to warn that it would be a form of moral bankruptcy to resume funding, since they regard the agency as being too close to Hamas. The former home secretary Suella Braverman claimed: \u201cUnwra has been categorically discredited. Hamas has taken over elements of Unrwa and used them for terrorist attacks. For the UK government to divert British taxpayers\u2019 money to fund Unrwa\u2019s activities would be a disgrace. This must not happen.\u201d They claim the task of food distribution can be undertaken by other agencies such as the World Food Programme, but others say Unrwa has an infrastructure that no other agency can replace. The independent report prepared by the former French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, and commissioned by the UN is due to be published at noon in New York (5pm BST) after being handed to the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, at the weekend. The report, described as concise and direct, contains a set of recommendations to make the organisation more transparent and accountable. Unrwa has already committed to providing donor countries with full lists of its employees every quarter including, for the first time, their ID card identification. Among those to have restored funding are the EU, Canada, Australia, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Germany, France and Japan. Germany has not yet resumed funding Unrwa\u2019s Gaza operations, but it has done so for those in Jordan, Lebanon and the West Bank. It is possible the UK will take a decision to restore funding soon. The deputy foreign minister, Andrew Mitchell, has previously said he sees no alternative agency capable of carrying out the range of Unrwa\u2019s tasks. The US Congress has voted to direct the Biden administration not to restore funding to Unrwa until at least March next year. The US is Unrwa\u2019s largest funder, but other countries have stepped forward with additional support to keep the agency going. In April, Unrwa\u2019s commissioner general, Philippe Lazzarini, called for a separate independent investigation into how the protected status of humanitarian workers and facilities had been blatantly disregarded in Gaza. He claimed Unrwa was facing a campaign to push it out of the occupied Palestinian territory. He told the UN security council: \u201cIn Gaza, the government of Israel seeks to end Unrwa\u2019s activities. The agency\u2019s requests to deliver aid to the north are repeatedly denied. Our staff are barred from coordination meetings between Israel and humanitarian actors. \u201cWorse, Unrwa premises and staff have been targeted since the beginning of the war.\u201d He warned that dismantling Unrwa would \u201chave lasting repercussions. In the short term, it will deepen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and accelerate the onset of famine. In the longer-term, it will jeopardise the transition from ceasefire to \u2018day after\u2019 by depriving a traumatised population of essential services. \u201cIt will make nearly impossible the formidable task of bringing half a million deeply distressed girls and boys back to learning.\u201d UN Watch, the NGO long opposed to Unrwa\u2019s role, has already accused the Colonna report of being a tainted whitewash. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 April 2024 because Catherine Colonna is a former French foreign minister, not the current minister as an earlier version said."

The general staff did not provide additional details. Russian attacks killed at least three people in different regions of eastern Ukraine, local officials said on Sunday, and two more in Lviv region, far from the frontlines. In the centre of the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, a frequent target of Russia\u2019s attacks on energy and other infrastructure, a strike hit civilian targets in the evening, said the regional governor, Oleh Synehubov. Regional news outlets said bombs were dropped on different areas of the region. No injuries were reported. Earlier on Sunday, heavy shelling killed a man in the town of Borova, south-east of Kharkiv, local prosecutors said. Police in the Donetsk region, in Ukraine\u2019s south-east, said Russian shelling hit 14 towns and villages, with two dead reported in Krasnohorivka, west of the Russian-held regional centre of Donetsk. Russian attacks on infrastructure extended well behind the frontlines. The Lviv regional governor, Maksym Kozitskyi, said two bodies were pulled from rubble after cruise missile strikes. Russian forces bombed the border territories and settlements of the Sumy region 39 times on Sunday, the Ukrainian local regional military administration said. There were 157 explosions recorded from ordnance including artillery shells, mortars, exploding drones, drone-dropped mines and grenades, and rockets fired from helicopters. Sumy has been pounded by Russian attacks in recent weeks, forcing evacuations. Over the border in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region, the regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said a woman was killed when a border village came under attack. The accounts of military action from either side were not independently confirmed. \u201cOur spirit does not give up,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an Easter message. \u201cThere is no night or day when Russian terror does not try to break our lives,\u201d Zelenskiy wrote to Ukrainians on social media, following Russian missile strikes. Zelenskiy was in Bucha on Sunday alongside the prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, and several foreign ambassadors to mark two years since the city and surrounding areas\u2019 were liberated from a brutal month-long occupation by Russia at the start of the war. The Ukrainian leader laid a lamp at the town\u2019s wall of remembrance, which names the 509 civilians who have so far been identified of those killed during Bucha\u2019s occupation. France will deliver hundreds of old armoured vehicles and new surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine. The French defence minister, Sebastien Lecornu, told a French newspaper that the president, Emmanuel Macron, had asked him to prepare a new aid package, which will include old but still functional equipment, as well as new missiles. Protesters in Kyiv have demonstrated for the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war from the Azov brigade. Relatives and friends of captured soldiers, some dressed in military clothing, waved placards at passing traffic."

            "date": "2024-04-16T16:49:18Z",
            "content": "With Ukrainian officials warning the country lacks the arms to defend itself as Russia pushes its offensive, the US Congress has finally announced plans to bring a package on military aid for Ukraine \u2013 which has stalled for months due to Republican scepticism \u2013 to a vote in the House of Representatives. What is the new US plan to help Ukraine? The Republican speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, has proposed to split the $95bn aid bill that was originally passed by the Senate in a bipartisan vote in February (including $60bn for Ukraine, $14bn for Israel and $5bn for Pacific allies including Taiwan) into four separate bills. Each of these would go to an individual vote. One of the bills would focus on Ukraine (with most of the funding going towards replenishing American munitions), one on Israel, one on Taiwan and Indo-Pacific allies and the fourth on a kind of grab-bag of foreign policy priorities, including banning TikTok in the US, imposing sanctions on Iran and making aid to Ukraine a loan rather than a straight gift. The details of the four bills have not yet been officially released. But essentially Johnson is proposing to unlink aid for Ukraine \u2013 which many Republicans oppose, causing it to languish in the House for months \u2013 from aid for Israel, which is more popular with many lawmakers after Iran\u2019s attack on Israel at the weekend. Controversially, humanitarian aid for Gaza \u2013 for which $9bn was allocated in the original Senate bill \u2013 may not be included in any of the bills, although it could yet be added (and Democrats insist that bit is non-negotiable). Nor is there any provision for US-Mexico border security, the absence of which Johnson spent months claiming was one of the main reasons he wasn\u2019t bringing the Senate bill to a floor vote in the House. What are its chances of success? Each bill would need to pass its own vote, which on the face of it could be difficult. Republicans have only a two-seat majority in the House, and Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene immediately denounced the bill as a \u201csham\u201d. Johnson\u2019s plan received some initial support from other hard-right Republicans, but several of them then expressed scepticism about the speaker\u2019s plan to bundle the bills together when they are sent to the Senate. \u201cIsrael funding should not be held hostage by Ukraine funding,\u201d congressman Andy Biggs, a Republican of Arizona, said on X. \u201cThe American people deserve to know where their senators stand on each funding component.\u201d Many Republicans will also want to be allowed to make amendments to the bill. But Democrats may join Republicans in support of procedural movements and some of the bills themselves. Once the text is released, House rules require at least three days before a bill goes to a vote \u2013 and with the House taking another week-long break on Thursday, that means it could take several weeks before any results. Then, each bill that is passed by the House would need to go back to the Senate for (re)approval, with no guarantee it would survive. But Johnson seems to feel he had no choice. Many far-right Republican members oppose Ukraine aid, with some members threatening to torpedo Johnson\u2019s leadership should he bring the original Senate bill to a vote in the House. He reportedly told Joe Biden in a phone call that, although a much more complicated plan with myriad potential obstacles facing each bill, splitting the aid bill into four individual ones was the only solution. \u201cIf I do the same thing as the Senate bill, I know we can\u2019t process it,\u201d Johnson told Biden, according to Politico. \u201cThis is the only way forward.\u201d What is the current situation on the battlefield in Ukraine? With western aid stalling and Russia on the offensive across multiple fronts, Ukraine is nearing its most perilous period since it first repelled Moscow\u2019s full-scale assault in February 2022, stunning the world. For months, Ukraine has grappled with three pressing challenges: insufficient ammunition, a scarcity of experienced troops amid mounting casualties, and dwindling air defence missiles. The eastern Ukrainian Donetsk region has been the focal point of Russia\u2019s slow advance, with Russian forces currently aiming to capture the strategically important town of Chasiv Yar. \u201cThe situation on the eastern front has significantly worsened in recent days,\u201d the Ukrainian commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrsky, wrote on Telegram, after a visit to the eastern Donetsk region on Saturday. Syrsky said Russia was hoping to capture Chasiv Yar by 9 May, when Moscow celebrates its victory over Nazi Germany. What are the other schemes to arm and fund Ukraine? In addition to military and financial assistance from European Nato allies \u2013 including Germany, France and the UK \u2013 and others, the Czech Republic is leading a multinational initiative to buy hundreds of thousands of artillery ammunition rounds for Ukraine. The Czechs, through a team of government officials and private companies, have vowed to deliver Ukraine critical ammunition rounds from countries around the world, with first deliveries to Kyiv expected by June. The Czech plan, which has received support from about 20 countries, is meant to solve Ukraine\u2019s dramatic lack of ammunition at a time when Moscow is \u2018\u2018outshelling\u2019\u2019 Kyiv by a five-to-one ratio. The innovative scheme works by European countries buying the shells from countries in Africa and Asia, such as South Korea, which are unwilling to supply them directly to Ukraine but happy to sell to a third party such as the Czech Republic. On Monday, the Czech prime minister said his country had already contracted the first 180,000 rounds of ammunition and was working to secure a further 300,000 rounds. The plan is seen as a temporary measure to fill Ukraine\u2019s ammunition gap, until Europe can produce enough ammunition on its own. The EU has previously admitted that it expected to meet only 52% of a target set last year to deliver a million shells by March. How is Nato planning to help? Earlier this month, Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, proposed an unprecedented five-year, 100bn euro package of military aid to Ukraine. The initiative aims to alleviate future uncertainty over US military aid to Ukraine by shifting more responsibility to the Nato bloc in coordinating arms support for Kyiv. Currently, most Nato members provide weapons to Ukraine on a bilateral basis, while the bloc has restricted itself to sending non-lethal aid for Ukraine out of fears that a more direct role could lead to an escalation with Russia. Experts and diplomats have cautioned that Stoltenberg\u2019s plan is at a very early stage and it is unclear whether the 100bn total would be accepted or how it would be financed. The secretary-general\u2019s plan would upend Nato\u2019s current role and would require consensus among the alliance\u2019s 32 members. Hungary, the most pro-Russian Nato country, has already voiced opposition to the plan. How would the US\u2019s $60bn aid package help Ukraine? Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has previously warned that his country \u201cwill lose the war\u201d if the US Congress fails to approve military aid, indicating the critical importance Kyiv places on the stalled military assistance package. While US Republican critics of the aid package have voiced anger over what they perceive as excessive assistance to Ukraine, a significant portion of the funds allocated to Kyiv will remain within the US. Of the $60.7bn for Ukraine, about $20bn would be used by the US to replenish its military stockpiles previously depleted by the push to arm Ukraine. This could open the door for future US military transfers to Ukraine. Another $14bn will be allocated to the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, a special program in which the Pentagon buys new weapons for the Ukrainian military directly from US defence contractors. The US president, Joe Biden, has stressed that the Ukrainian aid bill would boost the US economy, telling voters that almost two-thirds \u2013 or nearly $40bn \u2013 of the money for Ukraine would actually go to US factories spread across the country. A third chunk of the funds, roughly $15bn, will be spent on enhancing the capabilities of the Ukrainian military, fostering intelligence collaboration between Kyiv and Washington and bolstering the US presence in eastern Europe. The support also includes nonmilitary assistance, with about $8bn likely going to help Ukraine\u2019s government continue basic operations, including the payment of salaries and pensions. The US has so far sent Ukraine roughly $111bn in weapons, equipment, humanitarian assistance and other aid since the start of the war more than two years ago."

            "content": "Senators in Liberia have voted overwhelmingly to establish a war crimes court, two decades after civil conflict ended in the west African country. The new court will investigate and try crimes against humanity and corruption committed during Liberia\u2019s two civil wars between 1989 and 2003, which killed up to 250,000 people. Peterson Sonyah, the executive director of the Liberia Massacre Survivors Association, said: \u201cThis is what we have been advocating for over the years. Establishing the court will help justice in Liberia and will also address the culture of impunity which has become widespread in Liberia. \u201cWith this court, Liberia can move ahead better and ensure people who committed crimes against humanity are held accountable.\u201d No one has been tried in Liberia for crimes committed during its two civil wars, the first of which ran from 1989-97 and the second from 1999-2003. Former rebel commanders Alieu Kosiah and Kunti Kamara have been tried and convicted for war crimes in Switzerland and France, respectively. Another former commander, Martina Johnson, is awaiting trial in Belgium. The former Liberian president Charles Taylor was sentenced to 50 years in prison for crimes committed in neighbouring Sierra Leone after a hearing at a special court at The Hague. His son, Charles \u201cChuckie\u201d Taylor Jr, was tried in the US and sentenced to 97 years in jail for torture during Liberia\u2019s civil war. Civil society has been calling for the creation of a court since the end of the war, when thousands of people were mutilated and children were recruited as soldiers and sex slaves. Liberia\u2019s truth and reconciliation commission recommended a court be established in 2009, but there was little political appetite to move forward until President Joseph Boakai promised to explore the possibilities during his inauguration in January this year. Senators voted 27 out of 29 in favour of the court last week, after the resolution was backed by MPs in the lower house in March. Boakai still has to give his final approval and will need to ask the international community for money to fund the new court."

            "date": "2024-04-19T16:22:46Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak\u2019s big speech on reforming disability benefits was intended to show that the government had a grip on the economic and health challenges of the UK\u2019s rising levels of long-term sickness. Instead, it came over as an administration running out of ideas, high on strident rhetoric, and desperate to cut welfare bills at all costs. It was a \u201cmoral mission\u201d, Sunak declared, to overhaul the current welfare system, which was \u201cunfit for purpose\u201d. Disability benefits were too easy to cheat, too cushy, too easily claimed. The speech was a clear appeal to the notion, in vogue on the right, that \u201cmental health culture\u201d has \u201cgone too far\u201d. \u201cSicknote culture\u201d \u2013 the idea that millions of lazy Britons are taking sickies with the connivance of GPs \u2013 was also in his sights, although there was little evidence to backup his assertion, or explanation as to how the changes would work. The underlying message was clear: claimants are lazy and the system too generous. The most significant announcement was the proposed redesign of the main disability benefit personal independence payment (Pip). Ministers are convinced that far too many people \u2013 especially those with mental illness \u2013 are able to claim Pip, a non-means-tested payment designed to help claimants with the extra costs of daily living. It is likely to focus on narrowing eligibility to drive down the Pip bill so that fewer awards are made, and at lower rates. Sceptics will point out that his was tried a decade ago, when Pip was introduced in place of disability living allowance. That reform \u2013 at the time brutally controversial, and incompetently managed \u2013 has clearly failed, even on its own terms. Sunak sugared the pill of cuts with pious platitudes. He was \u201cgiving back hope\u201d to people who had lost all \u201cdignity and meaning\u201d when they became entrapped in the vortex of the welfare state, he said. It was a familiar Tory tune \u2013 the idea that millions of people are not so much ill as spiritually lost. Sunak floated other under-explained ideas: long-term unemployed claimants who refuse to take any job offered to them would have their benefits withdrawn; mentally ill claimants would be offered medical treatment as an alternative to cash benefits. But these felt like fodder for culture warfare rather than serious proposals. The reaction was fierce. The disability charity Scope called it a \u201cfull-on assault on disabled people\u201d. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation described the speech as \u201can irresponsible war of words on people who already aren\u2019t getting enough support\u201d. The Resolution Foundation said it was \u201ca problem statement, not a plan\u201d. Labour\u2019s acting shadow welfare minister, Alison McGovern, promised to reduce NHS waiting lists, reform social security and make work pay, but she was not clear precisely how Labour would do this. What is certain is that the challenge of long-term sickness \u2013 and the impact on the labour market \u2013 will be a priority for the next government. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimates that one in 10 working-age Britons are receiving health-related benefits, and this is expected to increase. New monthly claims have doubled since the pandemic, especially among young people: a 20-year-old today is about as likely to claim a health-related benefit as a 39-year-old was in 2019. A Labour government would need to balance restraining the benefits bill while addressing wider reasons behind mental illness such as poverty, insecure work, ineffectual job support and inadequate NHS care. It does not help \u2013 as the IFS said \u2013 that no one can yet fully explain what is driving the recent explosion in the takeup of health and disability benefits."

            "date": "2024-04-21T17:18:10Z",
            "content": "After the US House of Representatives on Saturday approved a $61bn aid package for Ukraine, Dan Sabbagh looks at what it could mean for the country\u2019s war against Russia. What difference could more US weapons make to Ukraine? Ukraine has been struggling against Russian aggression since US military aid essentially dried up at the end of last year, suffering in particular from an increasingly serious shortage of artillery. Its military was forced to abandon the Donbas town of Avdiivka in February and is now coming under pressure in Chasiv Yar. Moscow\u2019s forces have been able to outshell Kyiv by a ratio of at least five to one, rising to 10 to 1, meaning that Ukrainian artillery have been increasingly unable to prevent Russian forces from massing in advance of ground attacks. The shortages were so acute that some Ukrainian gunners reported they were reduced to firing smoke shells to scare the Russians because they had no shells left. At the same time, Ukraine has been short of air and missile defences, exposing its civilians to increased danger. Russia switched to aggressively targeting Ukrainian power stations, knocking out two in Kharkiv region in March and another south of Kyiv earlier in April. Electricity is rationed to a few hours a day in Kharkiv, a city of 1.3 million people, and there is growing anxiety that the power system may be unable to cope, particularly next autumn and winter. When will US weapons start arriving on the battlefield? Pentagon officials indicated on Friday that they were preparing an initial package for the White House to approve for sending to Ukraine within days after the Senate ratifies the vote by the House of Representatives and President Joe Biden signs it into law. A Senate vote is expected on Tuesday and the initial package, probably with artillery and air defence at its heart, could come soon after that. Some munitions have been stockpiled in Europe in anticipation, and could be on the move in a week or two. However, experts cautioned that it would take some time before any difference was felt. Ben Hodges, a former commander of the US army in Europe, said \u201cit may be weeks before we see significant battlefield effects\u201d, while Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, cautioned on Sunday that Russia might try to mount a hurried offensive and launch further air raids in an attempt to press home its advantage on the eastern front. When will Europe\u2019s contribution come through? European countries were slow to reorganise their military-industrial base in support of Ukraine. Unlike in the US, where some munitions, such the manufacture of artillery shells, are handled by government-owned companies, European countries rely on private-sector firms, and issuing contracts took longer than expected. But concern about if and when the US would resupply Ukraine has speeded up activity. A Czech-led initiative to buy more artillery shells from neutral countries with surplus stocks has obtained at least 300,000, the first deliveries of which will come through before June. Germany said it would donate a Patriot air defence system a week ago, while the Netherlands has offered to buy Patriots from countries unwilling to give them to Ukraine directly. What could the medium-term impact be on the war? Russia has also been increasing its defence spending, to up to 7.5% of GDP on some estimates, and innovating on the battlefield. Moscow is increasingly using crude but deadly air-launched glide bombs to devastate the frontline, from distances that Kyiv cannot counter, and Ukrainian soldiers have reported that an increasingly large number of drones are being used against them. Russia also has a manpower advantage on the battlefield, which it has been able to exploit along with heavy weaponry. Experts do not expect Ukraine to turn around the battlefield position in 2024. \u201cThe main point is that this funding can probably only help stabilise the Ukrainian position for this year and begin preparations for operations in 2025,\u201d said Matthew Savill of the Rusi military thinktank, while Hodges argued that 2024 was probably \u201cthe year of industrial competition\u201d, where both sides tried to build up resources in an attempt to strike a decisive blow next year."

            "date": "2024-04-29T16:24:25Z",
            "content": "The US secretary of state has said that \u201cthe only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire\u201d is Hamas, ahead of what are seen as last-chance talks to salvage a diplomatic solution before a threatened Israeli ground invasion in Rafah. Speaking at a World Economic Forum meeting in Saudi Arabia on Monday, Antony Blinken said: \u201cHamas has before it a proposal that is extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel. \u201cThey have to decide and they have to decide quickly \u2026 I\u2019m hopeful that they will make the right decision and we can have a fundamental change in the dynamic.\u201d The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, told the same gathering that Hamas should accept the deal for a \u201csustained 40 days\u2019 ceasefire\u201d. International actors have renewed efforts to broker a ceasefire in the nearly seven-month-old conflict in recent days. Israel\u2019s mounting preparations for a ground operation in Rafah, where more than half of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million population has sought shelter from the fighting elsewhere, mean this week\u2019s talks in Cairo may be the last opportunity for negotiations to free Israeli hostages and pause or end the war. A Hamas delegation left the Egyptian capital on Monday, saying they would return again with a written response to the ceasefire proposal. Blinken, on his seventh visit to the region since the war broke out, is expected to next visit Israel to discuss the negotiations. Israel has not publicly confirmed whether it is also sending a delegation to Cairo. The latest ceasefire proposal appears to include major compromises from Israel, which is under domestic pressure over the fate of the hostages and facing international criticism over the humanitarian crisis its war has caused in Gaza. About 1,200 Israelis were killed and another 250 taken hostage in Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel\u2019s ensuing retaliatory operation in Gaza, which has left desperate civilians without healthcare, food or water and reduced most of the coastal territory to ruins. Israel is reportedly willing to accept the release of just 33 hostages in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails, and a second phase of a truce that includes a \u201cperiod of sustained calm\u201d \u2013 a new response to Hamas\u2019s repeated demand for a permanent ceasefire. It is also reportedly open to discussing the return of Palestinians to their homes in the northern half of the strip, and the withdrawal of troops from the military corridor that now divides the territory. Egypt\u2019s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, said Egypt was optimistic about the new talks. \u201cWe are hopeful the proposal has taken into account the positions of both sides, has tried to extract moderation from both sides, and we are waiting to have a final decision,\u201d he said. A senior Hamas official said on Sunday that the group had no \u201cmajor issues\u201d with the most recent truce plan, which in essence remains the same as the deal outlined in several failed rounds of talks since a week-long ceasefire collapsed at the end of November. In recent days Hamas has broadcast several proof-of-life videos of hostages, a move widely interpreted as a good faith gesture towards mediators. However, an official from the group told Reuters on Monday that \u201cquestions and enquiries\u201d remain, suggesting that a response on the latest proposal may not be immediately forthcoming. Even as hopes grew once again that talks between Israel and Hamas could finally succeed, at least 30 people were killed in airstrikes on Rafah. Strikes that hit three houses in the city next to the Egyptian border on Monday injured many more people, while in Gaza City, the bombing of two buildings killed another four people and wounded several more, medics said. An Israeli military spokesperson said fighter jets had \u201cstruck terror targets where terrorists were operating within a civilian area in southern Gaza\u201d, declining to give details. Israel has said that Hamas\u2019s leadership, along with four battalions of fighters, are camped out in Rafah, using Israeli hostages as human shields, and that a ground operation is necessary to achieve Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s promise of \u201ctotal victory\u201d over the Palestinian militants and bring the remaining hostages home. But the long-threatened plan to attack Rafah has drawn intense opposition from Israel\u2019s allies, including the US, which says the overcrowded conditions could lead to thousands of civilian casualties as well as further disrupting aid deliveries entering from Egypt. Joe Biden \u201creiterated his clear\u201d opposition to an invasion of Rafah in a conversation with Netanyahu on Sunday. Blinken reiterated on Monday that the US would not support an Israeli offensive on Rafah until it had seen a plan to prevent harm to civilians. \u201cWe\u2019ve said clearly, and for some time now on Rafah that, in the absence of a plan to ensure that civilians will not be harmed, we can\u2019t support a major military operation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not yet seen a plan that gives us confidence that civilians can be effectively protected.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s ministers have publicly sparred on whether to go forward with a truce, with far-right members of his coalition threatening to quit the government if Israel is seen to \u201csurrender\u201d to Hamas\u2019s demands. Meanwhile, Israeli officials appeared increasingly concerned that the international criminal court may issue arrest warrants against the country\u2019s leaders, as pressure mounts over the war. Israeli officials have referred in recent days to an ICC investigation launched three years ago into possible war crimes committed by Israel and Palestinian militants going back to the 2014 Israel-Hamas war. The investigation is also looking at Israel\u2019s construction of settlements in occupied territory the Palestinians want for a future state. There was no comment from the court on Monday, and it has given no indication warrants in the case are imminent. It was not clear what sparked the Israeli concerns. Israel\u2019s foreign ministry said late on Sunday that it had informed Israeli missions of \u201crumours\u201d that warrants could be issued against senior political and military officials. The foreign minister, Israel Katz, said any such warrants would \u201cprovide a morale boost\u201d to Hamas and other militant groups. Netanyahu said on Friday that Israel \u201cwill never accept any attempt by the ICC to undermine its inherent right of self-defence\u201d. \u201cThe threat to seize the soldiers and officials of the Middle East\u2019s only democracy and the world\u2019s only Jewish state is outrageous. We will not bow to it,\u201d he posted on X."

            "date": "2024-04-10T17:57:05Z",
            "content": "Three sons and at least two grandchildren of the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, have been killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip, the exiled political chief of the militant group has said from his base in the Qatari capital of Doha. Haniyeh told Al Jazeera on Wednesday that his children Hazem, Amir and Mohammed and several of their children were visiting relatives for Eid at the Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza when their car was targeted in an Israeli airstrike. Sixty of his relatives had been killed in the six-month-old war, he said, including 14 who died after an Israeli airstrike hit the family home in Gaza City in October. The Hamas leader said the attack would not change the group\u2019s demands for a permanent ceasefire and return of displaced Palestinians from their homes in ongoing negotiations mediated by Doha and Washington. \u201cAll our people and all the families of Gaza have paid a heavy price in blood, and I am one of them,\u201d Haniyeh said. The Israeli military statement confirmed it had targeted Haniyeh\u2019s sons, who it described as \u201cthree Hamas operatives\u201d who were \u201con their way to carry out terrorist activities\u201d. The strike came after Joe Biden said the actionsof Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Gaza were a \u201cmistake\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with his approach,\u201d he said. Biden added: \u201cWhat I\u2019m calling for is for the Israelis to just call for a ceasefire, allow for the next six, eight weeks, total access to all food and medicine going into the country.\u201d The US president\u2019s remarks on a ceasefire marked a shift from previous comments, in which he had said the burden lay with Hamas to agree to a truce and hostage release deal. The comments, aired on Tuesday by the US Spanish-language TV network Univision, were made last week, a day before a tense phone call between the two leaders in which Biden sought answers from Netanyahu about the drone strike that killed seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen, and extracted promises that Israel would do more to protect civilians and allow more desperately needed aid into Gaza. Washington would be forced to change policy if Israel did not change its conduct in the Palestinian territory, he reportedly said. Israel responded by agreeing to open new aid crossings: 419 trucks entered Gaza on Monday, a record number for a single day since the war began. Biden has provided strong diplomatic and military support to the US\u2019s major Middle Eastern ally since the 7 October Hamas attack in which Israeli officials say 1,200 people were killed and another 250 taken hostage. However, growing domestic and international pressure over the humanitarian catastrophe in the besieged strip has forced his administration to belatedly shift its stance. The most serious disagreement has been over Israel\u2019s plans for a ground offensive in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah, where more than a million people have sought relative safety. Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed that Israel will carry out the operation. After six months of war, more than 33,400 people have been killed in the coastal territory, according to the local health ministry, and nearly all of the 2.3 million population displaced from their homes. Famine is \u201cprojected and imminent\u201d in some areas, a UN-backed report said last month. World Central Kitchen was expected to resume aid shipments to Gaza soon, Cypriot officials said on Wednesday, after the humanitarian programme was suspended after Israel\u2019s killing of a convoy of aid workers who had coordinated their movements with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on 1 April. About 1,000 tons of aid, mostly food, is waiting to be loaded in Larnaca. Israel announced on Sunday it had pulled all of its ground troops out of southern Gaza for \u201ctactical reasons\u201d, raising questions about the future direction of the war as hopes grew that the latest round of ceasefire negotiations in Cairo may finally bear fruit. But on Wednesday ground battles raged in several areas of the strip, killing at least 127 people, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said, and truce talks appeared to once again falter. The sides remain far apart on key issues, including the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza. Netanyahu\u2019s security cabinet met late on Tuesday to discuss the hostage negotiations but did not appear to make any decisions. Also on Wednesday, the Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz told members of his National Unity party that \u201cvictory will come step by step\u201d, warned that Israel was facing a long war and that it would have to fight in Gaza for years to come. Hamas seized power after a brief civil war with the rival faction Fatah in 2007, leading Israel to blockade the territory, fighting four wars and dozens of smaller conflagrations before 7 October upended the status quo in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The war in Gaza has sparked fears of a regional conflict, heightened last week by the killing of Gen Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior figure in Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards, in a strike on an Iranian diplomatic building in the Syrian capital of Damascus for which Tehran holds Israel responsible. On Wednesday, Israel\u2019s foreign minister said his country\u2019s forces would strike Iran directly if it launched a retaliatory attack from its territory. \u201cIf Iran attacks from its territory, Israel will respond and attack in Iran,\u201d Israel Katz said in a post on X in both Farsi and Hebrew. Earlier on Wednesday, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, reiterated a promise to retaliate against Israel over the attack on its consulate in Damascus. Israel has attacked scores of Iranian-linked targets in Syria over the years with the apparent intent of disrupting arms transfers and other cooperation with Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran. Since the war in Gaza began six months ago, there have been near-daily exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and Hezbollah along the Israel-Lebanon border. With agencies"

            "content": "Protesters calling for Israel to cease fire in its war with Hamas who have disrupted US public events and infrastructure are practicing \u201cleftwing fascism\u201d or \u201cleftwing totalitarianism\u201d, a senior US House Democrat said, adding that such protesters are \u201cchallenging representative democracy\u201d and should be arrested. \u201cIntimidation is the tactic,\u201d said Adam Smith of Washington state, the ranking Democrat on the House armed services committee. \u201cIntimidation and an effort to silence opposition \u2026 I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s such a thing as leftwing fascism. If you want to just call it leftwing totalitarianism, then that\u2019s what it is. It is a direct challenge to representative democracy now.\u201d Smith was speaking \u2013 before the outbreak this week of mass protests on US college campuses, many producing arrests \u2013 to the One Decision Podcast and its guest host Christina Ruffini, a CBS News reporter. Ruffini asked Smith about protests in his district, including vandalism at his home and a town hall meeting disrupted by protesters demanding an end to the Israeli bombardment of Gaza prompted by attacks by Hamas on 7 October. Disruptive, aggressive protests are \u201cillegal \u2026 completely wrong \u2026 and enormously dangerous\u201d, Smith said, adding: \u201cI really want people to understand \u2013 and I put out a statement after they shut down a town hall meeting that I was trying to have [in March] \u2013 what\u2019s going on here. \u201cAnd everyone\u2019s like, \u2018Well, you understand their passion and all that. And I do understand that, I do. This is a life-or-death situation. It is certainly not the only life-or-death situation that I and all policymakers deal with. But it is one that is important. But that\u2019s not what [the protesters are] doing. \u201cWhat they are trying to do is they are trying to silence opposition and intimidate decision-makers. I\u2019ve been doing town hall meetings for 34 years now, in some pretty hotly contested environments \u2026 [but] I have never had a town hall that I couldn\u2019t keep under control enough so that people had the chance to say their piece. \u201cBut [the protesters\u2019] goal and their objective was not to get their point across. It was to silence anyone who dared to disagree with them, to make sure that only one voice was heard. And their other goal was to intimidate. That\u2019s why they\u2019re showing up at member\u2019s houses.\u201d More than 1,100 people were killed on 7 October when Hamas attacked Israel, also taking hostages. Since then, more than 34,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza, where the population also faces displacement and starvation. Protesters, Smith said, \u201cwould say, \u2018Children are dying. This is a huge humanitarian crisis.\u2019 And they\u2019re right about that \u2026 and by the way, I do have some sympathy with these people. If there are members of Congress who won\u2019t meet with them, I meet with them. All the time. So they have an opportunity to be heard. They\u2019re not trying to be heard. They\u2019re trying to silence people who disagree with them.\u201d Asked what kind of protest might be appropriate, Smith cited a recent instance in an armed services hearing in which \u201cpeople came in and they didn\u2019t say anything, they just held up bloody hands. And the chairman noticed that and said, \u2018You can\u2019t do that, you\u2019re out, and they got up and left.\u201d But he said: \u201cYou go back to the civil rights movement, they expected to be arrested, they knew they were violating the law. And also \u2026 you have to enforce the law. You have to make clear \u2026 that this is about more than just the issue. You know, they can be heard, but then other people get to be heard. \u201cYou come to our town hall meeting, it\u2019s one thing to try to get attention. They got their attention. But literally, they wouldn\u2019t stop screaming insults at me. They wouldn\u2019t \u2026 even let me answer the very questions they were raising. \u201cI got two words into it and they started screaming at me again. So this is a different thing than your standard protest. In my view, the solution to it is if they are committing a crime \u2013 which by the way, shutting down a freeway, shutting down an airport, intimidating people, there\u2019s a crime \u2013 [they] ought to be arrested.\u201d Protesting at public figures\u2019 homes should also be subject to arrest, Smith said. \u201cThe point of it is intimidation. And I think it is harassment. It\u2019s a crime, and I think [they should] be arrested for it. \u201c\u2026 But you know, when you are shutting down freeways, shutting down airports, frankly putting people\u2019s lives at risk \u2013 If you\u2019re an ambulance trying to get through to hospital \u2013 then that\u2019s going beyond getting your point across, and you\u2019re trying to intimidate and silence people in a way that I think is troubling.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-28T08:44:12Z",
            "content": "What is happening with ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas? There has been a recent flurry of activity around the talks, with an uptick of optimism about progress. According to Axios\u2019s Barak Ravid, the Israeli proposal is for a potential deal with Hamas for a ceasefire in exchange for the release of hostages and talks over the \u201crestoration of sustainable calm\u201d in Gaza. In recent days Hamas has also broadcast several proof-of-life videos of hostages who may be expected to be exchanged at some point during a deal, which could increase domestic political pressure on Israel, where the hostages\u2019 return is a potent issue. The language is instructive. \u201cSustainable calm\u201d suggests a solution somewhat short of the \u201ctotal victory\u201d repeatedly touted by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has vowed to dismantle Hamas. Intriguingly it also mirrors a suggestion for a truce from a senior Hamas official, Khalil al-Hayya, last week who floated the idea of a hudna, a word used in Islamic jurisprudence to describe a kind of long-term truce or \u201ccalm\u201d. However, the messaging coming out of the talks has been very contradictory. While the Qataris, who represent one mediation route, have talked publicly about their frustration over stalled talks, there has been more activity in recent days around Egyptian-Israeli talks \u2013 a forum that has delivered ceasefires in previous conflicts. A senior Israeli official told Hebrew media that talks with the Egyptians were \u201cvery good, focused, held in good spirits and progressed in all parameters\u201d. The position of the US, which has been pushing for a ceasefire deal, is that there is a good deal on the table, with the onus on Hamas to budge. With Hamas saying it is looking at the new Israeli offer, reports in the Israeli media on Sunday indicated recent meetings of the Israeli security cabinet suggested a more \u201cflexible\u201d position. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is also expected to visit Israel in the coming days to discuss the negotiations. What about Israel\u2019s threat to launch an offensive against Rafah? Israel has made it very clear that it is using the prospect of a Rafah operation, and its visible preparations for it \u2013 including the construction of large tented encampments \u2013 as an explicit threat to Hamas, essentially saying that this represents the last opportunity for a ceasefire. Complicating the issue, however, is the fact that Hamas is abundantly aware of the strong opposition internationally to Israel going into Rafah, not least in Washington, which has undercut this message. Underlining this, the New York Times said on Friday that the Biden administration was considering imposing restrictions on defence exports to Israel if it launched a large-scale operation in Rafah. Making the link explicit, Israel\u2019s foreign minister, Israel Katz, told Channel 12 in Israel after meeting the Egyptian delegation: \u201cIf there is a deal, we will suspend the operation. The release of the hostages is a deep priority for us.\u201d Some Israeli commentators are also pointing to speculation that the international criminal court may be considering issuing arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials as driving a renewed openness to talks. What\u2019s on the table? The essential shape of any deal has not changed that much. It would be presented as a \u201chumanitarian ceasefire\u201d. At the heart of talks is a ceasefire-for-hostages arrangement. Hamas would release hostages in exchange for a ceasefire lasting weeks and the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. The talks have stalled around both major issues \u2013 Hamas\u2019s maximalist demand that Israeli troops withdraw from Gaza and end the conflict \u2013 and granular detail, not least about numbers and which Palestinian prisoners should be released. The current formula would apparently allow the release of a slightly smaller number of hostages, 33 sick, elderly and wounded \u2013 representing the number of surviving hostages in the humanitarian category \u2013 in exchange for unspecified numbers of Palestinian prisoners. What is unclear is what the release of the humanitarian hostages would mean for those in other groups, including captive soldiers. Some reports have suggested that Israel has indicated willingness to make further concessions in the future, including withdrawing forces who are cutting the Gaza Strip in half and allowing the return of residents to the north. There are also suggestions that the conversation in Israeli security circles may have moved from the destruction of the last four largely intact Hamas battalions in Rafah to whether closing the Hamas arms-smuggling routes from Egypt would achieve the same long-term objective, requiring a new agreement with Egypt over control of \u2013 and monitoring of \u2013 the so-called Philadelphi route on the border. Are the talks in good faith? We have been here before, and there is a lot of cynicism in the positioning on both sides. Both Israel and Hamas will be manoeuvring to be able to suggest the other side is responsible for any failure in the current ceasefire talks. However there seems to be some genuine movement for now, although the devil is in the detail, not least over which Palestinian prisoners would be released. While the dynamics on the Hamas side remain largely opaque, not least around the position of the leader of Hamas in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, Netanyahu\u2019s difficulties with his own coalition remain in evidence. Far-right coalition partners, including the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, remain opposed to any deal. However, a recent uptick in public support for Netanyahu, and drop in support for the senior cabinet member Benny Gantz, may have taken some of the pressure off him. Speaking to Haaretz, a senior Qatari official accused both sides of sabotaging the process each time they came close to a deal."

            "content": "A popular Venezuelan YouTuber has been arrested in Caracas on terrorism charges as President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government steps up its crackdown on free speech ahead of upcoming elections. Oscar Alejandro P\u00e9rez was detained in the capital\u2019s main airport on Sunday by police on accusations of terrorism, his family said. The 37-year-old Venezuelan was about to fly to Canaima national park, a vast swath of forest and tabletop mountains in the south of the country, but is now believed to be under interrogation by anti-terrorism investigators. \u201cAccording to available preliminary reports, the arrest is linked to accusations of terrorism-related activities,\u201d the statement from relatives reads. Venezuela\u2019s government has increasingly used \u201cterrorism\u201d as a catch-all-term to jail opposition figures, rights observers and researchers in recent months. The accelerating crackdown is an attempt to silence all political discussion through intimidation ahead of elections expected for July, rights groups say. The popular opposition figure Maria Corina Machado was forced to withdraw from the presidential contest last week after two of her closest aides were arrested. Machado\u2019s last-minute replacement, the 80-year-old philosopher Corina Yoris, was then barred from entering July\u2019s contest by Venezuela\u2019s electoral body. The government is becoming increasingly indiscriminate in its crackdown, rounding up friends and family members of government targets too, say rights experts. In February Maduro banished a UN human rights office from Caracas for criticising the arrest of the lawyer and military expert Roc\u00edo San Miguel. P\u00e9rez\u2019s arrest suggests Maduro is now casting the net even wider to include influencers. The former radio host is best known for his travel videos on YouTube where he has amassed nearly 2 million followers. Among his most recent videos P\u00e9rez gave a behind-the-scenes tour at Inter Miami Football Club, interviewed a content creator on OnlyFans and reviewed Apple\u2019s new 3D headset. Though based in Miami, P\u00e9rez has spent more time in Venezuela in recent years, highlighting the country\u2019s natural beauty but also the reality of its economic collapse by showing empty resorts, supermarket shelves and gas stations. More than 7 million Venezuelans have fled the country\u2019s economic, social and humanitarian turmoil in the last decade \u2013 the largest exodus of people in Latin America\u2019s recent history. P\u00e9rez\u2019s family said a hearing was expected for Monday in which they hoped the government \u201cwill clarify the details of the situation and ensure fair treatment in accordance with Oscar Alejandro\u2019s legal rights\u201d. Following the announcement of P\u00e9rez\u2019s arrest Maduro supporters have shared a short clip taken from one of the blogger\u2019s videos in which he appears to mock the fragility of Venezuela\u2019s financial system. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 April 2024 to correct the name of the Venezuelan opposition politician, Maria Corina Machado."

            "date": "2024-04-25T11:10:57Z",
            "content": "Five of the seven teenagers arrested as part of counter-terrorism raids in Sydney have been charged with a range of terrorism offences. Two boys, aged 17 and 14, were charged at Parramatta children\u2019s court on Thursday with possessing or controlling violent extremist material, and two 16-year-old boys were charged with conspiring to engage in an act in preparation for, or planning, a terrorist act. One 17-year-old boy was charged with conspiring to engage in an act in preparation for, or planning, a terrorist act and for custody of a knife in a public place. All five were refused bail. Another boy remained in custody without charge on Thursday evening, 30 hours after the raids. A seventh juvenile was released on Thursday pending further inquiries. On Wednesday, about 400 officers from New South Wales police and the Australian federal police executed 13 search warrants across a number of suburbs in Sydney, including Bankstown, Prestons, Casula, Lurnea, Rydalmere, Greenacre, Strathfield, Chester Hill and Punchbowl, as well as a premises in Goulburn. The raids led to the arrests, with police saying a further five people, including two men and three juvenile males, assisted police with their inquiries. Police said a number of items were seized, including a \u201csignificant amount of electronic material\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The arrests and charges come amid the ongoing investigation into the 16-year-old who allegedly stabbed bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel at the Assyrian Christ the Good Shepherd Church in Wakeley last week. The assault, during a livestreamed sermon, sparked a riot of more than 2,000 people and the search for the offenders continued when two men faced court on Thursday. Leon Shemaon, 31, from Fairfield, was accused of rioting and trying to throw a missile at police. He was bailed on seven conditions. One mandates Shemaon not to contact anyone he knows was inside or outside the church on 15 April. A second alleged rioter was refused bail. Both men are due back in court on May 23. The counter-terror arrests were carried out by the Sydney joint counter-terrorism team, comprised of members of the NSW police, Australian federal police, Australian security intelligence organisation (Asio) and NSW crime commission. In a statement, NSW police and the AFP said there remained \u201cno specific threat to public safety and no threat to Anzac Day commemorations\u201d. At a press conference on Wednesday, the deputy commissioner of the AFP, Krissy Barrett, said that authorities did not believe there was any evidence of a specific planned attack. \u201cWe identified links between the alleged offender and a network of associates and peers who we believe shared a similar violent extremist ideology. \u201cAt this time, we have no evidence of specific locations, times, or targets of a violent act,\u201d she said. The deputy commissioner of NSW police, David Hudson, said the arrests came amid ongoing concerns that \u201cit was likely that an attack might ensue\u201d. \u201cIt was considered that the group, subject of our attention, posed an unacceptable risk to the people of New South Wales, and our current purely investigative strategies could not adequately ensure public safety. \u201cTheir behaviour, whilst under that surveillance, led us to believe that, if they were to commit any act, we would not be able to prevent that.\u201d He described the group as being \u201cloose\u201d in nature, and that there were \u201csplintering factions\u201d. \u201cNo specific targets had been nominated. However, it\u2019s just the ongoing threat and loose nature of the group as well. Whilst coordinated to some degree, there were splinter factions doing their own thing as well.\u201d"

            "title": "Is violently terrorising a community \u2018terrorism\u2019? It\u2019s an uncomfortable debate to have  | Karen Middleton",
            "date": "2024-04-19T15:00:03Z",
            "content": "As the nation reels from two terrible stabbing incidents in Sydney, two days apart, a question emerges that\u2019s not easy to address. When is violently terrorising a community \u201cterrorism\u201d and when is it not? It\u2019s not a debate that leaders and law-enforcers are terribly keen to have. It\u2019s very tricky terrain. Assyrian christian orthodox Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel was stabbed mid-sermon at his church in the western suburb of Wakeley on Monday night in what has been designated a terrorist act. Preceding that, on Saturday afternoon, five women and a male security guard were killed in a stabbing rampage at Bondi Junction\u2019s Westfield shopping centre in which the male attacker was shot dead. Police see that very differently. In one section of the Australian community, there is some unease that the Wakeley church incident was so quickly branded terrorism. In another, some point to the crisis of violence against women and ask why the Bondi Junction incident wasn\u2019t. Plenty of people will support the decision in both cases. Government and law enforcement see a clear distinction between the two kinds of incidents. On Friday, federal attorney general Mark Dreyfus condemned violence against women but warned against \u201cblurring lines\u201d around terrorism and said on ABC Radio National that revisiting definitions was \u201cgoing down a wrong path\u201d. There are some basic contrasts between the two awful events. One resulted in multiple fatalities and the other, mercifully, did not. In one, the male accused was killed and in the other, the alleged attacker \u2013 a child \u2013 is still alive. At Bondi Junction, people appeared to have been targeted at random, but the church attack appeared specific. Crowd responses to police were also markedly different. At Bondi Junction, all of those who died were women except the heroic security guard, Faraz Tahir, who tried to disarm the attacker. There are also overlapping factors, beyond that the incidents occurred on opposite sides of the same city. Both were knife attacks in places where people gather. Both of the accused were \u201cknown to police\u201d. In both cases, a history of mental illness, or behaviour consistent with it, has been cited. But in one case the mental illness was given primary emphasis in determining the nature of the incident. In the other, it was deemed secondary to religious beliefs. It\u2019s the fact that the 16-year-old alleged attacker at the Assyrian Christ the Good Shepherd church made remarks of a religious nature that saw that incident designated a terrorist act. Targeting one group \u2013 members of a church \u2013 constituted terrorism while targeting another \u2013 women \u2013 did not. The definition of terrorism under Australian law focuses on the motives of an alleged perpetrator, not who they target, though the two may be related. In summary, a terrorist act is defined in section 100.1 of the Criminal Code Act as an action or threat made with the intention of \u201cadvancing a political, religious or ideological cause\u201d and of coercing or influencing through intimidation a domestic or foreign government or the public or \u201ca section of the public\u201d. To meet the definition, the action must fit within a list of other criteria. These include that it: causes death or serious physical harm; puts a life other than the perpetrator\u2019s at risk; seriously jeopardises public health or safety; causes serious damage to property; or seriously interferes with, disrupts or destroys a designated electronic system. Designated systems include those covering information, telecommunications, finance, delivery of essential government services, or systems used for or by an essential public utility or a transport system. The definition still leaves room for judgment. For example, it\u2019s not clear how the agencies untangle extreme religious or ideological influences from the impact of past life experiences and personal trauma in deciding what drove someone to an act. What constitutes an \u201cideological cause\u201d is also a grey area. At its most basic, ideology is a set of opinions or beliefs. Hating women \u2013 a \u201csection of the public\u201d \u2013 would seem on the face of it to fit that bill. Designating something as a terrorist act unlocks considerably more serious security powers than are available in cases of criminal violence, including powers to detain and question. This is obviously more relevant to police and other agencies when an alleged perpetrator is still alive. New South Wales police commissioner Karen Webb decided quickly that the Wakeley incident met the definition. Explaining this on Tuesday, Webb said she was convinced within hours that it constituted religiously motivated extremism. That it occurred while the church service was being livestreamed told her it was intended to intimidate the public. Newly appointed race discrimination commissioner Giridharan Sivaraman is among those uneasy about the speed of that designation. Sivaraman, who took up his position late last month, said he feared it could fuel racial prejudice more broadly. \u201cThere are just implications when you characterise things in a particular way,\u201d he warned on Radio National on Thursday. On Friday, Australian federal police commissioner Reece Kershaw moved to reassure those sharing Sivaraman\u2019s concerns. \u201cWe target criminality, not countries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe investigate radicalisation and not religion. There is a saying in police. \u2018The police are the community and the community are the police\u2019. We are only as strong and effective as our bond to each other.\u201d In the Bondi Junction attack, Webb suggested misogyny was an \u201cobvious\u201d line of inquiry. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious to me, it\u2019s obvious to detectives that it seems to be an area of interest that the offender focused on women and avoided the men,\u201d Webb said on Monday. She did not canvas whether misogyny fitted the definition of terrorism. Asio director general Mike Burgess endorsed the Wakeley event\u2019s designation at a news conference on Tuesday. Interestingly, Burgess had used words similar to Kershaw\u2019s in his annual national threat assessment back in 2021. In a speech that now seems especially prescient for what it wove together, Burgess also emphasised that security and law-enforcement agencies \u201cdon\u2019t investigate people because of their religious views\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s violence that is relevant to our powers\u201d. \u201cBut,\u201d he conceded at the time, \u201cthat\u2019s not always clear when we use the term \u2018Islamic extremism\u2019.\u201d Back then, Burgess acknowledged that some in the Muslim community saw this as \u201cdamaging and misrepresentative of Islam\u201d, and considered that it stigmatised them by \u201cencouraging stereotyping and stoking division\u201d. \u201cOur language needs to evolve to match the evolving threat environment,\u201d he ventured in 2021. Even more interestingly, in the same speech, Burgess suggested violent misogyny also qualified as extremism by his agency\u2019s definitions. \u201cWe are seeing a growing number of individuals and groups that don\u2019t fit on the left\u2013right spectrum at all; instead, they\u2019re motivated by a fear of societal collapse or a specific social or economic grievance or conspiracy,\u201d Burgess said . \u201cFor example, the violent misogynists who adhere to the involuntary celibate or \u2018incel\u2019 ideology fit into this category. So we need to use language that can accommodate groups that are outside the traditional categories.\u201d In light of that, two terrible events prompt one more question: how much has changed?"

Earlier on Thursday the first person arrested and charged for taking part in a riot that broke out in the aftermath of the alleged stabbing of Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel, 53, at the Assyrian Christ the Good Shepherd church appeared at court. Dani Mansour, 19, was charged with riot, affray and destroying or damaging property as part of the crowd who allegedly attacked police on Monday night. A 39-year-old priest was also allegedly stabbed by the 16-year-old after trying to intervene, according to police. He and the bishop were expected to recover after undergoing surgery. The church on Thursday released an audio statement from Emmanuel in which the bishop, speaking from his hospital bed, said he was recovering well and that he was praying for his alleged attacker. Emmanuel, who has a popular online presence and a large following, has previously criticised Islam and the prophet Muhammad in public sermons. The teenager who allegedly attacked him was charged as part of a joint investigation with the Australian federal police, Asio and the New South Wales Crime Commission that was launched after NSW police declared the alleged stabbing a \u201cterrorist act\u201d.

Six teenagers were charged after counter-terrorism raids in Sydney last week, with two of them appearing in the children\u2019s court at Parramatta on Tuesday. Both boys cannot be named for legal reasons. The 16-year-old has been charged with conspiring to engage in an act in preparation for, or planning, a terrorist act and for custody of a knife in a public place. The court heard he sent a number of text messages in April where he spoke of obtaining guns, a search for a stash house, and preparations for \u201cbig stuff\u201d. \u201cThis is serious shit, we\u2019re going to kill.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The 16-year-old had also allegedly discussed a \u201ckuffar plan\u201d, described to the court as a \u201cnon-believer\u201d plan. In another message, responding to a friend who allegedly said they would do something \u201cwe won\u2019t get done for\u201d, the court heard that the 16-year-old responded: \u201cshooting and bombs [are] too hard\u201d. The friend then allegedly responded: \u201cWhat about stabbing?\u201d The court heard the 16-year-old had posted on social media in support of the 16-year-old who allegedly stabbed Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel at the Assyrian Christ the Good Shepherd church in Wakeley earlier this month. The court heard he had also changed his profile picture on an online forum to a picture of a person carrying a rifle and Islamic state flag. The 16-year-old\u2019s lawyer, the defence barrister Greg James KC, told the court that bail should be granted on the basis of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, including his age, his clean criminal record, and that there was no terrorist act specified in the text messages. The court heard the 16-year-old\u2019s parents, who were present for the hearing, wrote an affidavit describing an \u201cexcellent son\u201d who was a good student. They had never had any complaints about his behaviour, and he had planned to go to university after finishing Tafe. \u201cTheir material suggest he is a young man who would likely otherwise have a bright future,\u201d Magistrate Janet Wahlquist said. A 17-year-old, who has been charged with possessing or controlling violent extremist material, was granted bail in the same court on Tuesday under strict conditions, including not being allowed to leave the house without parental supervision, and not having a computer or phone that has internet access. The prosecution, which opposed the bail, acknowledged that the charges against the 17-year-old were less serious than charges against the 16-year-old. The court heard that the 17-year-old was already on bail for another offence, leading to the seizure of his phone and discovery of alleged extremist material, which included 124 files on his phone. The material allegedly included a video of an assault with the Islamic State symbol watermarked over the video. The New South Wales joint counter-terrorism team executed 13 search warrants on Wednesday that resulted in the arrest of seven teenagers described as \u201cassociates\u201d of a 16-year-old who allegedly stabbed the bishop in Wakeley last week. Six of those teenagers have since been charged with terrorism offences. The arrests and charges come amid the ongoing investigation into the 16-year-old who allegedly stabbed the bishop. The parents of the 16-year-old told ABC that their son had experienced mental health problems throughout his school life, and had suspected autism. \u201cHe saw so many counsellors in his schools and we saw more than two psychologists and they\u2019re all saying like \u2018he have a problem, he have issue when he gets angry\u2019,\u201d his mother said in an interview aired on Monday."

The belief that influenza is the world\u2019s greatest pandemic threat is based on long-term research showing it is constantly evolving and mutating, said Cologne University\u2019s Jon Salmanton-Garc\u00eda, who carried out the study. \u201cEach winter influenza appears,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could describe these outbreaks as little pandemics. They are more or less controlled because the different strains that cause them are not virulent enough \u2013 but that will not necessarily be the case for ever.\u201d Details of the survey \u2013 which involved inputs from a total of 187 senior scientists \u2013 will be revealed at European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) congress in Barcelona next weekend. The next most likely cause of a pandemic, after influenza, is likely to be a virus \u2013 dubbed Disease X \u2013 that is still unknown to science, according to 21% of the experts who took part in the study. They believe the next pandemic will be caused by an as-yet-to-be-identified micro-organism that will appear out of the blue, just as the Sars-CoV-2 virus, the cause of Covid-19, did, when it started to infect humans in 2019. Indeed, some scientists still believe Sars-CoV-2 remains a threat, with 15% of the scientists surveyed in the study rating it their most likely cause of a pandemic in the near future. Other deadly micro-organisms \u2013 such as Lassa, Nipah, Ebola and Zika viruses \u2013 were rated as serious global threats by only 1% to 2% of respondents. \u201cInfluenza remained \u2013 by a very large degree, the number one threat in terms of its pandemic potential in the eyes of a large majority of world scientists,\u201d added Salmanton-Garc\u00eda. Last week, the World Health Organization raised fears about the alarming spread of the H5N1 strain of influenza that is causing millions of cases of avian flu across the globe. This outbreak began in 2020 and has led to the deaths or killing of tens of millions of poultry and has also wiped out millions of wild birds. Most recently, the virus has spread to mammal species, including domestic cattle which are now infected in 12 states in the US, further increasing fears about the risks to humans. The more mammalian species the virus infects, the more opportunities it has to evolve into a strain that is dangerous to humans, Daniel Goldhill, of the Royal Veterinary College in Hatfield, told the journal Nature last week. The appearance of the H5N1 virus in cattle was a surprise, added virologist Ed Hutchinson, of Glasgow University. \u201cPigs can get avian flu but until recently cattle did not. They were infected with their own strains of the disease. So the appearance of H5N1 in cows was a shock. \u201cIt means that the risks of the virus getting into more and more farm animals, and then from farm animals into humans just gets higher and higher. The more the virus spreads, then the chances of it mutating so it can spread into humans goes up and up. Basically, we are rolling the dice with this virus.\u201d To date, there has been no indication that H5N1 is spreading between humans. But in hundreds of cases where humans have been infected through contact with animals over the past 20 years, the impact has been grim. \u201cThe mortality rate is extraordinarily high because humans have no natural immunity to the virus\u201d, said Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist of the World Health Organization. The prospect of a flu pandemic is alarming, although scientists also point out that vaccines against many strains, including H5N1, have already been developed. \u201cIf there was an avian flu pandemic it would still be a massive logistical challenge to produce vaccines at the scale and speed that will be needed. However, we would be much further down that road than we were with Covid-19 when a vaccine had to be developed from scratch,\u201d said Hutchinson. Nevertheless, some lessons of preventing disease spread have been forgotten since the end of the Covid pandemic, said Salmanton-Garc\u00eda. \u201cPeople have gone back to coughing into their hands and then shaking hands with other people. Mask-wearing has disappeared. We are going back to our old bad habits. We may come to regret that.\u201d"

            "title": "Covid pandemic made poorest countries even worse off, World Bank warns",
            "date": "2024-04-15T10:00:45Z",
            "content": "The devastating impact of the pandemic on the world\u2019s poorest countries has brought poverty reduction to a halt and led to a widening income gap with nations in the rich west, the World Bank has warned. In a report released to coincide with its half-yearly meeting, the Washington-based organisation said half of the world\u2019s 75 poorest nations had seen income per head rise more slowly than in developed countries over the past five years. Urging governments and the private sector to do more to help tackle what it called a \u201cgreat reversal\u201d, the Bank said that since 2019 there had been a surge in food insecurity and debt distress. The Bank\u2019s data showed that one in three countries eligible for grants and concessional loans under its International Development Association (IDA) arm was poorer, on average, than it was on the eve of the Covid-19 pandemic. Not since the last five years of the 20th century had more than half of the poorest countries experienced income per head grow more slowly than in developed countries. Ajay Banga, the World Bank\u2019s president, will use the bleak findings of the report to press donors \u2013 who meet every three years to replenish IDA \u2013 to be generous. Final pledges will not be made until the end of 2024 but Banga has already said the needs of poor countries mean the next round of funding should be the \u201clargest of all time\u201d. Although countries rich and poor were affected by the pandemic, the Bank\u2019s study found the extreme-poverty rate in the most hard-pressed countries was more than eight times the average in the rest of the world. One in four people in IDA countries had to manage on less than $2.15 a day \u2013 the global definition of poverty. \u201cThese countries now account for 90% of all people facing hunger or malnutrition,\u201d the Bank said. \u201cHalf of these countries are either in debt distress or at high risk of it. Still, except for the World Bank Group and other multilateral development donors, foreign lenders \u2013 private as well as government creditors \u2013 have been backing away from them.\u201d More than half of all IDA countries \u2013 39 of the 75 \u2013 are in sub-Saharan Africa, while 14, mainly small island states are in east Asia. Eight are in Latin America and the Caribbean, and in south Asia, only India is not an IDA country. The Bank said 31 IDA countries had per capita incomes of less than $1,315 a year (\u00a31,050), while 33 were fragile and conflict-affected states. On the positive side, the Bank said at a time when populations were ageing nearly everywhere else, IDA countries would enjoy a growing share of young workers through 2070 \u2013 a potential \u201cdemographic dividend\u201d. They were also rich in natural resources, had high potential for solar-energy generation, and boasted a large reservoir of mineral deposits that could be crucial for the world\u2019s transition to clean energy. \u201cThe world cannot afford to turn its back on IDA countries,\u201d said Indermit Gill, the World Bank\u2019s chief economist. \u201cThe welfare of these countries has always been crucial to the long-term outlook for global prosperity. Three of the world\u2019s economic powerhouses today \u2013 China, India, and South Korea \u2013 were all once IDA borrowers. All three prospered in ways that whittled down extreme poverty and raised living standards. With help from abroad, today\u2019s batch of IDA countries has the potential to do the same.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-21T21:12:47Z",
            "content": "The Senate committee that has been examining Australia\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has recommended the establishment of a royal commission, arguing the case for a full-blown inquiry with investigative powers is \u201coverwhelming\u201d. In a report tabled out of parliamentary session on Friday, the Senate\u2019s legal and constitutional affairs committee said a royal commission should be created to examine the key elements of the pandemic\u2019s emergency phase. These should include virus testing, contact tracing, quarantine protocols, the impact of lockdowns, the procurement of vaccines and the capacity of the health, education, aged care and housing and domestic violence systems to respond to the crisis. It advocated looking at all this in light of costs and benefits, in order to record lessons to be learned. The report also said the commission should look at the impact of these policies on different sections of the community. Among the committee\u2019s seven members, the decision to call for a royal commission was not universal. The Coalition members \u2013 whose government under Scott Morrison was in office through the pandemic\u2019s emergency phase \u2013 called for the further inquiry, along with the Greens. Members who were part of the Albanese Labor government argued their own now-completed Senate inquiry would suffice. \u201cThere are strong views with respect to a range of issues, including the response of federal and state governments,\u201d the committee\u2019s majority report said. It was \u201cimperative\u201d that Australia learn from Covid-19 in preparing for any future pandemic. The committee is chaired by the Liberal senator Paul Scarr and has one other Liberal and one Nationals member. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The sole Greens representative, senator David Shoebridge, also endorsed the call. \u201cWhen an extraordinary event of the scale of the Covid-19 pandemic occurs it would be foolish not to reflect on how society responded to it, to learn valuable lessons that can be applied in the future,\u201d Shoebridge says in additional remarks in the report. \u201cA royal commission has the independence needed, including the power to compel answers from often unwilling governments, to give the public confidence that its final report and any recommendations will be credible and unbiased. \u201cWith all the sacrifices we made Australians deserve at least this\u201d. In disagreeing with the royal commission call, deputy chair and Labor senator Nita Green and fellow Labor senator Varun Ghosh pointed to a separate government-commissioned independent 12-month inquiry into the Covid-19 response, led by Robyn Kruk AO, which is due to report on 30 September. Its scope does not include state and territory decisions, including on lockdowns. The Labor senators said that inquiry will report \u201csignificantly earlier than a royal commission would have reported, thereby allowing Australia to learn the lessons of the Covid-19 response and improve our preparedness for future pandemics earlier than a royal commission would have permitted\u201d. \u201cIn recent times, some royal commissions have taken many years \u2013 up to half a decade \u2013 to report,\u201d they say. The pair argued there was \u201cunnecessary duplication\u201d between the proposed royal commission and \u201cnumerous\u201d other inquiries. The report said there should be particular scrutiny of the policies and practices relating to lockdowns, school closures, social distancing, mask mandates, remote working arrangements, border closures, quarantine rules, vaccine mandates, the vaccine-claims system, governance structures, government decision-making and communications, supply chains, the labour market and business sustainability. It said a commission should examine the adequacy of planning on the heath, social, economic and human rights implications of the pandemic, the consistency between planning and actual response and the level of coordination between governments. It also recommended that the federal government encourage the states and territories to pass complementary legislation to allow them to also participate in a national royal commission. \u201cThe committee considers that there is an overwhelming case for the establishment of a Covid-19 royal commission,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe people of Australia deserve an opportunity to learn from the experiences of the Covid-19 pandemic and the response to it.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-29T16:09:34Z",
            "content": "The grocery courier firm Getir is to quit the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and the US to focus on its home market of Turkey amid heavy competition and waning demand for rapid home deliveries. The closure marks the latest shakeout of the fast grocery delivery industry which grew rapidly during the Covid pandemic but has sharply retreated since. It is not clear how many jobs are affected. In late 2021 the group had 1,500 employees in the UK, according to accounts filed at Companies House, most of whom were likely to be delivery riders. However, the group has since ceased operating in several British cities including Liverpool and Birmingham. The latest retreat comes after Getir cut 2,500 jobs \u2013 more than a tenth of its workforce \u2013 last year. The company pulled out of France, Spain, Italy and Portugal as the cost of living crisis dampened demand for grocery deliveries in less than 20 minutes, while its own costs have also gone up. Getir said it would retain its US arm FreshDirect \u2013 only bought a few months ago \u2013 and said the closures only affected 7% of sales. Set up in 2015, Getir grew into one of the largest of more than a dozen delivery app companies, promising to deliver groceries in minutes and offering hefty discounts to attract customers. However, most of its rivals have been sold or closed down. Those that remain have tightened their operations, laying off riders and selling warehouses. Getir bought its German rival Gorillas in a $1.2bn (\u00a3960m) deal in 2022 after snapping up the UK\u2019s Weezy a year earlier. The smaller London-based firm Jiffy ceased deliveries in 2022 while the US operator Gopuff bought Fancy and Dija, both UK companies, in 2021. Getir was valued at up to $11.8bn when it raised funds in March 2022, but its valuation was slashed to $6.5bn in a funding round in April last year. The market continues to be highly competitive: the takeaway delivery firms Deliveroo, JustEat and Uber Eats have tied up with supermarkets to deliver groceries, while Tesco has its in-house service Whoosh, Sainsbury\u2019s has Chop Chop and Ocado has Zoom. One of the last remaining quick grocery specialists, Gopuff, launched in the UK in 2021, and operates in London and other big cities including Bristol, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Birmingham, Leeds and Cardiff. Zapp continues to operate in London."

            "title": "UK Covid takeaway habits endure as fast food calorie intake remains high",
            "date": "2024-04-04T06:00:07Z",
            "content": "Delivery app riders pedalling through cities and tailbacks at drive-throughs were familiar signs of Britain\u2019s hunger for takeaway food at the peak of the Covid pandemic. Now a study suggests it became an enduring habit. After a boom in orders on Deliveroo, Just Eat and other platforms by locked-down consumers, research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggests the popularity of takeaways, meal deliveries and food-on-the-go bought from retailer such as sandwiches and crisps has remained above pre-pandemic levels after the removal of Covid restrictions. Analysing data on shopping habits from thousands of consumers, the thinktank said calorie consumption from takeaway food grew by more than 50% during the height of the pandemic \u2013 and had stayed high thereafter, as households continued to opt for a night in front of the TV instead of a meal at restaurant or pub. Highlighting a big shift in the country\u2019s diet and sources of nutrition, the IFS said a legacy of the Covid lockdowns could include long-term effects on health and weight. The study, which was funded by the Obesity Policy Research Unit at University College London, estimated that before the pandemic, the average UK adult consumed about 270 calories a week from takeaways. This increased to 395 calories a week during the first lockdown in 2020, when restaurants, pubs and cafes were forced to close as the pandemic spread. While the reopening of hospitality later in the year fuelled a decline in takeaway consumption, levels still remained higher than before the pandemic \u2013 even while the government\u2019s \u201ceat out to help out\u201d scheme was in place. During the third national lockdown in England in 2021, calorie consumption from takeaways ballooned further to an average of 470 calories a week as the country adapted to living with the pandemic and more restaurants and pubs switched to accommodate takeaway orders. However, despite the easing of restrictions, these higher levels endured after the widespread reopening of hospitality venues, at about 400 calories a week by early 2022 \u2013 50% above pre-pandemic levels. The researchers said they had only been able to examine data up to the first quarter of 2022 , before the cost of living crisis. This meaning it is not entirely clear whether the UK\u2019s takeaway habit survived the sharpest jump in food prices since the 1970s. However, the initial findings suggest a marked shift. The study also found the size of households\u2019 food shopping baskets increased at the height of the pandemic in 2020, but then largely returned to normal. Overall calorie purchases had returned to 2019 levels by 2022, suggesting that the increase in takeaways has come at the expense of coffee shops, pubs and restaurants. Andrew McKendrick, a research economist at IFS, said: \u201cLockdowns and closures of hospitality left a bigger role for consumption of food at home and for takeaways. But, by the start of 2022, most of these changes had been reversed: households had largely gone back to purchasing as much as they did in 2019. \u201cThe pandemic did leave one legacy, though, in the much-increased use of takeaways.\u201d"
