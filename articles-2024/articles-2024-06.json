            "content": "Labour has challenged the Conservatives to match its commitment to strengthen the economic watchdog within the first 100 days of government. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has pledged to introduce legislation giving the Office for Budget Responsibility greater powers in Labour\u2019s first king\u2019s speech. Labour\u2019s planned law would empower the OBR to independently publish a forecast of any major fiscal event making significant tax and spending changes. The changes are intended to prevent a repeat of Liz Truss\u2019s catastrophic mini-budget, which was delivered without an OBR forecast, by preventing ministers from \u201cgagging\u201d the watchdog in future. Truss\u2019s mini-budget included \u00a345bn of unfunded tax cuts and caused a meltdown in the financial markets, including a collapse in the value of the pound. Reeves challenged Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, to match her commitment after the Guardian published a leaked recording where he said Truss\u2019s economic plans were a \u201cgood thing to aim for\u201d. Reeves told the Guardian: \u201cBritain is still paying the price of Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget that crashed the economy, put pensions in peril and sent mortgage bills soaring. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from Jeremy Hunt\u2019s comments that he has learnt absolutely nothing from that period and is instead pandering to the reckless voices in his party.\u201d Speaking ahead of this week\u2019s inflation figures and the Bank of England\u2019s decision on interest rates, Reeves promised: \u201cNever again can a prime minister or chancellor repeat the chaos we witnessed under Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng.\u201d She challenged Hunt to \u201cshow some courage\u201d and back Labour\u2019s plans, and warned that if he did not then he was \u201cconfirming that the biggest threat to the economy is five more years of the Conservatives\u201d. In leaked remarks to the Oxford University Conservatives on 9 May, Hunt can be heard saying, to some laughter, that Truss \u201cappointed me as chancellor \u2026 you know, I want to be respectful of that fact. But I think the issue with most of the policies wasn\u2019t that they weren\u2019t a good thing to aim for.\u201d He said Truss \u201cdidn\u2019t explain in that mini-budget how she was to fund [her tax cuts]. And so markets thought that we were just basically going to fund all these tax cuts by massively increasing borrowing. And they took fright.\u201d The chancellor said he hoped to \u201cbasically achieve some of the same things that she wanted to achieve. But I\u2019m doing it more gradually because I\u2019m demonstrating at every stage that this is consistent with keeping borrowing under control. So, it\u2019s taking longer to get there, but I think it\u2019s obviously in a way we can actually deliver it.\u201d Labour said Hunt\u2019s remarks showed that the Conservatives had an \u201caddiction to dangerous Trussonomics\u201d. A Conservative party spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ll take no lectures from the Labour party, given it was a Conservative government that created the OBR to stop Labour governments fiddling the figures and losing control of the public finances. The Labour party need to stop distracting the public from their \u00a32,094 tax bombshell on working people.\u201d The Conservatives have been criticised for claiming Labour\u2019s policies would result in a \u00a32,000 tax hike as the figure is based on assumptions by Tory special advisers. It came as political donation reports showed Hunt has received over \u00a314,000 for his constituency campaign from the hedge fund manager Andrew Law, who reportedly hosted Kwarteng, the chancellor under Truss, for a champagne reception on the day of the mini-budget. The Times reported in 2022 that Law is likely to have profited from shorting the pound in the run-up to the mini-budget, and that he hosted a reception with other financiers and Kwarteng at his west London home on the evening after it was delivered. Records released by the Electoral Commission this month state that Law, a Tory donor and financier who is worth \u00a3750m, has donated \u00a314,286 to Hunt\u2019s campaign in Godalming and Ash. He gave Hunt\u2019s local party donations of \u00a37,143 in October and again in January. Law previously donated to Hunt\u2019s old constituency South West Surrey. A Liberal Democrat source said: \u201cThe Liberal Democrats are on the up in Godalming and Ash. There\u2019s no doubt that Jeremy Hunt needs all the help he can get, but the chancellor should know better than to accept money potentially made by betting against our country.\u201d Law\u2019s hedge fund, Caxton Associates, was contacted for comment."

            "date": "2024-06-19T17:00:12Z",
            "content": "Labour\u2019s plans for ending Britain\u2019s long-term economic stagnation have been backed by a group of leading economists, including three Nobel prize winners and a former Bank of England deputy governor. In a boost to the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, the 16 UK and internationally based economists said change was \u201cdesperately needed\u201d after the policy mistakes and failures of the past 14 years since the Conservatives took power. Reeves and the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, have been accused by the Conservatives of having no plan for the economy but, in a letter to the Guardian, the economists say Labour offers a \u201ccredible alternative\u201d. The letter\u2019s signatories include the Nobel prize winners Joe Stiglitz, Sir Christopher Pissarides and Sir Angus Deaton, as well as Sir Charles Bean, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England. The economy has featured heavily in the election campaign, with Rishi Sunak saying the latest fall in the annual inflation rate to its 2% target showed that the UK had \u201cturned a corner\u201d. Labour has said \u201cTory chaos\u201d has been responsible for weak growth and higher taxes \u2013 a view that is shared by the group of economists. \u201cBritain has suffered a long period of economic stagnation over the last 14 years, with low growth in productivity, real wages and living standards,\u201d the letter says. \u201cNot only is this record poor by historical standards, but the UK has also underperformed compared to its international peers. We invest too little and too inefficiently \u2013 especially in skills, infrastructure and innovation.\u201d While Starmer and Reeves have been criticised by some on the left for a cautious approach that has seen them largely mirror Conservative tax, spending and borrowing plans, the letter identifies four areas where it says Labour would make a difference. A key problem, it says, has been the number of policy mistakes, U-turns and changes of leadership, which have helped create \u201chuge investment-sapping uncertainty\u201d. Since 2010, Britain has had five prime ministers and seven chancellors. The economists say structural reforms are needed to improve the UK\u2019s public infrastructure and housing, especially around the planning system, which Labour has pledged to speed up. They also support the party\u2019s commitment to improving the post-Brexit trade relationship with the EU and say fresh urgency is needed to speed up the transition to net zero and sustainable growth. Labour is committed to decarbonising the electricity supply by 2030 \u2013 which is considered to be an ambitious target by energy experts. \u201cChange is desperately needed\u201d, the letter says. \u201cContrary to what the government has been saying, we believe that Labour provides a credible economic alternative across all these dimensions, and that Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves offer a combination of stability and an ambitious set of reforms to help grow the economy.\u201d Among the other signatories to the letter are Richard Layard, the labour market expert and Labour peer; Prof Mariana Mazzucato, the founding director of the Institute for Innovation and Public Policy at University College London; and Prof David Blanchflower, a former interest-rate setter on the Bank of England\u2019s \u2019s monetary policy committee. Blanchflower told the Guardian it was welcome that Labour had the endorsement of economists and doubted whether the Conservatives could put together a similar list backing their economic strategy. \u201cThey would struggle to find anybody with any clout\u201d, he said. \u201cHow many Nobel prize winners support the Conservatives?\u201d Blanchflower also said it was important Reeves and Starmer had a firm plan if they win the election on 4 July. \u201cThey are going to be elected, so what are they going to do then? You can\u2019t just be Tory-lite\u201d, he said."

            "date": "2024-06-12T06:00:18Z",
            "content": "A failure to invest in the UK\u2019s main regional cities has held back economic growth and meant standards of living lag behind the US, France and Germany, according to a report before the 50th G7 summit in southern Italy this week. The Centre for Cities thinktank said the major difference between the UK and its main rivals was the low level of productivity in cities such as Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Sheffield and Nottingham. It said the higher level of productivity \u2013 measured by the output of each worker per hour \u2013 could be seen in cities outside Paris and Berlin of a similar size to their UK counterparts. The study found that investment was also spread more evenly across a wide range of US cities, which have performed well after benefiting from local financial support and, more recently, the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act and Chips Act, which offer more than \u00a3800bn worth of subsidies over 10 years. Lyon and Frankfurt were ranked more highly than Birmingham and Manchester and made the difference between the UK being the top-ranked G7 economy behind the US and remaining a middle-ranking country. Canada, Italy and Japan were ranked lower than the UK, according to a measure of output per hour. In a report titled Climbing the Summit: Big Cities in the UK and G7, the thinktank said London was flagging as a consistent provider of income and wealth to the rest of the nation, leaving other cities even more exposed. It urged the next government to focus on a broader investment programme to help consolidate digital industries in regional cities. Andrew Carter, the thinktank\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe message for policymakers is to take note of why the US, France and Germany perform so much better than the UK. While not the exclusive reason, a major part of this is the success of their big cities. \u201cThe size of cities like Manchester and Birmingham means they should have an advantage in attracting cutting-edge businesses. This is exactly what cities like Chicago, Munich and Lyon do, offering access to skilled workers, high-quality office space and \u2018spillover\u2019 benefits from neighbouring firms.\u201d Carter said ministers should give cities the power to physically expand, allowing them to build attractive suburbs near public transport links. These areas could attract businesses and especially firms with high levels of pay that export their services, such as finance, graphic design, marketing, software and publishing. The report said \u201curban areas where more clustering of knowledge happens tend to be more productive\u201d. In 2022, a measure of G7 productivity as a proportion of annual national income ranked the UK as fourth behind the US, Germany and France. UK productivity was about 16% below the US and Germany. \u201cThere are 112 cities in the G7 the size of Nottingham or larger, but of the bottom twenty for productivity, seven are British. They are in effect the sick men of the G7, with the recent stuttering of London adding to the UK\u2019s woes,\u201d the report said. A ranking of cities with service industries that rely on staff with digital skills found the UK was the lowest of the G7. The G7 summit takes place in the city of Fasano from Thursday to Saturday. Last year Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, scrapped the northern leg of the HS2 high-speed rail project between Birmingham and Manchester in a move seen as a setback to efforts to level up the economic imbalance between the south-east of England and other parts of the UK. In a submission to parliament, the thinktank said: \u201cIf the goal is to improve the economic performance of the North then it will only be successful if HS2 is treated as a small part of a broader package of investment. \u201cThe focus should be on investment in the skills of local populations via FE [further education] colleges and spending on transport within cities.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-18T04:00:04Z",
            "content": "Jeremy Hunt said Liz Truss\u2019s economic ambitions were a \u201cgood thing to aim for\u201d and her disastrous mini-budget hadn\u2019t left an impact on the economy, according to two leaked recordings obtained by the Guardian. The chancellor was recorded at a meeting of students when he said he was \u201ctrying to basically achieve some of the same things\u201d as the former prime minister, but that he was doing it \u201cmore gradually\u201d. In a sign of desperation the chancellor, who is fighting to hold on to his Surrey seat, separately told a local hustings event: \u201cI speak tonight as Jeremy Hunt\u201d, adding: \u201cI\u2019m not always going to take the government line.\u201d Hunt praised Truss for \u201caccepting the mistakes she\u2019d made with good grace\u201d and repeatedly refused to accept her plans had left a long-term impact on the economy. When pressed on whether he thought the country was currently battling negative effects, he said: \u201cNo I don\u2019t think it\u2019s had an effect. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the main cause.\u201d Labour said the remarks showed that the Conservatives had an \u201caddiction to dangerous Trussonomics\u201d. Hunt took over as chancellor after Truss sacked Kwasi Kwarteng in an attempt to save her premiership following the mini-budget, which proposed a \u00a345bn package of tax cuts, including the abolition of the top (45p) rate of income tax. He reversed a number of the key measures in the budget in order to stabilise the markets, leading to him being described as the country\u2019s de facto prime minister, and Truss was forced out 10 days later on 20 October 2022. His refusal to acknowledge the impact Truss\u2019s mini-budget made is in stark contrast to comments from Rishi Sunak. The prime minister has said that \u201ctwo years ago I wasn\u2019t afraid to repeatedly warn about what her economic policies would lead to\u201d. The Conservative manifesto offers another 2p off national insurance contributions (NICs), a gradual phasing out of self-employed NICs, a cut to stamp duty, higher thresholds for child benefit and a tax break for pensioners. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cThe Tories can pretend otherwise but this is who they are. When the door is closed and the cameras are off it all comes out \u2013 the same addiction to dangerous Trussonomics. \u201cLiz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget and unfunded tax cuts unleashed misery on millions by sending mortgage rates soaring. Now the chancellor admits he is trying to implement these policies by stealth, without the British public realising.\u201d Speaking at a meeting of the Oxford University Conservatives on 9 May, Hunt was asked about his own pledges on low tax made in his leadership campaign and Truss\u2019s claims to have been blocked by the civil service and other economic institutions, and whether he faced \u201cthe same kind of opposition\u201d. In a recording of the exchange, Hunt can be heard to say, to some laughter, that Truss \u201cappointed me as chancellor \u2026 you know, I want to be respectful of that fact. But I think the issue with most of the policies wasn\u2019t that they weren\u2019t a good thing to aim for\u201d. He said Truss \u201cdidn\u2019t explain in that mini-budget how she was to fund [her tax cuts]. And so markets thought that we were just basically going to fund all these tax cuts by massively increasing borrowing. And they took fright.\u201d The chancellor said he hoped to \u201cbasically achieve some of the same things that she wanted to achieve. But I\u2019m doing it more gradually because I\u2019m demonstrating at every stage that this is consistent with keeping borrowing under control. So, it\u2019s taking longer to get there, but I think it\u2019s obviously in a way we can actually deliver it.\u201d The recordings emerged as the chancellor came under fire for comments in a newsletter to constituents in which he wrote that tax cuts in the Conservative manifesto would be funded by savings from \u201can enormous back-to-work programme (which I announced in the autumn statement last year)\u201d. Labour said it showed the Conservatives were double-counting welfare cuts in order to fund tax cuts. The party intends to use this week\u2019s campaigning to put the spotlight on the Conservatives\u2019 economic record. During a visit to Southampton on Monday, Keir Starmer accused Hunt of making \u201ccompletely unfunded\u201d promises. He said: \u201cWhat has emerged this morning is truly extraordinary because what you\u2019ve got is no less than the chancellor admitting that the money that they were pretending was available in their manifesto for their desperate policies is in fact money that\u2019s already been accounted for. \u201cSo that means you\u2019ve got a manifesto from the Tories which isn\u2019t worth the paper on which it is written because it is completely unfunded. It is extraordinary \u2013 the fact that it has come from the chancellor I think makes it even more extraordinary. The money isn\u2019t there, that\u2019s the major problem.\u201d The Conservatives said the savings they intended to use to fund tax cuts would come from new policies. \u201cThe measures to achieve \u00a312bn in welfare savings had not been announced at the time of the last OBR forecast so the entire premise of his [Starmer\u2019s] latest press conference is redundant,\u201d a spokesperson said. Hunt, whose Godalming and Ash constituency is a target seat for the Liberal Democrats, also seemed to suggest at the hustings that HS2 shouldn\u2019t have been cancelled. Responding to a local Tory member who said scrapping HS2 \u201csends out the wrong signal\u201d, Hunt said: \u201cI think when parliament has decided democratically we\u2019re going to do these things and we pass an act of parliament we need to find a way of making them happen.\u201d A Conservative spokesperson said: \u201cThis is nonsense and takes the Chancellor\u2019s words out of context entirely. \u201cWe want to lower the tax burden and boost growth, and that\u2019s exactly what we have done with our fully-funded tax cuts and inflation returning to normal levels\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 June 2024. An earlier version said that, among the sweeping tax cuts proposed in Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s September 2022 budget was a \u201ccut to the top rate of income tax\u201d; in fact, the plan was to abolish the top (45p) rate. This has been corrected."

            "date": "2024-06-14T16:31:44Z",
            "content": "France\u2019s stock market is heading for its biggest weekly fall in more than two years, amid fears that the country\u2019s far-right party could win the upcoming parliamentary elections. French bonds were also hammered this week, as analysts warned of the risk of a Liz Truss-style market panic following Emmanuel Macron\u2019s shock decision last Sunday to call snap national assembly elections. The CAC 40 index of the largest 40 stocks listed in Paris has had its worst week since March 2022. It fell by 2.7% on Friday, taking its losses for the week to over 6%. Friday\u2019s selloff came after France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, warned that the country could risk a financial crisis if either the far right or left won the coming parliamentary election, because of their heavy spending pledges. \u201cWhen I look at the far right, I see a programme that is made of lies,\u201d Le Maire told franceinfo radio. The far-right National Rally party, led by Marine Le Pen, has previously called for protectionist economic policies and proposed higher public spending, as well as lower VAT on fuel, electricity and gas. Le Maire also claimed that a new alliance of left-wing parties would cause \u201ceconomic collapse\u201d if it won power. France is aiming to bring down its budget deficit to 3% by 2027, to meet the maximum borrowing allowed under eurozone rules. Increased government spending, or tax cuts, could undermine that push. Asked whether the current political instability could lead to a financial crisis, Le Maire said \u201cyes\u201d. \u201cThis is because of the political programmes that are on the table with regard to the question if we will be able, yes or no, to keep financing this debt,\u201d he added. The gap between France and Germany\u2019s borrowing costs has widened to a seven-year high this week, as investors sold French bonds \u2013 pushing down prices, which lifted the yield, or interest rate, on the debt. This spread measures the premium that investors demand for lending to Paris, rather than the traditional safe haven of Berlin. The last time this gap was wider was in 2017, shortly before Macron defeated Le Pen in the presidential elections that year. A poll this week showed that National Rally was on track to win the snap election and claim a third of the vote, ahead of France\u2019s leftwing bloc, which is forecast to take 22%, and Macron\u2019s centrists with 19% of the vote. Heavy losses for centrist candidates would almost certainly spell the end of Macron\u2019s pro-growth reforms, warned Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank. A hung parliament could lead to gridlock, he said. \u201cHowever, if Le Pen calls the shots in parliament and pursues major parts of her expensive fiscal and protectionist \u2018France first\u2019 agenda, the result could be a Liz Truss-style financial crisis. At the moment, we rate this as a serious risk, not as a forecast,\u201d Schmieding added. If National Rally won power in the French National Assembly, France would be in a \u201ccohabitation\u201d scenario; Macron would remain president and Jordan Bardella of National Rally would probably become prime minister."

            "content": "Time to recap\u2026 France\u2019s stock market has become the least favourite in Europe, according to a poll of fund managers by Bank of America. Goldman Sachs has warned that a victory for Marine Le Pen\u2019s party in France\u2019s elections would trigger a surge in the national debt. HSBC\u2019s Swiss private bank failed to conduct proper checks on $300m worth of funds sent between Lebanon and Switzerland during a period of 13 years, Switzerland\u2019s banking regulator has said. The board of Hargreaves Lansdown is willing to back a takeover offer from a private equity consortium that would value the UK\u2019s largest investment site at \u00a35.4bn. US retail sales barely rose in May, suggesting that economic activity remained lackluster. HSBC has said the money laundering breaches raised by Swiss regulator FINMA today (see here) were \u201chistoric\u201d. The bank added: \u201cHSBC takes its anti-money laundering obligations very seriously including complying with all laws and regulations in every market we operate in.\u201d HSBC is planning to appeal the decision and so would not be commenting further. Investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown has received a new takeover proposal from a group of private equity buyers, worth \u00a35.4bn. This revised proposal follows three previous approaches in recent months from a consortium of CVC Advisers Limited, Nordic Capital and Platinum Ivy of Abu Dhabi. They are now proposing to pay 1,140p per Hargreaves Lansdown share in cash, up from the 985p/share offer which was rejected in April. Hargreaves Lansdown board says it is willing to recommend this new proposal unanimously to shareholders, if a firm offer is made, and will provide the consortium with access to carry out due diligence work. Shares in Hargreaves Lansdown have jumped 5%, to \u00a311.27. Goldman Sachs\u2019 warning that a far-right government could drive up France\u2019s national debt (see here) comes at a politically sensitive time. Tomorrow, the European Commission is expected to name and shame EU members who have failed to keep to its budget rules, to aim for annual deficits of 3% and debt at 60% of GDP. France (which ran a deficit of 5.5% of GDP last year, and a debt of 110.6%) could easily fall foul of the excessive deficit procedure, which could potentially lead to a fine. France has long got away with breaching the eurozone\u2019s budget rules, granted a laxity that southern European members could only dream of. But with Marine Le Pen\u2019s party riding high in the polls, the European establishment may take a tougher line. As Politico puts it: After all, it\u2019s one thing to let off a pro-EU, statesmanlike leader for the type of reckless spending that endangers the economic stability of the eurozone. It\u2019s quite another if it\u2019s carried out brazenly by a nationalist firebrand who doesn\u2019t think the rules are worth the paper they\u2019re written on in the first place. \u201cIf an irresponsible [French spending] plan was put on the table, and the Commission said \u2018no problem,\u2019 then the whole fiscal framework is lost,\u201d said Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow at Brussels\u2019 influential think tank Bruegel, referring to the way the EU\u2019s executive arm gets to run the rule over governments\u2019 budgets. \u201cOther populist parties would forever disregard the rules.\u201d Wall Street isn\u2019t spooked by the weaker-than-expected US retail sales figures. Stock futures have moved a little higher, while the yield (or interest rate) on US government debt has fallen (showing that prices have risen). Poor economic news could be good for the markets, if it prompts the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates soon\u2026. Just in: US retail sales rose more slowly than forecast last month. Retail and food services sales across the US rose by 0.1% in May, following a downwardly revised 0.2% fall in April. On an annual basis, retail sales were 2.3% higher than in May 2023, a slowdown on the 2.7% rise recorded in April. This may indicate that demand across the US weakened last month, with consumers weighed down by high interest rates. Michael Brown, analyst at Pepperstone, says the report is a further sign that the \u2018US exceptionalism\u2019 narrative has likely run its course. \u201cThe May US retail sales report points to further signs of fatigue for the US consumer, with headline sales rising by a meagre 0.1% MoM, up from a downwardly revised 0.2% decline in the prior month.\u201d France\u2019s national debt could surge higher if Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally (RN) party wins an absolute majority in the national assembly elections, Goldman Sachs has warned. Goldman predicts that, if in power, the far-right would deliver a sizeable fiscal expansion, sending France\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio up to 120% by 2027. That highlights why France has turned into the most unloved European equity market (see earlier post). In contrast, under\u201d \u201ca status quo electoral outcome\u201d, debt would stabilise at 113% of GDP in 2027, Goldman estimates. And if France is left with a hung parliament that does not allow any political group to pass meaningful tax or spending measures, debt could rise to 116% of GDP. Goldman points out that political groups have started to outline their economic policy platforms: On labour market reforms, both the left coalition and the far-right oppose the 2023 pension reform, which raised the retirement age. More recently, however, far-right leader Jordan Bardella stated that revisiting the pension system would not be a \u201cnear-term priority\u201d and rather would come at a \u201clater stage.\u201d On taxes, both the left coalition and the far-right support cutting VAT on energy and food, as well as re-introducing a wealth tax. At the same time, the current government and the centre-right have pledged not to increase taxes on corporates and households. France has made some progress in lowering its public debt in recent years; in 2023 it was 110.6% of GDP, according to statistics body INSEE, down from 114.9% in 2020. Goldman also warns that the current \u201congoing episode of political uncertainty\u201d could hurt the French fiscal outlook, if it leads to higher borrowing costs for Paris. French supermarket giant Carrefour is not sharing in today\u2019s stock market recovery. Shares in Carrefour have tumbled by over 7%, following reports that France\u2019s finance ministry has asked a court to fine the retailer over contracts with franchisee stores that it says were unbalanced in its favour. Carrefour contested the ministry\u2019s \u201cgrievances\u201d, saying it was intervening in a dispute that began several months ago without providing new information on the merits, and that it had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in its ability to demonstrate the validity of its contracts, Reuters reports. Despite falling in investors\u2019 affections, the French stock market is a little sttonger today. The CAC 40 index is 0.33% higher today, gaining 25 points to 7,596 points. Germany\u2019s DAX has gained 0.15% while the Italian FTSE MIB has gained 1%. Lee Hardman, senior FX strategist at MUFG, says: \u201cMarkets have been settling down after last week\u2019s moves in French government bonds and we have had some comments from [Marine] Le Pen saying she was respectful of institutions. Today\u2019s UK insolvency statistics also show there was surge in retail failures this spring. Wholesale and retail trade insolvencies increased by 27% month-on-month in April to 355, up from 280 in March, and were 30% higher than in April 2023. We learned a month ago that overall insolvencies rose by 17% in April, but today we have more details (as well as the top-line data for May). Gordon Thomson, restructuring partner at leading audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK, says: \u201cThe tough trading environment for the retail sector continues to drag on, resulting in an increase in insolvencies in April. As retailers grapple with high costs, lacklustre consumer demand and too many April showers, they were also hit with an increase in national minimum wage which may have been the final straw for some. \u201cHowever, with inflation easing, real wages growing, and interest rates set to come down, this bodes well for consumer confidence and sets the stage for an increase in consumer spending in the second half of the year. For those retailers that have managed to weather the storm thus far, there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel. Just in: HSBC\u2019s private bank has been blocked from taking on any politically exposed people as clients in Switzerland, after violating Swiss money laundering regulations. Swiss financial regulator FINMA has announced that HSBC \u201cseriously violated financial market law\u201d in its handling of high-risk business relationships with two politically exposed people. HSBC failed to carry out an adequate check of either the origins, purpose or background of the assets involved, FINMA says. The regulator explains: The transactions in question were carried out between 2002 and 2015 and amounted to a total of more than $300m. The funds, which originated from a government institution, were transferred from Lebanon to Switzerland and \u2013 generally after a short time \u2013 primarily flowed back to other accounts in Lebanon. FINMA says HSBC closed these business relationships in 2016, but did not file a report with the Money Laundering Reporting Office until 2020. FINMA has ordered HSBC to review its anti-money laundering aspects, adding: The bank may not enter into any new business relationships with politically exposed persons until such time as completion of the reviews has been confirmed by the audit agent. A strike at Dounreay nuclear power station has been postponed at the last minute, after workers were offered an improved pay deal. Around 600 workers, employed by Nuclear Restoration Services Limited (NRS), had been due to strike on Wednesday, in a pay dispute. The Unite union says the action has been suspended \u201cas a sign of good faith\u201d to allow workers to be balloted on a new pay offer. Staff had previously rejected a pay increase of 4.5% plus a one-off \u00a3500 payment, the union says. Unite adds that an overtime ban and an end to working voluntary appointments will continue during the ballot process. If the new offer is rejected by the membership, fresh strike action will be announced. Bank of America\u2019s survey was carried out between June 7 to June 13, which covered much of last week\u2019s stock market tumble in France. As Bloomberg reminds us: \u2026[last week] France\u2019s CAC 40 Index fell the most since in over two years and wiped out $258bn in market capitalization. Investors are anxious about the French national assembly elections because there is a high probability that no party will win an overall majority. Campaigning for the election began yesterday, when a poll of voting intentions showed that Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party currently has 33% support in the first round of the French legislative election, while an alliance of left-wing parties would get 28%. Analysts at UBS suggests there are four possible scenarios for how the elections could play out: Scenario 1: Rassemblement National (RN) with Absolute Majority. This would allow RN to appoint a prime minister and comfortably pass laws, though internal government dissension could pose challenges. The RN\u2019s policies focus on new spending for pensioners and household purchasing power, funded by controlling social spending linked to immigration. Scenario 2: RN with Relative Majority. RN could become the largest party but with less than 289 seats, leading to a complex cohabitation. With the president appointing a prime minister from RN. This scenario would likely result in political deadlock and limited policy changes. Scenario 3: Front Populaire with Relative Majority. The left-wing coalition could win a relative majority, leading to a similar cohabitation scenario with potential deadlock. Their manifesto includes undoing recent pension and unemployment reforms and increasing spending on pensions and purchasing power. Scenario 4: Renaissance 2.0. Macron\u2019s party could maintain a relative majority, continuing to face challenges in passing laws without forming alliances. Macron\u2019s policies would focus on household purchasing power and competitiveness, partially funded by labor reforms and localauthority savings. Bank of America\u2019s Fund Manager Survey also found that global investors remained bullish in June, although inflation remains a top worry. France has turned into the most unloved European equity market, as political uncertainty spooks investors, according to a regular poll from Bank of America. BofA\u2019s European Fund Manager Survey found that investors have grown gloomier about Europe\u2019s growth prospects, partly due to the looming French elections. A net 43% of respondents expect stronger European growth over the coming twelve months, down from 61% last month, which was the highest since July 2021. Enthusiasm has probably been tempered by \u201crising French political and economic policy uncertainty\u201d, BofA says, along with rising predictions that the US economy will slow and China\u2019s growth will soften. This gloominess has prompted a rotation into defensive stocks, and out of those which benefit from a cyclical upturn. BofA adds: France has turned into investors\u2019 most unloved European equity market, having been the most preferred last month, while Spain is the biggest favourite. Data from Bloomberg yesterday showed that London had regained its crown as Europe\u2019s biggest stock market from Paris. Overnight, US electric car maker Fisker filed for bankruptcy protection, and hopes to sell its assets, after struggling to challenge Tesla in the EV market. Fisker has filed for Chapter 11 protection in the District of Delaware, after failing to find a rescue, three months after suspending all manufacture of its electric vehicles. Fisker suffered a rapid cash burn as it tried to roll out its Ocean SUV cars in the US and Europe. A Fisker spokesperson says: \u201cFisker has made incredible progress since our founding, bringing the Ocean SUV to market twice as fast as expected in the auto industry and making good on our promises to deliver the most sustainable vehicle in the world. \u201cWe are proud of our achievements, and we have put thousands of Fisker Ocean SUVs in customers\u2019 hands in both North American and Europe. But like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic headwinds that have impacted our ability to operate efficiently. After evaluating all options for our business, we determined that proceeding with a sale of our assets under Chapter 11 is the most viable path forward for the company.\u201d Fisker had tried to keep its costs down by using Austrian contract manufacturer, Magna Steyr, to build its car in Graz. The company was founded by Danish automotive designer Henrik Fisker, who had previously designed luxury cars for BMW, Ford, and Aston Martin, such as BMW\u2019s Z8 roadster and the Aston Martin DB9 and Vantage cars. Just in: We have confirmation that inflation across the eurozone accelerated last month. The euro area annual inflation rate was 2.6% in May 2024, up from 2.4% in April, statistics body Eurostat reports \u2013 confirming its flash estimate at the end of May. That takes inflation away from the 2% target set by the European Central Bank, which cut interest rates two weeks ago. Core inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco, rose to 2.9% from 2.7% (which also matches the initial estimate). Investors are now pondering how soon the ECB might cut interest rates for a second time this year. Governing council member Boris Vujcic warned yesterday that an interest rate cut in September would require an improvement in the ECB\u2019s inflation outlook. Vujcic explained: \u201cIn order to do more, we need to see more. Any prolongation of the inflation conversion toward the medium-term target weakens the case for an interest-rate cut, and vice versa.\u201d David Hudson, restructuring advisory partner at FRP, warns that many firms are still in a \u201cperilous state of limbo\u201d, despite the slowdown in insolvencies last month: \u201cInsolvency levels appear to be stabilising, however many businesses still find themselves in a perilous state of limbo. Economic growth has stagnated after a positive couple of months while many investment decisions remain on pause as we await predicted interest rate cuts and the outcome of the general election \u2013 a particular risk in sectors like construction where purdah can stall planning decisions. In this environment, more will continue to falter, and we\u2019re anticipating seeing the profile of those exposed shifting to larger companies \u2013 the impact of which will be felt keenly across supply chains. The future of many will be dependent on a stronger second half to the year, with greater economic and political certainty stimulating demand as well as falling input costs.\u201d The number of UK individuals and businesses falling into insolvency has slowed, as pressures from rising costs ease. Official data shows that 9,266 individuals entered insolvency across England &amp; Wales in May, a 4% drop compared with April (but also 3% more than a year ago). The Insolvency Service reports there were 604 bankruptcies, 3,716 debt relief orders (DROs) and 4,946 individual voluntary arrangements (IVAs). DROs are available to those on low incomes, and will freeze, then wipe out, existing debts up to \u00a330,000 on, for example, council tax, rent and energy bills. Their popularity has risen since a \u00a390 fee was scrapped. Company insolvencies fell by 6% in May, month-on-month, in England and Wales to 2,006, which is 21% lower than in May 2023. Benjamin Wiles, managing director at Kroll, says the pace of insolvencies seems to be easing: \u201cCompared to this time last year, we are seeing a pickup in business activity with key indicators showing improving consumer and business confidence. While I think it\u2019s fair to say that we aren\u2019t quite out of the woods, compared to twelve months ago when businesses were managing unpredictable cost inflation and energy bills, it does feel there\u2019s now a lot more certainty for companies to plan. Interestingly, businesses we speak to are also coming to terms with higher borrowing costs \u2013 though there is evidence that some lenders are extending finance rather than restructuring debt. \u201cCompany administrations that we track are up year-on-year, but it does seem the pace of insolvencies are easing. There are some sectors including manufacturing and media and tech, which are continuing to see big increases, but overall it\u2019s now a smaller trickle than a tidal wave.\u201d Iceland\u2019s chairman, Richard Walker, says Kantar are correct that the cost of living squeeze isn\u2019t over \u2013 before squeezing in a plug for his supermarket: Back in January, Walker (a former Conservative supporter) announced he was backing Labour, saying Keir Starmer understood how the cost of living crisis has put an \u201cunbearable strain\u201d on families. The chair of Toyota has been re-elected despite opposition from two prominent shareholder advisors amid a scandal over vehicle testing and falsified emissions data. Akio Toyoda, grandson of the Japanese carmaker\u2019s founder, is expected to have won a reduced share of votes at the annual shareholder meeting after ISS and Glass Lewis, two companies that recommend how investors should vote, advised a vote against him. The full results of the vote will not be known until Wednesday. The advisors\u2019 governance concerns centre on Toyota\u2019s Daihatsu subsidiary, which acknowledged problems with its crash safety testing last year. The company also admitted in 2022 that truckmaking subsidiary Hino falsified emissions data. The backing for Toyoda came after the company made strong profits. It has benefited from strong demand for hybrid electric cars, which combine a petrol engine with a battery. Some analysts are concerned that the company has been slower than rivals in Europe and particularly in China to adopt pure electric vehicle technology, but in the short term the hybrid strategy appears to have paid off in profits. The vote has also been closely watched by analysts who believe that Japan is starting a new era of more assertive shareholder activism, rather than a compliant investor base which was perceived as rarely challenging business leaders in the past. Guy Lawson-Johns, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, an investment platform, said: Most of the opposition to Toyoda is expected to have come from overseas investors, part of a broader wave of shareholder capitalism hitting Japan. Whitbread (who we covered in the introduction) are the top rise on the FTSE 100 share index in early trading. Whitbread\u2019s shares have jumped by 4.5%, as investors welcome the news that UK trading strengthened over the last quarter. Retail analyst Nick Bubb says: Well, grocery price inflation is not what it used to be, but it\u2019s still a surprise to see Kantar report that the supermarket sector saw only 1.0% sales growth in the latest 4 week period\u2026 Within the sector, Ocado was the fastest growing grocer for the fourth month in a row, increasing sales by 10.7% over the 12 weeks to 9 June. Tesco\u2019s sales were up 4.6% over the last 12 weeks, taking its market share to 27.7% \u2013 the highest market share since February 2022, while Sainsbury\u2019s market share rose to 15.2%. Discount retailer Lidl grew its market share to 8.1%, while rival Aldi has 10% of the market. Morrisons sales rose by 1.1%. giving a share of 8.7%, while Iceland\u2019s sales rose 4.4%, giving it 2.4% of the market. Kantar reports that take-home grocery sales rose by just 1.0% over the four weeks to 9 June 2024, which is the the slowest increase since June 2022. That\u2019s partly due to the slowdown in inflation (as prices rose at a slower rate), but also the poor weather in May and June. Kantar says the sixth wettest spring on record has hurt the grocery sector too, with much less demand for summer items such as suncream. Instead, we\u2019ve been buying more soup! Kantar\u2019s Fraser McKevitt explains: We\u2019re not yet reaching for those typical summertime products and are making some purchases you wouldn\u2019t expect in June. Consumers bought nearly 25% fewer suncare items this month compared with last year, while prepared salads dipped by 11%. On the other hand, warming fresh soup sales jumped by almost 24%. Kantar\u2019s grocery inflation data will tee up tomorrow\u2019s official UK inflation measure \u2013 due at 7am on Wednesday. City economists predict the UK consumer prices index could slow to 2%. That would mean inflation would, finally, be back to the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, for the first time since July 2021. Newsflash: UK grocery inflation has fallen for the 16th month in a row. Data firm Kantar reports that supermarket prices are 2.1% higher than a year ago this month, a slowdown on the 2.4% annual rise recorded in early May. Kantar reports that prices are now falling in nearly one third of the grocery categories it tracks, such as toilet tissues, butter and milk. This slowdown in price rises should bring some relief to households, who were hit by grocery inflation of 17% in March 2023. But Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, warns that the squeeze on budgets isn\u2019t over. \u201cThe cost-of-living crisis isn\u2019t over \u2013 far from it. 22% of households say they\u2019re struggling, meaning that they aren\u2019t able to cover their expenses or are just making ends meet. \u201cHowever, there are positive signs that many of us no longer feel the need to restrict our spending quite so much, with lower inflation helping to ease the pressure on people\u2019s pockets.\u201d The Unite union has also supplied a report from an unnamed Whitbread worker, who says staff are worried about its plans for 1,500 job cuts. The anonymous Whitbread worker says: We are still only being drip fed information with little to no time to process or evaluate options. \u201cThe collective consultation process seems to have mostly dismissed any ideas put forward by our reps making everything look like it is just a tick box exercise to try and cover Whitbread against any legal backlash. \u201cI feel I can speak for quite a few people when I say we\u2019re all scared of what is coming. There are people out there not only losing their jobs but their homes too and there is little to no support from head office. We are now sat counting down the weeks wondering what will happen.\u201d Whitbread also owns several restaurant chains, including Beefeater, Brewers Fayre and Bar + Block. It reports today that its total food and beverage sales (which fell 1% year-on-year) were boosted by strong breakfast sales driven by high occupancy at its hotels. However, that was offset by softer trading in \u201ca number of our branded restaurants\u201d, Whitbread says (a sign that cash-strapped customers are cutting back on eating out, perhaps?). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The hotel sector can be a good gauge of economic confidence, tracking whether people are splashing out for trips away and if firms are stumping up for business trips. And this morning, Premier Inn owner Whitbread has reported that recent trading in the UK has been \u201cmore encouraging\u201d, as it prepares to face union anger over plans to cut 1,500 jobs. The company says it remains \u201cconfident in the full year outlook\u201d, after growing total sales by 1% to \u00a3739m, \u201cdriven by improved UK trading and continued progress in Germany\u201d. In its latest financial results, Whitbread reports that sales growth was flat (0%) in the UK for the 13 weeks to 30 May 2024, although it did grow by 15% in Germany (where trading had been weaker). That 0% figure, though, hides a pick-up after a weak start to the first quarter of Whitbread\u2019s financial year. The company told shareholders: Having been 1% behind last year in the first seven weeks, our trading performance strengthened during the remainder of the quarter and accommodation sales recovered to be in line with last year and up 55% versus FY20. But, on a like-for-like basis, accommodation sales shrank by 2%, along with a 1% drop in food &amp; beverage sales. Whitbread reports that midweek business demand and peak leisure demand both remain \u201crobust\u201d, however last-minute demand for weekend stays has been \u201cslightly softer\u201d, particularly in London. Perhaps the post-pandemic surge in trips away has faded? Back in April, Whitbread reported strong results for the last financial year, including a 13% rise in sales in the year to 29 February. Whitbread also says net inflation is now expected to be at the lower end of its guidance as a result of \u201cincreased cost efficiencies\u201d. The company, and its shareholders, will feel the wrath of the Unite union later today when they gather for its annual general meeting at its offices in Dunstable, Bedfordshire. Unite are planning a protest over Whitbread\u2019s plans, announced in April, to cut 1,500 jobs. The union says Whitbread have refused to consult with them, or answer basic questions on the redundancy process. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \u201cRarely is a company so shameless as to celebrate leaping profits and dividends by announcing mass job cuts. \u201cBut generating runaway profits while trampling workers is business as usual for Whitbread. This is a firm that refuses to pay the real living wage and does not even provide company sick pay for its underpaid and overworked staff. \u201cUnite will be holding the company to account for its disgraceful race to the bottom behaviour and offering full support to our members impacted by these cruel and unnecessary redundancy plans.\u201d The agenda 8am BST: Kantar\u2019s grocery price inflation 10am BST: Eurozone inflation rate for May (final estimate) 10am BST: ZEW index of German economic sentiment 1pm BST: Unite protest ahead of Whitbread\u2019s AGM 1.30pm BST: US retail sales for May 2.30pm BST: Whitbread\u2019s AGM begins"

            "date": "2024-06-18T20:25:49Z",
            "content": "Nvidia became the world\u2019s most valuable company on Tuesday, overtaking tech heavyweight Microsoft, as its chips continue to play a central role in a race to dominate the market for artificial intelligence. Shares of the chipmaker climbed 3.5% to $135.58, lifting its market capitalization to $3.34tn, just days after overtaking the iPhone maker Apple to become the second most valuable company. Nvidia\u2019s rise has taken it from a company best known for producing video game chips into a global powerhouse. Its profits have surged amid the tech industry\u2019s immense shift towards artificial intelligence, which has left major companies seeking out Nvidia\u2019s products to serve as a backbone of the technology. The company\u2019s growth has outpaced other household names in the tech industry including Google and Apple, and has fueled a wave of investment and market speculation. Nvidia\u2019s latest climb boosted Wall Street to a fresh record high. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.3% to finish Tuesday at 5,487.03. The stock has surged about 180% so far this year, compared with a rise of about 19% in Microsoft shares, with demand for its top-of-the-line processors outpacing supply. Tech giants Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Google-owner Alphabet are racing to build out their AI-computing capabilities and dominate the emerging technology. The surge in shares pushed the stock to a record high, adding more than $103bn to Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization on Tuesday. Increasing the appeal for its highly valued stock among individual investors, Nvidia recently split its stock 10-for-one, effective 7 June. \u201cA stock split can reduce the price per share, making it more affordable for individual investors to buy. With Nvidia doing a 10-to-one stock split, retail investors are the real winners here,\u201d said Sam North, market analyst at investment platform eToro. Nvidia\u2019s chips power many of the AI industry\u2019s marquee tools, including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT chatbot. The company\u2019s rising stock price and increased prominence within the industry have made its earnings reports and announcements into destination events for Silicon Valley investors. Increased demand for its chips has also made the price per unit rise to about $30,000 and seen the company\u2019s revenue surge. As Nvidia\u2019s power within tech has grown, it has also vaulted the 61-year-old CEO, Jensen Huang, into the same rarified position as other industry titans and made him one of the world\u2019s richest men. Over the past year-and-a-half, his net worth has increased a staggering $93bn, making him worth more than $100bn in total. The company\u2019s market value expanded from $1tn to $2tn in just nine months in February, while taking just over three months to hit $3tn in June. Reuters contributed reporting"

            "date": "2024-06-07T20:10:58Z",
            "content": "\u201cCan y\u2019all hear me right now?\u201d Keith Gill began his broadcast. \u201cI kinda forget how to do this.\u201d Back in 2021, the influencer better known as Roaring Kitty led a crusade by retail traders which triggered the extraordinary surge in GameStop, an embattled video games chain \u2013 and left Wall Street scrambling. Gill became an internet star, and even testified to Congress about his bullish stance on the stock. Then he disappeared from view. For years after the turbulent stock market frenzy, Gill was silent online. Even as the story of his battle against the financial establishment was transformed into a Hollywood movie, he kept mum. A string of cryptic social media posts signaled last month that Roaring Kitty had awoken from his three-year nap, reigniting a volatile rally of GameStop shares. But they raised more questions than answers. When Gill resurfaced on YouTube on Friday, hundreds of thousands of viewers were waiting. Yet those who tuned in looking for clarity were in for a disappointing 50 minutes. Back in 2021, when shares in GameStop first soared, it was a loss-making enterprise, struggling to find its place in gaming\u2019s modern era. Three years later, it remained unprofitable in the first quarter, struggling to find its place in gaming\u2019s modern era. Its latest earnings, released shortly before Roaring Kitty went live, outlined a sharp drop in sales since the start of the year. GameStop also confirmed plans to sell up to 75m more shares, capitalizing on its stock\u2019s latest jump. \u201cThe Company will not be holding a conference call today,\u201d GameStop said in a brief press release, offering no explanation for its weak results. Its shares tanked by as much as a quarter, and trading was repeatedly halted. The retailer was unprepared to address the market, but one diehard believer was happy to oblige. Gill reappeared with his arm in a sling, a bandage on his head, plasters on his face and sunglasses. A life support machine could be heard in the background, before he pretended to die. \u201cOh shit, that was a close call,\u201d he laughed, thanking viewers for bringing him back to life. GameStop\u2019s share price, however \u2013 shown live in the background \u2013 was looking anything but healthy. Gill was keen to dispel the rumors. \u201cThis is me, by the way,\u201d he said, stressing that he was, indeed, in control of his trading and social media accounts, and not working with anyone else. So why the comeback? There\u2019s \u201cno real gameplan\u201d, clarified Gill, despite speculation he might provide new information to explain his confidence in a declining retailer. Instead, he rambled about movie memes, played with a Magic 8 Ball and thanked followers for their well-wishes ahead of his birthday. \u201cIt\u2019s been a few years now. I hope you all are good,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty good to be back, y\u2019know?\u201d Far from revelation, Gill delivered a reiteration of his longstanding belief that GameStop\u2019s management would, one day, somehow, revitalize the chain.

            "date": "2024-06-18T13:40:57Z",
            "content": "Political ripples from the supreme court\u2019s decision to overturn a Trump White House-era ban on sales of \u201cbump stocks\u201d \u2013 a spring-loaded stock that uses recoil to in effect turn a semi-automatic firearm into a machine gun \u2013 continued to radiate on Monday when Jacky Rosen took exception to comments on the issue made by his Republican colleague JD Vance. Vance, the Ohio senator and potential vice-presidential pick as Trump seeks a second presidency in November had dismissed efforts by senior Democrats, including Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, to pass legislation banning the devices as \u201ca huge distraction\u201d. Vance went further. \u201cWhat is the real gun violence problem in this country, and are we legislating in a way that solves fake problems? Or solves real problems?\u201d Vance said, before adding: \u201cMy very strong suspicion is that the Schumer legislation is aimed at a PR problem, not something that\u2019s going to meaningfully reduce gun violence in this country.\u201d Rosen, the Democratic senator, hit back, facing re-election this year in politically purple Nevada, the site of the 2017 Las Vegas concert shooting that killed 58 and prompted Trump to ban the rapid-fire device. \u201cThis is not a fake problem,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cLet him come to Las Vegas. Let him see the memorial for those people who died. Let him talk to those families. It\u2019s not a fake problem. Those families are dead.\u201d Rosen said Las Vegas, the gambling mecca and major source of Nevada\u2019s revenue, had been \u201cchanged forever because of what the shooter did, and the bump stocks helped him\u201d. She invited Vance to visit memorials to the victims as well as to talk to first responders. \u201cShame on him,\u201d Rosen added, visibly enraged. \u201cShame on him for disrespecting the dead.\u201d In its ruling last week, the conservative majority on the supreme court ruled that the executive branch of government did not have the power to use existing firearms laws to prohibit bump stocks. But the justices allowed legislators to pass new laws banning the accessory. Schumer and other senior Democrats have since said they would quickly move to do so. Outcry from Democrats mounted after Vance reasoned that a bill to ban bump stocks would \u201cend up just inhibiting the rights of law-abiding Americans\u201d and mused about how many people would still have been killed if the heavily armed video poker player Stephen Paddock had not outfitted his armory with the contested devices. \u201cHow many people would have been shot alternatively? And you have to ask yourself the question: will anyone actually not choose a bump stock because Chuck Schumer passes a piece of legislation?\u201d Vance said. After Vance made his comments, Schumer retorted: \u201cTalk to the people in Las Vegas who lost loved ones.\u201d The supreme court ruling gives both sides of the gun issue red meat for the election campaign, though it is complicated by the initial ban coming from the Trump White House. Lindsey Graham, the Republican South Carolina senator, told NBC News he will block the Democrats\u2019 measure. And Vance questioned Democrats\u2019 legislative priorities. Chris Murphy, the Democratic Connecticut senator who has championed tougher gun laws after the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in 2012, said Republicans in his chamber should have no problem voting for the measure banning bump stocks. \u201cIs it good politics to make it easier for potential mass killers to get their hands on machine guns? Probably not,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe idea is to try to make this attractive to Republicans. And we would be a lot better off if psychopaths couldn\u2019t get their hands on machine guns.\u201d Between Friday \u2013 when the supreme court\u2019s ruling on bump stocks returned gun control to the top of the national discourse \u2013 and Monday, there were 17 mass shootings reported across the US, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Among those was a shooting Saturday in Rochester Hills, Michigan, in which nine people \u2013 including two children \u2013 were wounded at a city-run splash pad that families frequent to cool off in the summer. Police said the attack was carried out at random by a gunman who later died by suicide. Another shooting on Saturday in Round Rock, Texas, saw 14 people wounded and two killed. There, the shooting erupted after an altercation between two groups of people \u2013 the victims were uninvolved bystanders, police said. The non-partisan Gun Violence Archive defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more victims are wounded or killed. There have been at least 230 such shootings reported in the US so far this year, a high rate which has fueled public calls for more substantial gun control but which Congress for the most part has not heeded.

            "content": "Spending in shops and online bounced back strongly last month as better weather, falling inflation and rising consumer confidence boosted spending. The monthly update from the Office for National Statistics showed the volume of retail sales rose by 2.9% in May, after a weather-affected drop of 1.8% in April. The ONS said most retailers had a better month in May, with marked increases in the clothing and footwear and household goods sectors. Clothing sales rose by 5.4% as retailers managed to shift summer stock. Kathleen Brooks, a research director at XTB, said the strength of clothing sales might have been influenced by one-off events. \u201cCould this be the Taylor Swift effect, with people \u2013 including myself \u2013 splurging on new outfits ahead of her Eras tour, the UK leg of which is set to add \u00a31bn to the UK economy?\u201d The official data followed the release of the latest snapshot of consumer confidence from GfK showing sentiment standing at its highest level in two and a half years. Over the three months to May \u2013 a better guide to the underlying trend in spending \u2013 retail sales rose by 1%. Even so, they remained 0.5% below the level immediately before the start of the Covid pandemic in February 2020. Retail sales account for less than half of total consumer spending and exclude categories such as car sales, eating out and hotel stays. The broader monthly health check on the economy by S&amp;P found the pace of growth eased in June after Rishi Sunak called a snap election. The S&amp;P purchasing managers\u2019 index showed activity was growing at its slowest pace in seven months, with the weakness concentrated in the service sector. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: \u201cFlash PMI survey data for June signal a slowing in the pace of economic growth, indicating that GDP is now growing at a sluggish quarterly rate of just over 0.1%. \u201cThe slowdown in part reflects uncertainty around the business environment in the lead-up to the general election, with many firms seeing a hiatus in decision-making pending clarity on various policies.\u201d The PMI composite output index fell from 53.0 in May to 51.7 in June. A reading above 50 indicates the economy is expanding rather than contracting. Rob Wood, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macro, said the fall in the PMI was an election-related blip. \u201cRetail sales rebounded strongly from April\u2019s rain-sodden disaster and will keep gaining ground as consumers\u2019 real wage growth drives higher spending. \u201cThe incessant rainfall didn\u2019t stop in May but precipitation was \u2018only\u2019 20% above average, compared to 68% above in April. May was also the warmest since at least 1884.\u201d Andrew Wishart, a senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the fact that online sales were up by 5.9% month on month suggested there was more to the May increase than simply better weather attracting shoppers back to high streets. \u201cOverall, the retail sales data for May showed tentative signs that strengthening real income growth now inflation is back at target is feeding through to stronger spending,\u201d Wishart said. Separate ONS figures highlighted the size of the fiscal challenge facing the next government, with the gap between public spending and tax receipts standing at \u00a315bn last month \u2013 \u00a3800m higher than a year earlier and the third highest for a May since modern records began in 1993. Spending last month was \u00a32.3bn higher than in May 2023, while a \u00a31.5bn increase in tax receipts was partly offset by weaker national insurance contributions after the cuts in the autumn statement and the budget. May\u2019s \u00a315bn borrowing figure was slightly lower than the \u00a315.7bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s spending watchdog. April\u2019s borrowing was revised down by \u00a32.1bn to \u00a318.4bn."

            "content": "UK savers are being urged to lock into an inflation-beating savings account before interest rates start their downward journey. A number of fixed-rate savings bonds currently pay 5%-plus \u2013 on these accounts your return is guaranteed and you will be earning more than twice the current rate of inflation. However, with most analysts expecting the first Bank of England base rate cut in August or September, followed by several more over the next year or two, the rates available right now may not hang around for long, some commenters claim. Mark Hicks, a savings expert at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cThis is a window of opportunity for savers, so now is the time to clamber in and grab a decent rate before it closes.\u201d Lucinda O\u2019Brien, of the comparison website money.co.uk, has a similar message: \u201cNow is the time to act, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Earlier this month it was announced that inflation measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) fell to 2% in May. It\u2019s a far cry from the period in 2022 and 2023 when inflation was running at 10% to 11%, eating into the value of millions of people\u2019s nest-eggs. Many of the highest-paying savings accounts offering a rate of 5%-plus are fixed-rate deals where you have to tie your money up for 12 months. At the time of writing, a number of players were offering one-year fixed-rate savings bonds paying 5.2% or more. These include the My Community Bank credit union and Union Bank of India (UK), both paying 5.22%; Vanquis Bank, offering 5.21%; and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.2%. These require a minimum deposit of \u00a31,000, except Close Brothers Savings, which requires \u00a310,000 to open an account. However, Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, says that while you can earn the most interest with a one-year fixed-rate account, \u201cyou would need to track down another fix when it matured [and] there\u2019s a decent chance the rates on offer by then will be significantly lower\u201d. This is why two-year fixed savings bonds are looking attractive, she says. \u201cYou could consider tying up any cash you don\u2019t need for two years, and making the most of the great rates while they\u2019re around.\u201d On Thursday, the highest-paying two-year fixed-rate savings bonds were those offered by Vanquis Bank and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.06% on minimum balances of \u00a31,000 and \u00a310,000 respectively. Other providers offering two-year fixed savings accounts boasting best-buy rates included Hodge Bank (4.97%), Market Harborough building society (4.95%), and Atom Bank (4.9%). The minimum deposits for these are \u00a31,000, \u00a310,000 and \u00a350 respectively. \u201cThis is a really sensible time to consider locking in a fixed rate,\u201d says Coles. She believes the Bank of England is not going to be in a hurry to cut rates, but they are likely to get progressively lower. \u201cBy the middle of next year [rates] are forecast to be 4.5%, and by the middle of 2026 they are expected to hit 4%.\u201d It is a good idea to review your savings rates anyway, if you have not done so during the past six to 12 months, says Rachel Springall, of the financial data provider Moneyfacts. Loyalty \u201cdoes not always pay\u201d, and the average easy-access account interest rate paid across the biggest high street banks is 2.01%, which is 0.05% less than it was six months ago, based on a snapshot of rates on 19 June."

            "content": "Australia\u2019s monthly inflation rate increased to its highest level in 2024 in the latest indication that the Reserve Bank won\u2019t be cutting interest rates soon and might yet hike again. Consumer prices rose 4% last month from a year earlier, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. That compared with the 3.6% pace recorded for April, and the 3.8% rate expected for May by economists. The jump in May\u2019s inflation was propelled in part by automotive fuel prices, which were up 9.3% from a year earlier even as they retreated 5.1% during the month itself. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Electricity prices were also up 6.5% from a year ago, quickening from April\u2019s 4.2% pace. Without the federal and state rebates, power prices would have been 14.5% higher. Food presented a mixed price picture. Overall prices were up 3.3% from May 2023, a slowdown from April\u2019s 3.8% pace. Fruit and vegetable prices, though, climbed 4.4% compared with May 2023, continuing a recent rebound after prices posted a 1.2% drop in March. Housing costs were 5.2% higher than in May 2023, with rents up 7.4%, reflecting the low vacancy rates in many cities. Of particular concern will be the acceleration of the trimmed mean measure of inflation, which is what the RBA looks at more closely than the \u201cheadline\u201d CPI figure. That jumped to 4.4% from 4.1% in April and 4% in March. The monthly inflation figures are less complete than the quarterly ones, which won\u2019t land until 31 July. The RBA expects the quarterly inflation pace will accelerate to 3.8% in the April-June period from 3.6% in the March quarter. The monthly consumer price index peaked in December 2022 at 8.4%, a three-decade high, as post-Covid government stimulus combined with higher global energy prices in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Urkaine. The RBA has said it won\u2019t hesitate to raise its key interest rate \u2013 for a 14th time in this cycle \u2013 if it loses confidence that inflation can fall back within its 2%-3% target by the end of next year. The federal budget, released earlier this month, forecast price increases could slow to 3% or less by the end of 2024. It is banking on energy rebates and other measures to \u201cmechanically\u201d lower the CPI even as the stage-three cuts inject more than $20bn into the economy this coming financial year. The Australian dollar jumped about US0.2 cents to almost US66.7 in the wake of the inflation figures as investors shifted their bets about interest rates. Stocks also shed about 0.3 percentage points, before paring the losses to be down about 0.75% for the day. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said inflation was \u201chigher than we would like\u201d, and much lower than 6.1% when Labor took office in May 2022. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen around the world that inflation can zig and zag on its way down, it doesn\u2019t always moderate in a straight line and the last mile can be a bit harder,\u201d Chalmers said. His shadow counterpart Angus Taylor said the inflation outcome was \u201cshocking but not surprising\u201d. \u201cThis is what happens when you have a big spending Labor government that\u2019s completely out of touch with the economic reality,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe\u2019ve now had four months in a row of accelerating core inflation. This will no doubt be of concern to the independent Reserve Bank.\u201d However, Steve Mickenbecker, an executive with Canstar, said the monthly inflation pop was \u201cstaggering\u201d, confirming that inflation was not on the downward trajectory sought by the RBA. The RBA will \u201csurely lift rates\u201d when its board meets in on 5-6 August because \u201cthe risk of baked-in inflationary expectations is too high\u201d, Mickenbecker said. \u201cIt\u2019s worrying news for borrowers with an increase of 0.25 [percentage point] adding $100 to the monthly repayment on a $600,000 loan over 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cEven without a rate increase, a three-month extension before a rate cut adds $288 in extra repayments to the same loan.\u201d David Bassanese, chief economist with Betashares, said the monthly CPI was a \u201cshocker\u201d that placed \u201chuge pressure on the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates in August\u201d. \u201cFor the RBA, the concern remains that the longer inflation stays high, the greater the risk of it becoming embedded into inflation expectations and ongoing wage and price setting behaviour \u2013 particularly given the economy, despite weak growth, is still operating at a high level of capacity,\u201d Bassanese said. Prior to today\u2019s figures all of the big four commercial banks \u2013 save ANZ \u2013 were forecasting the RBA would cut its cash rate in November. ANZ earlier this month broke ranks to predict the first rate cut wouldn\u2019t happen until February 2025."

Now we wait to see if unemployment also starts to falter and tips us over that edge. No, we are not in a recession, but cripes, the March quarter national accounts show an economy performing as badly as it can without actually being in recession. The 0.1% growth in the March quarter is essentially a rounding error away from going backwards. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup And things are no better if we look at annual growth. If we take out the pandemic period \u2013 when economic data really made no sense \u2013 the 1.1% annual growth of GDP is the slowest we have seen in Australia since March 1992. Take out population growth and we have now had five consecutive quarters of the economy going backwards. It\u2019s the first time that has happened since we started recording per capita growth back in 1973. That is not a record you want to be setting. In the past year the economy shrank 1.3% when you exclude population growth. The pandemic years aside, that is the worst growth since December 1991, when we were in the deepest of deep recessions: If the graph does not display click here So no, not good. Why are things so slow? Well, just take a peek at how much average interest repayments have gone up in the past two years: If the graph does not display click here The RBA has essentially done in two years what it took five years to do during the mining boom, when household incomes and wages were rising strongly. It has done this because the RBA believes that there is \u201cexcess demand\u201d in the economy. Clearly they have a different view of excess than the rest of us. The only reason really to even care about GDP as a measure is that there is a generally solid link between it and unemployment. As a rule we need the economy to grow about 2.75% a year to keep unemployment stable. If GDP grows by less than that, unemployment usually starts rising: If the graph does not display click here If there was no link between GDP growth and unemployment, then to be honest it would be a meaningless number we might as well ignore. The other important thing about GDP is that households make up a bit over half of it, so if GDP is struggling there\u2019s a good chance that people are, too \u2013 and right now the level of living standards of Australian households is back where it was a decade ago: If the graph does not display click here That is not a sign of health. And what has been the big driver of weak living standards? Well, did you remember my mentioning interest rate rises? If the graph does not display click here The increased cost of paying off home loans has had a major impact on people\u2019s living standards, but so too has weak wages growth. In the March quarter the average compensation for each employee rose 0.6% while the average cost of things we spend our money on (including bills) rose 1%. Not surprisingly what we\u2019re seeing is households spending very frugally. We never quite got back to spending as much as we likely would have were it not for the pandemic \u2013 but now the amount we\u2019re spending is increasing by less than it was before 2020: If the graph does not display click here In the year to March, household spending rose 1.3% \u2013 around half the pre-pandemic rate. And any growth was mostly on essential items. Spending on essentials rose 2.1% over the past year, while spending on discretionary items \u2013 those things you buy when you are feeling good \u2013 rose just 0.1%. That does not sound like excess demand to me, but apparently the RBA thinks it does. We aren\u2019t spending more because we have so much more income, rather that we are saving less. The household saving rate was as low as it has been since 2008: If the graph does not display click here It means overall households did not contribute much to the growth of the economy, but to be honest, no one was really contributing to the growth of the economy because there was hardly any! If the graph does not display click here If you squint you could say the buildup of inventories is a sign that businesses hope to be able to sell stock later, but more likely it is just replenishing the stocks they have run down over the past few months rather than a sign of hope and optimism. The cost of labour in real terms fell 0.7% in the March quarter to reinforce again that wages are not fueling inflation. The real cost of profits remains higher than it was before the pandemic, unlike labour costs: If the graph does not display click here The GDP figures show an economy that has been smashed by interest rate rises. The RBA believes we are too rich, too many of us are employed and we are spending too much money. The GDP figures, however, show our living standards are as bad as they have been for a decade, our wages are not keeping up with our costs, and we are barely increasing our spending on anything other than essential goods and services. The economy has been going backwards for more than a year, except for population growth. Take that away and it looks like a recession. The only reason we are not in one is because \u2013 thankfully \u2013 unemployment has not risen sharply yet. And let us hope that is not the next chapter of the RBA\u2019s sorry tale of how the economy should be managed. Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

Stock markets have hit new highs, with the Dow Jones industrial average passing 40,000 points for the first time ever. The International Monetary Fund predicted last month that the US economy was on track to grow at double the rate of any other G7 nation this year. But so far, many Americans are not buying what Biden is selling. According to a Harris poll conducted for the Guardian last month, 56% of Americans wrongly believe that the US economy is in a recession, even though the country\u2019s GDP has grown in recent months. Republicans were more likely to hold that belief, with 67% of them saying the economy is in a recession compared with 49% of Democrats and 53% of independents. The survey continued a trend of Republicans reporting higher levels of pessimism about the nation\u2019s finances since Biden took office. But the relationship between political identity and consumer sentiment has actually been documented for decades, intensifying alongside partisanship in recent years. This political bias offers a partial \u2013 although far from complete \u2013 explanation for Americans\u2019 persistently dour opinions of the nation\u2019s finances. In recent weeks, the Guardian has dispatched reporters to key swing counties in battleground states, and voters representing a wide array of political views expressed disappointment with the higher cost of living. As LeMario Brown, a former city council member in Fort Valley, Georgia, and local pecan farmer, said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re Republican or Democrat, we all got to eat.\u201d With less than five months left before election day, Biden must find a way to break through the gloom and sell his vision of economic success. A partisan split The partisan skew in perceptions of the economy dates back at least to the Reagan administration, as the University of Michigan\u2019s national consumer confidence data shows. With a Republican in the White House, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say the economy is strong, and the same principle applies when a Democrat takes office. Though the correlation between political identity and consumer sentiment has long been recognized by economists, it appears to have grown stronger in recent years. One study from the University of Florida, based on decades of data from the Florida Consumer Attitude survey, found that state residents reported notably higher levels of consumer confidence after their preferred party regained control of the White House. In the fall of 2016, after Trump won the presidential race, Republicans started expressing much more optimism about their personal finances. \u201cOver time, [these shifts] have gotten bigger and bigger* \u2026 It\u2019s true that, somehow, this kind of partisanship has been increasing,\u201d said Hector Sandoval, director of the economic analysis program at the University of Florida\u2019s Bureau of Economic and Business Research. Sandoval noted that, in 2016, the shift in sentiment can be observed in the immediate month after Trump won the election in November, even though he did not take office until January. \u201cThat\u2019s even kind of striking because nothing has really happened [by this time],\u201d Sandoval said. \u201cThe change in power isn\u2019t until the next year, in January. But already by then you see how the consumer sentiment is changing a lot.\u201d Although Democrats\u2019 consumer attitudes have also been found to vary depending on the national political environment, Sandoval\u2019s research found this shift to be particularly pronounced among Republicans, a finding that has been corroborated by other studies. Ryan Cummings, who previously worked for Biden\u2019s council of economic advisers, and Neale Mahoney, who served as an adviser to the Biden administration\u2019s national economic council, refer to this pattern as \u201casymmetric amplification\u201d. According to an analysis by Cummings and Mahoney, the magnitude of the partisan bias on consumer sentiment is roughly two and a half times larger for Republicans compared with Democrats. In a phone call, Mahoney, now an economics professor at Stanford University, summarized the finding by saying that Republicans \u201ccheer louder and boo harder\u201d when their party controls the White House. Cummings and Mahoney found that this asymmetric amplification accounts for roughly a third of the gap between predicted consumer sentiment, based on current economic conditions, and observed consumer sentiment. In the Harris poll, Republicans were indeed more likely to incorrectly say that the economy is in a recession, but notably, nearly half of Democrats believed the same. So even when accounting for partisan bias, about two-thirds of the consumer sentiment gap remains. That has left economists \u2013 and many frustrated members of Biden\u2019s team \u2013 searching for answers. Beyond the politics Potential explanations for consumers\u2019 lingering pessimism have abounded as election day nears. Greg Ip, a Wall Street Journal columnist, has attributed the pessimism to what he calls \u201creferred pain\u201d, meaning Americans are casting their broader doubts and fears about the state of the world on to the economy. \u201cJust as one part of your body can hurt because of injury to another, pessimism about the economy may reflect dissatisfaction with the country as a whole,\u201d Ip wrote in November. \u201cLately, there has been a lot to be dissatisfied about: intensifying political and cultural conflict and intolerance, the pandemic, the border, mass shootings, crime, war in Ukraine and now the war in the Middle East.\u201d Another explanation touches on the role of the media, with some experts arguing that coverage of the economy has become skewed toward bad news. One recent study from Ben Harris and Aaron Sojourner of the Brookings Institution concluded that \u201ceconomic news has become systemically more negative beginning in 2018, with the negative bias growing over the past three years\u201d. A third school of thought addresses the long-term pain and general psychology around inflation. Although the most recent CPI data found that prices rose by 3.4% over the past 12 months, prices have increased by roughly 20% since 2019. So even as the rate of inflation has fallen, Americans are still adjusting to the overall rise in the cost of living over the past few years. Prices also show no sign of significantly decreasing, a phenomenon known as deflation that is generally associated with times of severe economic distress. A separate analysis from Cummings and Mahoney found that \u201cthe impact of inflation on consumer sentiment fades out with a decay rate of about 50 percent per year,\u201d meaning it takes a few years for the sting of a high inflationary period to substantially dissipate. \u201cThe impact of inflation this year is half as big as the impact last year, which is half as big as the impact in the year beforehand, so it has a half-life of basically one year,\u201d Mahoney said. \u201cBut it takes two to three years for most of the impact of inflation to no longer show up in an analysis which connects inflation to consumer sentiment.\u201d That lingering effect can dramatically alter views on the economy because, to put it bluntly, consumers really hate high inflation. Research by Stefanie Stantcheva, an economics professor at Harvard University, found that high inflation triggered feelings of anger, fear and injustice. Respondents expressed a widespread belief that their wages were not keeping pace with inflation, resulting in decreased buying power for their households. Respondents do report receiving wage increases as the inflation rate rose, but people tend to associate those raises with their own job performance or career progression, rather than the higher cost of living, so they often feel like inflation is robbing them of their hard-won earnings. Interestingly, people also tend to believe that the salaries of higher-income individuals are better able to keep up with inflation, amplifying feelings of unfairness. \u201cAs a result, when you ask people about the emotions that are triggered when they see prices rise, it\u2019s a lot of stress, fear, anger,\u201d Stantcheva said. \u201c[That anger] tends to be directed at businesses [and] quite a lot at the government.\u201d The way forward? Behind Americans\u2019 doubts about the health of the economy are statistics that go beyond jobs and inflation rates. Understanding those metrics could be key to moving beyond some of the partisan perspectives. Despite the overall economic improvement, persistently high interest rates have increased the cost of carrying debt, adding to the burden of credit card bills and auto loans. Credit card debt hit a record high of $1.1tn in the final quarter of 2023, although that figure slightly declined in the first quarter of this year. Mortgage rates have come down marginally since last fall, when they reached a 23-year high, but their elevation has added to Americans\u2019 existing concerns that the goal of homeownership has moved permanently out of reach. Underlying these statistics is the grim reality of how they disproportionately affect lower-income families. Stantcheva\u2019s study found that lower-income Americans report being most adversely affected by high inflation, with some saying they have even delayed buying essentials to cope with rising prices. Her work builds on existing research suggesting that, though high inflation is loathed by all, the burden of the rising cost of living is not equally shared. Stantcheva\u2019s research also offers some insight into Americans\u2019 thoughts on building a fairer economic system. Like other recent surveys, respondents displayed broad support for a number of policy proposals that might address some of those concerns, including raising taxes on corporations and the wealthiest households. Biden has called for such changes to the tax code, although he has struggled to get them approved by Congress, and he has incorporated his support for tax reform into his campaign messaging. The messaging could help Biden bridge the divide between his story of economic success and the reality that many Americans are not yet feeling the benefit of the recovery. \u201cWe don\u2019t know each person\u2019s situation, and the statistics just don\u2019t capture this very well,\u201d Stantcheva said. \u201cSo I think these feelings should not be dismissed at all. They should be taken quite seriously.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-19T15:00:16Z",
            "content": "The Reserve Bank\u2019s decision to keep rates steady reinforced that the economy at this moment remains one with both good and bad signs, and the RBA governor, Michele Bullock, is refreshingly upfront about the difficulties. Unsurprisingly, the RBA\u2019s call to keep rates unchanged was met by some in the media and conservative commentariat as a failure to be tough. Some would prefer the RBA to be less concerned about the risk of a recession or rising unemployment than getting inflation from 3.6% to below 3%. Such views are much easier to make when your own job is safe and your income is very comfortable. It is worth remembering that in the past two years the share of household income spent on mortgage repayments has risen by the amount it did in five years during the mining boom, and by more than occurred in the run-up to the 1990s recession: If the graph does not display click here And while we\u2019re not quite spending as great of a share of our income on repayments as we were in 2008, the cost of an average dwelling is now equivalent to 16.6 years\u2019 worth of the average household disposable income, compared to 12.3 years then and 9.5 years in 1989 when the cost of servicing a loan peaked before the recession: If the graph does not display click here So those wanting more pain are really talking about a historical level of hurt, even though inflation has come down at the same pace it has in other nations with higher rates such as the US and Canada. Fortunately, Bullock is rather more careful than are those blithely dismissing concerns of a recession. In her press conference, and the RBA\u2019s policy statement, Bullock noted that the \u201coutlook remains highly uncertain\u201d. One of the biggest reasons for this uncertainty is something that happened in the latest GDP figures. The RBA has been trying to work out why household spending was so bad. After all, unemployment was still around 4.0%, wage growth was at 4.1%, and finally real wages were rising. And yet household spending was utterly stuffed \u2013 growing a mere 0.1% over the year in 2023. Then, in the March GDP data, the Australia Bureau of Statistics revised the figures, in an attempt to get \u201cseasonally adjusted\u201d back to some sort of sense after the years of Covid insanity. And it now estimates that we spent more in 2023 than previously thought. Rather than just 0.1% annual growth last year, the ABS now estimates our spending increased by 1.0%. If the graph does not display click here Now that is still pathetic. As I noted earlier this month, most of the growth was on essential items. The figures in March were just bad rather than terrible. But the ABS also revised down how much we saved: If the graph does not display click here The household savings ratio in December was revised down from 3.2% to 1.6%. In dollar terms the changes look like this: If the graph does not display click here Household income was not revised by much, so all the changes were about what we were doing with our money \u2013 spending more and saving less, or in effect, saving less to spend more. The question is: what does this mean for inflation and interest rates? Bullock doesn\u2019t seem to be sure. And she was upfront about this. She told the media gathering on Tuesday that you can think about these changes \u201cin a couple of ways\u201d. The first way is the glass half-full view. People, she suggested, are \u201csaving less to support their consumption because they\u2019re very confident about the future\u201d. That is, we feel confident that our jobs are secure and that our wages will rise above inflation and so why save for a rainy day? Let\u2019s go spend! The other way is more of a glass half-empty view. In this view she suggested the figures show that \u201cpeople are really hurting and they\u2019re not saving as much, and they\u2019re really struggling to make ends meet, in which case that doesn\u2019t bode so well for consumption\u201d. If the glass half-full view is correct, then the coming stage-three tax cuts might add to the amount of spending in a manner that may cause inflation to rise. If the glass half-empty view is correct, then the stage-three tax cuts will lessen the struggle and have a negligible impact on inflation. For now, the market continues to believe that the next move is for a rate cut: If the graph does not display click here But the future here is uncertain and, while the media does like to suggest that uncertainty means a rate rise is more likely, the uncertainty also relates to the possible need for a rate cut. Bullock noted that the RBA is also focused on unemployment because \u201cpeople having jobs is critical to them being able to meet the challenges of the higher cost of living\u201d. She also said the bank still believes it is \u201con the narrow path\u201d to getting inflation down while keeping unemployment low and Australia out of a recession. But crucially she added that the path \u201cdoes appear to be getting a bit narrower\u201d. This certainly is worrying, but it is good to know that the RBA is much more concerned about the great cost of people losing their jobs than are those who blithely suggest rates need to be raised with little to no regard for the risks of a recession or the loss of jobs that would bring. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

            "date": "2024-06-12T08:18:09Z",
            "content": "The UK economy flatlined in April, held back by wet weather, as the signs of a recovery from last year\u2019s recession began to fade. In a blow to Rishi Sunak\u2019s hopes of signalling a strong bounceback before the general election on 4 July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said monthly growth stalled after a 0.4% increase in March. The economy was unable to maintain its momentum after being weighed down by the struggling retail sector, a downturn in manufacturing and a drop in construction output. The 0.0% growth figure matched the forecast by City economists, who blamed the month\u2019s heavy rains for difficulties faced by workers on building sites and the lack of shoppers on the high street. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the underlying weakness of the economy was revealed by figures that showed growth so far in 2024 had only recovered lost ground from the recession last year. \u201cRishi Sunak claims we have turned a corner, but the economy has stalled and there is no growth,\u201d she said. Sunak said in March that the economy was \u201cbouncing back\u201d from a downturn in 2023. Responding to Wednesday\u2019s figures, a spokesperson for the Conservative party said: \u201cThere is more to do, but the economy is turning a corner and inflation is back down to normal.\u201d Manufacturing output fell by 1.4% month on month in April, while construction activity was 1.4% lower and retailers lost 2% of their trade. These declines were balanced out by a 2% rise across the whole services sector, boosted by rises in IT and communication services, professional businesses (1.2%), and arts and entertainment (2.6%). The general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, said the economy\u2019s stagnation was causing long-term harm to households\u2019 incomes. \u201cOur economy is slowing yet again,\u201d the TUC leader said. \u201cThis has been the worst government for growth in modern times \u2013 and working people have paid the price.\u201d He said analysis of official figures showed that annual growth had averaged 1.5% since 2010, the worst performance for a government since the great depression. Wages, after taking inflation into account, were worth less than 2008, Nowak added, and unemployment had risen at the fastest rate in the G7 this year. \u201cThe Conservatives can spin all they like. But the last 14 years have been dismal for growth and living standards.\u201d Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the economy could begin to grow again during the summer. \u201cDespite the stalling of the recovery in April, the dual drags on economic growth from higher interest rates and higher inflation will continue to fade throughout the year. That will generate a bit of an economic tailwind for the next government,\u201d he said. Separate surveys of private sector businesses show most areas of the economy have expanded month on month since the beginning of the year. Figures released last month showed the economy grew by 0.6% in the three months to the end of March \u2013 the strongest rate of quarterly growth since the end of 2021 \u2013 confirming the UK had officially exited recession after the economy contracted in the second half of last year. In the three months to the end of April growth was 0.7%, the same level forecast for the whole year by the International Monetary Fund in its biannual outlook in spring. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently downgraded its prediction for UK growth this year from 0.7% to 0.4%. The Paris-based organisation said longer-term issues faced by the UK, including a major skills shortage, high prices in the shops and elevated interest rates, accounted for the gloomy outlook. Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said April\u2019s zero growth rate in national income, or gross domestic product (GDP), was unlikely to encourage the Bank of England to cut interest rates at its meeting later this month. \u201cDespite these disappointing GDP figures, a June interest rate cut looks improbable, with the Bank of England likely to be a little wary of shifting policy in the middle of a general election campaign,\u201d he said."

Now, our economy is literally the envy of the world,\u201d the US president said. \u201cAnd it takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it.\u201d As Biden frequently boasts, 15m jobs have been created since he took office, and the unemployment rate now stands at 4% after 41 consecutive months of job gains, following the longest stretch of sub-4% unemployment since the 1960s. Inflation has also cooled, after the annual consumer price index hit a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. Stock markets have hit new highs, with the Dow Jones industrial average passing 40,000 points for the first time ever. The International Monetary Fund predicted last month that the US economy was on track to grow at double the rate of any other G7 nation this year. But so far, many Americans are not buying what Biden is selling. According to a Harris poll conducted for the Guardian last month, 56% of Americans wrongly believe that the US economy is in a recession, even though the country\u2019s GDP has grown in recent months. Republicans were more likely to hold that belief, with 67% of them saying the economy is in a recession compared with 49% of Democrats and 53% of independents. The survey continued a trend of Republicans reporting higher levels of pessimism about the nation\u2019s finances since Biden took office. But the relationship between political identity and consumer sentiment has actually been documented for decades, intensifying alongside partisanship in recent years. This political bias offers a partial \u2013 although far from complete \u2013 explanation for Americans\u2019 persistently dour opinions of the nation\u2019s finances. In recent weeks, the Guardian has dispatched reporters to key swing counties in battleground states, and voters representing a wide array of political views expressed disappointment with the higher cost of living. As LeMario Brown, a former city council member in Fort Valley, Georgia, and local pecan farmer, said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re Republican or Democrat, we all got to eat.\u201d With less than five months left before election day, Biden must find a way to break through the gloom and sell his vision of economic success. A partisan split The partisan skew in perceptions of the economy dates back at least to the Reagan administration, as the University of Michigan\u2019s national consumer confidence data shows. With a Republican in the White House, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say the economy is strong, and the same principle applies when a Democrat takes office. Though the correlation between political identity and consumer sentiment has long been recognized by economists, it appears to have grown stronger in recent years. One study from the University of Florida, based on decades of data from the Florida Consumer Attitude survey, found that state residents reported notably higher levels of consumer confidence after their preferred party regained control of the White House. In the fall of 2016, after Trump won the presidential race, Republicans started expressing much more optimism about their personal finances. \u201cOver time, [these shifts] have gotten bigger and bigger* \u2026 It\u2019s true that, somehow, this kind of partisanship has been increasing,\u201d said Hector Sandoval, director of the economic analysis program at the University of Florida\u2019s Bureau of Economic and Business Research. Sandoval noted that, in 2016, the shift in sentiment can be observed in the immediate month after Trump won the election in November, even though he did not take office until January. \u201cThat\u2019s even kind of striking because nothing has really happened [by this time],\u201d Sandoval said. \u201cThe change in power isn\u2019t until the next year, in January. But already by then you see how the consumer sentiment is changing a lot.\u201d Although Democrats\u2019 consumer attitudes have also been found to vary depending on the national political environment, Sandoval\u2019s research found this shift to be particularly pronounced among Republicans, a finding that has been corroborated by other studies. Ryan Cummings, who previously worked for Biden\u2019s council of economic advisers, and Neale Mahoney, who served as an adviser to the Biden administration\u2019s national economic council, refer to this pattern as \u201casymmetric amplification\u201d. According to an analysis by Cummings and Mahoney, the magnitude of the partisan bias on consumer sentiment is roughly two and a half times larger for Republicans compared with Democrats. In a phone call, Mahoney, now an economics professor at Stanford University, summarized the finding by saying that Republicans \u201ccheer louder and boo harder\u201d when their party controls the White House. Cummings and Mahoney found that this asymmetric amplification accounts for roughly a third of the gap between predicted consumer sentiment, based on current economic conditions, and observed consumer sentiment. In the Harris poll, Republicans were indeed more likely to incorrectly say that the economy is in a recession, but notably, nearly half of Democrats believed the same. So even when accounting for partisan bias, about two-thirds of the consumer sentiment gap remains. That has left economists \u2013 and many frustrated members of Biden\u2019s team \u2013 searching for answers. Beyond the politics Potential explanations for consumers\u2019 lingering pessimism have abounded as election day nears. Greg Ip, a Wall Street Journal columnist, has attributed the pessimism to what he calls \u201creferred pain\u201d, meaning Americans are casting their broader doubts and fears about the state of the world on to the economy. \u201cJust as one part of your body can hurt because of injury to another, pessimism about the economy may reflect dissatisfaction with the country as a whole,\u201d Ip wrote in November. \u201cLately, there has been a lot to be dissatisfied about: intensifying political and cultural conflict and intolerance, the pandemic, the border, mass shootings, crime, war in Ukraine and now the war in the Middle East.\u201d Another explanation touches on the role of the media, with some experts arguing that coverage of the economy has become skewed toward bad news. One recent study from Ben Harris and Aaron Sojourner of the Brookings Institution concluded that \u201ceconomic news has become systemically more negative beginning in 2018, with the negative bias growing over the past three years\u201d. A third school of thought addresses the long-term pain and general psychology around inflation. Although the most recent CPI data found that prices rose by 3.4% over the past 12 months, prices have increased by roughly 20% since 2019. So even as the rate of inflation has fallen, Americans are still adjusting to the overall rise in the cost of living over the past few years. Prices also show no sign of significantly decreasing, a phenomenon known as deflation that is generally associated with times of severe economic distress. A separate analysis from Cummings and Mahoney found that \u201cthe impact of inflation on consumer sentiment fades out with a decay rate of about 50 percent per year,\u201d meaning it takes a few years for the sting of a high inflationary period to substantially dissipate. \u201cThe impact of inflation this year is half as big as the impact last year, which is half as big as the impact in the year beforehand, so it has a half-life of basically one year,\u201d Mahoney said. \u201cBut it takes two to three years for most of the impact of inflation to no longer show up in an analysis which connects inflation to consumer sentiment.\u201d That lingering effect can dramatically alter views on the economy because, to put it bluntly, consumers really hate high inflation. Research by Stefanie Stantcheva, an economics professor at Harvard University, found that high inflation triggered feelings of anger, fear and injustice. Respondents expressed a widespread belief that their wages were not keeping pace with inflation, resulting in decreased buying power for their households. Respondents do report receiving wage increases as the inflation rate rose, but people tend to associate those raises with their own job performance or career progression, rather than the higher cost of living, so they often feel like inflation is robbing them of their hard-won earnings. Interestingly, people also tend to believe that the salaries of higher-income individuals are better able to keep up with inflation, amplifying feelings of unfairness. \u201cAs a result, when you ask people about the emotions that are triggered when they see prices rise, it\u2019s a lot of stress, fear, anger,\u201d Stantcheva said. \u201c[That anger] tends to be directed at businesses [and] quite a lot at the government.\u201d The way forward? Behind Americans\u2019 doubts about the health of the economy are statistics that go beyond jobs and inflation rates. Understanding those metrics could be key to moving beyond some of the partisan perspectives. Despite the overall economic improvement, persistently high interest rates have increased the cost of carrying debt, adding to the burden of credit card bills and auto loans. Credit card debt hit a record high of $1.1tn in the final quarter of 2023, although that figure slightly declined in the first quarter of this year. Mortgage rates have come down marginally since last fall, when they reached a 23-year high, but their elevation has added to Americans\u2019 existing concerns that the goal of homeownership has moved permanently out of reach. Underlying these statistics is the grim reality of how they disproportionately affect lower-income families. Stantcheva\u2019s study found that lower-income Americans report being most adversely affected by high inflation, with some saying they have even delayed buying essentials to cope with rising prices. Her work builds on existing research suggesting that, though high inflation is loathed by all, the burden of the rising cost of living is not equally shared. Stantcheva\u2019s research also offers some insight into Americans\u2019 thoughts on building a fairer economic system. Like other recent surveys, respondents displayed broad support for a number of policy proposals that might address some of those concerns, including raising taxes on corporations and the wealthiest households. Biden has called for such changes to the tax code, although he has struggled to get them approved by Congress, and he has incorporated his support for tax reform into his campaign messaging. The messaging could help Biden bridge the divide between his story of economic success and the reality that many Americans are not yet feeling the benefit of the recovery. \u201cWe don\u2019t know each person\u2019s situation, and the statistics just don\u2019t capture this very well,\u201d Stantcheva said. \u201cSo I think these feelings should not be dismissed at all. They should be taken quite seriously.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-14T14:38:50Z",
            "content": "The \u201cBridgerton effect\u201d has been hard to ignore since the drama first appeared on our screens, inspiring clothing and interiors trends with a period twist and helped make afternoon tea and visiting stately homes sexy. Now Netflix has put a big number on the worth of what it calls the \u201cBridgerton universe\u201d, suggesting the period romp produced by the company Shondaland has given a \u00a3275m shot in the arm to the UK\u2019s ailing economy over the past five years. Indeed, in a move that served to underscore the franchise\u2019s bankability, Shonda Rhimes \u2013 the chief executive of Shondaland and the veteran producer behind hits such as Grey\u2019s Anatomy \u2013 made a cameo in London\u2019s financial centre on Friday, opening trading at the London Stock Exchange. While the TV show, now into its third series, may offer escapism, Rhimes suggested its cultural impact was not to be underestimated. \u201cThe Bridgerton universe occupies a special space in culture, resonating with young and old alike, creating conversation, starting trends and influencing everything from baby names to weddings,\u201d she said. \u201cThe shows have had a seismic impact on the UK economy, boosting it by a quarter of a billion pounds over the last five years and supporting thousands of jobs and businesses.\u201d Netflix claimed the production had supported almost 5,000 local businesses over the past five years, with Rhimes stating that it was clear that the \u201cbusiness of art and culture can make a huge economic contribution to local communities\u201d. Anna Mallett, the vice-president of Europe, the Middle East and Africa production at Netflix, seconded Rhimes. \u201cAs well as an economic boost, the shows have had a huge cultural impact,\u201d she said. \u201cThe UK is our home and this is one part of our huge investment in creating stories our members will love.\u201d The \u00a3275m figure was calculated in-house by Netflix and includes direct and indirect spending, through money spent with other companies, getting it on to the screen. The upbeat message comes at a difficult time for UK film and TV studios, where jobs are going as the pandemic streaming boom unwinds. While it is not clear if Julia Hoggett is a Bridgerton fan, the London Stock Exchange chief executive said she was \u201cthrilled to celebrate the significant economic and cultural impact\u201d of the film and creative industries in the UK. The headline figure does not include other money-spinning activities piggybacking on the show, such as themed events and product ranges sold by retailers, or the likely tourism fillip as fans make pilgrimages to grand locations such as Castle Howard in Yorkshire and Ranger\u2019s House in Greenwich, London. This points to the \u00a3275m being a conservative estimate, as with its young glamorous cast the glossy drama is credited with spawning trend after \u201cRegencycore\u201d trend, with no sign of it running out of steam. Indeed a \u201cBridgerton tea party\u201d ranked highly in a recent Pinterest report looking at this summer\u2019s \u201chottest trends\u201d, with searches up 430% in April compared with a year earlier. Creative tea recipes were trending, it said, as people sought inspiration for what to serve and floral decor ideas. \u201cRegencycore\u201d is also still going strong on the high street with the upmarket London department store Liberty currently hosting an immersive Bridgerton pop-up and selling a dedicated fabric collection. The sumptuous interiors in the show are also said to be prompting the current craze for DIY panelling. While the series has given sales of, perhaps neglected, corsets, empire-waist and baby-doll dresses some oomph, the show\u2019s influence has now moved beyond fashion into beauty, with the online retailer Cult Beauty pointing to this summer\u2019s \u201cdefiant romance\u201d trend of blush cheeks and faux freckles. It is also behind new period-inspired looks for interiors and gardens. Beth Boulton, the marketing director at the home improvement specialist Eurocell, said that since the new series began airing, shoppers were searching online for wisteria plants, pergolas, water fountains and outdoor candles. \u201cThe show is synonymous with pots spilling with plants, and bright climbing flowers such as ivy and wisteria, that all add a sense of wonder to your garden,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2024-06-06T18:05:56Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s statistics watchdog has closed an investigation into remarks made by an official about the economy \u201cgoing gangbusters\u201d that were cited by Rishi Sunak. It was looking into the comments made by chief economist of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) last month amid concerns that politicians could misuse economic data in the run-up to the election. Grant Fitzner used the phrase in a briefing with journalists on 10 May after figures showed the UK was officially out of recession and that the economy grew by 0.6% in the first three months of the year and became the basis of a Daily Mail front page story the following day. A week later Sunak, in an interview on the Radio 4 Today programme, repeated the words, telling listeners: \u201cThe facts are the facts. You had, I think, the person from the Office for National Statistics talking about the economic growth that the country produced in the first quarter of the year. He said what he said about that and I think he used the term \u2018gangbusters\u2019, so I will leave it at that.\u201d The UK Statistics Authority, chaired by Sir Robert Chote, said on Tuesday that it was investigating the remarks. However, the case was examined by a different watchdog, the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR), which looked only at the ONS use of the term and not Sunak\u2019s. The OSR reported on Thursday that it had closed the case, but did not provide any further information on its findings, beyond referring the Guardian to a statement from the ONS, which said: \u201cThe use of the word \u2018gangbusters\u2019 was a passing reference used when our chief economist was discussing the first quarter\u2019s economic growth with journalists at our press briefing on release day. \u201cThe reference was made \u2013 paraphrasing a remark by a former Australian prime minister \u2013 as [first quarter] growth had come in stronger than commentators expected, with broad-based growth across services and manufacturing industries, and with quarterly growth at its strongest pace since the pandemic. \u201cIt was certainly not intended as a comment about the overall state of the economy and when the comment was made it was immediately clarified to those present that this was not a word that the ONS would use to describe the first quarter\u2019s growth. We also put the comment in context for journalists who followed up afterwards.\u201d Dario Perkins, a senior economist at the consultancy TS Lombard and former Treasury official, said it was unwise for the ONS to say the economy was growing quickly and wrong for the prime minister to use one quarter of GDP growth to argue that economic health had been restored. \u201cThe ONS is not supposed to use these kinds of descriptive words to tell a story about the economy. And it is also wrong to say the economy is booming in the first three months of the year when we have only just recovered lost growth from last year\u2019s recession and suffered the worst incomes squeeze in a generation.\u201d The OSR intervention came hours after Chote began a review of Sunak\u2019s claim in Tuesday night\u2019s leaders debate that independent civil servants calculated that Labour would raise taxes by \u00a32,000 for everyone should it win the election on 4 July. Labour has complained that the figure was wrong and was erroneously described as independently verified by Treasury civil servants. On Tuesday, hours before the TV debate between Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer, Chote wrote to the main political parties and top civil servants to warn them about \u201censuring the appropriate and transparent use of statistics\u201d. Chote previously ran the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, and was the head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, a leading arbiter of government tax and spending policies. On Thursday, the UK Statistics Authority said the \u00a32,000 claim failed an \u201cintelligent transparency\u201d test and was misleading. It warned all parties to refrain from making exaggerated or misleading claims about tax and spending policies. \u2022 This article was updated on 6 June 2024 to replace an earlier version that carried the headline: \u201cUK statistics watchdog to investigate Sunak\u2019s use of term \u2018economy going gangbusters\u2019\u201d. The investigation by the UK Statistics Authority concerned remarks made by an ONS official during a briefing with journalists, not the repetition of those remarks by Rishi Sunak, as the previous version stated. This investigation was not personally carried out by Sir Robert Chote but, as the updated version makes clear, by the Office for Statistics Regulation."

            "date": "2024-06-03T05:06:36Z",
            "content": "Qantas is rolling out a new boarding regime that will see passengers split into six boarding groups as it seeks to fill its planes faster and to ensure they depart on time. The new boarding protocol will initially apply only to domestic flights on Airbus A330s and Boeing 737s \u2013 the workhorses of its domestic services between capital cities. The new system was put in place at Brisbane airport from Monday, and its introduction will be staggered throughout the month, coming into effect at Perth airport from 10 June, at Melbourne from 17 June and Sydney from 25 June. Qantas will now split passengers into six groups in an attempt to avoid the chaotic queues that form at gates when economy is called to board. Premium travellers and the most loyal customers will retain superior priority. Group one will include those in business class, frequent flyers with platinum or platinum one status, as well as travellers from the exclusive chairman\u2019s lounge. Gold frequent flyers will board as group two. However, instead of the traditional approach where the front and back half of the plane are called to board separately, the cabin will be split into quarters. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Group three will include everyone seated in the back quarter of the plane, progressing to group six, which consists of passengers in the front quarter of economy. Each passenger\u2019s group will be printed on their boarding pass, with scanners at the gate only permitting customers of a group already called to pass through. The new system is intended to speed up boarding and minimise congestion throughout the cabin as travellers in back rows are forced to wait while those in earlier rows stand to load luggage into overhead lockers or shuffle between seats. The Qantas domestic chief executive, Markus Svensson, said the change was the most significant change to boarding in a decade. \u201cGroup Boarding is designed to minimise the time our customers spend waiting to board and allows them to get settled more quickly,\u201d Svensson said. \u201cWe know how important on time departure is to our customers, so this process is also about doing everything possible to ensure we depart on time.\u201d Qantas noted similar boarding methods had already been implemented by rivals overseas. The airline\u2019s approach is in contrast to US carrier United Airlines, which last year announced it would board economy passengers by their seat, not just their row, as part of its multi group boarding stages. On United flights, window seat passengers board first, followed by those with middle seats, before aisle seat travellers board. The system is designed to minimise traffic in the cabin aisles by avoiding the need for already seated passengers to get up to allow a window seat passenger in. United believes its approach cuts its boarding times by two minutes a flight."

            "content": "You simply cannot move for high-profile elections lately. The UK\u2019s big decision day is less than three weeks away; France called one last week in the wake of the EU election; my home country of South Africa had a particularly momentous one last month; Mexico just elected its first female president; and the US presidential face-off looms ominously ahead in the autumn. This can be easier to appreciate when you\u2019re not emotionally invested in the outcome, but elections are irresistibly dramatic events, with all their inbuilt narratives of expectation and upset, triumph and downfall \u2013 so it\u2019s no surprise that film-makers frequently seize on them. Hollywood, in particular, is fixated on the vastly tiered labyrinth of American electoral systems, from the trivial to the most high ranking. Alexander Payne\u2019s gleefully acidic teen comedy Election may seem a modest portrayal of a student council vote in a suburban high school, but it deftly distils all the manners, mores and strategies of grownup US politics into its showdown between a chilly overachiever and a trumped-up doofus. (Another school-based electoral comedy, Napoleon Dynamite, is perhaps less perceptive, but no less entertaining.) Moving into scarcely more mature territory, the seven-minute 1932 short Betty Boop For President (Internet Archive) saw the famous cartoon bombshell running successfully for president on a rather simple centrist manifesto promising efficient street cleaning and mass rain cover, though there\u2019s a hint of anti-Prohibition spirit to her victory. Still, she stands for more than Charlize Theron\u2019s presidential candidate in Long Shot. A likable romantic comedy that claims some progressive cred by reversing traditional gender dynamics with its love story between Theron\u2019s alpha female and Seth Rogen\u2019s schlubby aide, it\u2019s also careful not to state which party she represents, or what exactly her politics are. That vagueness is common in Hollywood political films, loath as they are to repel half a polarised population \u2013 back in 1962, John Frankenheimer\u2019s brilliant The Manchurian Candidate was a notable exception, with its feverish pile-up of brainwashing and gaslighting in the campaign of a Republican vice-presidential candidate plainly modelled on Joseph McCarthy. (Jonathan Demme\u2019s 2004 remake was a little more circumspect on that front.) Jeremy Larner was a speechwriter for a different McCarthy, five-time presidential candidate Eugene; he won an Oscar for later writing the pointed 1972 satire The Candidate, starring Robert Redford as the no-hoper Democrat running in a seemingly unwinnable California senatorial race, slowly turning the tide as he modifies his idealistic leftwing message. It bristles with first-hand authority and anger. In the Clinton era, Barry Levinson and David Mamet\u2019s nimble satire Wag the Dog got a boost from the uncanny timing of its release one month before the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke \u2013 an ideal coincidence for a film about spin doctors fabricating an overseas war to distract from a presidential sex scandal weeks before the election. By the time the actually Clinton-inspired comedy Primary Colors (BBC iPlayer) came out the next year, lightly fictionalising his presidential campaign, it didn\u2019t seem quite as edgy \u2013 though Elaine May\u2019s screenplay still had plenty of wit. British elections, on the other hand, have rarely tempted film-makers \u2013 too dour and formal, perhaps. Back in 1959, Sidney Gilliat\u2019s featherweight romantic comedy Left, Right and Centre built a rare fiction around a Tory-Labour contest, though it can currently be found only on DVD. The 2021 horror film Election Night, set around a viewing party for an election pitched rather fancifully between radical-left and far-right parties, has novelty on its side, if not much else. As for British election biopics, it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone wanting to revisit the negotiations between David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Gordon Brown after the 2010 vote, but if you do, Coalition (Amazon) has your back. Chile gave us one of the great campaign dramas in No, Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s riveting, darkly funny and finally rousing portrayal of the political machinations behind the country\u2019s 1988 referendum that ended the rule of Augusto Pinochet. Staying in South America, Petra Costa\u2019s urgently impassioned documentary The Edge of Democracy (Netflix) leaves one\u2019s spirit rather less lifted with its account of the circumstances building to Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s 2018 presidential victory. The rough-and-tumble of African electoral politics, meanwhile, has been superbly covered in a pair of recent docs: Sam Soko\u2019s Softie, about an idealistic Kenyan journalist turned activist turned candidate, and last year\u2019s Oscar-nominated Bobi Wine: The People\u2019s President, in which a Ugandan pop star fights the power. Finally, the excellent, little-seen Indonesian film Autobiography (BFI Player) traces a relationship of toxic influence between a corrupt, military-minded mayoral candidate and his young assistant \u2013 an election film with all the atmospheric tension and unease that\u2019s harder to enjoy in a real-life context. Also new on streaming Ultraman: Rising (Netflix) You needn\u2019t be familiar with the extended history and lore of Japanese superhero Ultraman to enjoy this cheerful, family-friendly animation, which sees a baseball star reluctantly assuming the eponymous hero\u2019s mantle while also fostering an enormous but adorable baby kaiju monster. Thrills, spills and \u201cawwwwwws\u201d ensue in equal measure. Drive-Away Dolls (Universal) One hopes the Coen brothers\u2019 current period of working solo is temporary. Joel\u2019s Macbeth was a handsome enough experiment, but this frenetic road-movie farce from Ethan \u2013 written with his wife Tricia Cooke \u2013 is ungainly and unfunny, lifted only somewhat by Margaret Qualley and Geraldine Viswanathan\u2019s game performances as lesbian pals on the run from mobsters. Made in England: The Films of Powell and Pressburger (Altitude) Director David Hinton\u2019s straightforward documentary celebration of the oeuvre of Britain\u2019s great cinematic dreamers \u2013 the men behind The Red Shoes, A Matter of Life and Death and so on \u2013 is made special by Martin Scorsese\u2019s personal and palpably enthused narration throughout."

EU leaders are so concerned over foreign interference in the polls, due to take place from Thursday to Sunday, that they have put rapid alert teams on notice to swing into action in the event of a serious incident. Officials say the quantity of disinformation has reached \u201ctsunami levels\u201d \u2013 but political leaders have been the slowest to catch on. \u201cIt\u2019s as if we have been put to sleep by the peace dividend,\u201d said one senior EU official, referring to Europe after the second world war. \u201cIt is like we have been infected by this foreign interference. It is a silent killer.\u201d The threat is not expected to end when the polls for the European parliamentary elections across 27 nations close at 10pm on Sunday. A disinformation crisis unit, set up in April as campaigning began, has been asked to continue for weeks after the elections to deal with attacks on the legitimacy of the results. \u201cThe expectation is that it is around election day that we will see this interruption of narratives questioning the legitimacy of the European elections, and in the weeks around it,\u201d said one senior official with knowledge of the unit. \u201cTen years ago we talked about election interference, but [Donald] Trump has shown us it is a lot easier, a lot cheaper just to question things. You don\u2019t need to manipulate the vote.\u201d The unit allows member states to alert the rest of the bloc to threats they are seeing on their home turf. But it has also taken on a strategic role, with senior officials in the EU saying the aim is not to deal with each instance of fake news or race hate, but to go after \u201cthose who hold the trigger\u201d. This has allowed them to build a bigger picture to combat low-level foreign interference, particularly from Russia. \u201cWhat they are trying to do is destroy the west\u2019s way of life. Their aim is to undermine the trust in everything,\u201d one official said. \u201cIf you think about it, democracy is based on a free and fair vote and the assumption that citizens are informed. If you can no longer trust the information, you do not have a free vote.\u201d Senior EU experts who gathered to discuss the matter earlier this year heard estimates that Russia was spending \u20ac1bn on disinformation. A Nato assistant secretary general, Marie-Doha Besancenot, told the audience of ministers, commissioners and MEPs there was \u201cvery acute awareness\u201d that this was \u201ca major threat\u201d, so much so that allies agreed \u201chybrid operations could reach the level of an armed attack\u201d. The crisis unit, now running for five weeks, is the first attempt to respond in real time and take the fight to the online street. It allows each of the 27 member states to share the latest intelligence on foreign interference with fortnightly summaries listing hundreds of incidents in the bloc. They have their work cut out for them. Every day social media channels are awash with fake or mashed-up news, some explicitly aimed at undermining Ukraine, others negatively portraying western values. After more than two years studying disinformation, EU officials have concluded that it is not being used to help more Russia or China-friendly MEPs win seats in the upcoming elections, but to promote an anti-western narrative. Recent red-flag content raised by the European Digital Media Observatory (Edmo) in Brussels included social media posts claiming to show dead French soldiers being expatriated from Ukraine. The photo was in fact of soldiers killed in Mali in 2019. In Germany and Spain, there have been posts encouraging people to put marks such as percentage signs on their ballot papers as a supposedly valid way of \u201cdouble voting\u201d. In fact, such signs would invalidate a vote. The EU external services unit, EUvsdisinfo, says Russia-backed disinformation is used \u201cto smear leaders, foment distrust, flood social media with falsehoods, turn the public against Ukraine, and avoid comparisons uncomfortable to Putin\u2019s Russia\u201d. An anonymous account on X, Radio Genoa, which has more than 735,000 followers and spews a stream of provocative videos to an audience of millions suggesting people of colour and Muslims are a danger to society, is one example. An investigation by the Belgian TV channel VRT found that 84% of the account\u2019s videos were about migration, Muslims or people of colour. Its clips reached almost 3bn views in the year to April 2024, with one tweet questioning the rescue of people in the Mediterranean \u2013 shared by X\u2019s owner, Elon Musk \u2013 receiving over 70m page-views. The EU\u2019s diplomatic service is also on high alert, supporting a network of factchecking operations. Recent claims included a hoax report in Greece that Germany had decriminalised online child sexual abuse. In Slovakia, pro-Kremlin channels spread false claims that the wife of the man accused of shooting the prime minister, Robert Fico, was a refugee from Ukraine. Officials say they believe younger voters, who have grown up with social media, are instinctively alert to the new web of narratives, even those involving AI-generated content. The slowest out of the block, they say, are political leaders. One senior official said a recent scandal over the Voice of Europe website \u2013 hit with sanctions by Prague amid accusations it was spreading pro-Kremlin propaganda \u2013 was a wake-up call. \u201cWe realised that, yes, we have been blindsided,\u201d said one diplomat."

Now we do. It\u2019ll certainly influence our vote.\u201d A shop worker married to a plumber, with three children under nine, Montanari, 37, said she had recently gone back to full-time working from three days a week. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the politicians realise how much more expensive life is now for families since Covid,\u201d she said. \u201cAlmost everything \u2013 electricity, gas, basic foods like pasta. I\u2019m not decided yet. But I\u2019ll be looking carefully at what they plan to do about it.\u201d Emmanuel Macron, like Rishi Sunak, has called a snap election, which will be held over the two weekends that straddle polling day in the UK. Like the British prime minister, the French president is taking a gamble that at this stage does not appear to be going entirely to plan. Voters, unhappy about the state of the French economy, are abandoning the parties of the centre in favour of those of the right and the left. Anti-government sentiment is running high. Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, says: \u201cFrance has suffered from all the problems the rest of Europe and the developed world more generally has been suffering from: the pandemic, the energy shock, relatively weak productivity, an economy that is not growing very much, insecurity. \u201cThere are big economic problems that are contributing to people\u2019s discontent.\u201d Assib Hamadi, 45, a deputy hotel manager, is one of those who have lost patience with Macron. He says the cost of living is his \u201cnumber one priority\u201d and one of the main reasons why he does not plan to vote for President Macron\u2019s centrist party, as he had done in 2017 and 2022. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t done enough,\u201d says Hamadi. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to get worse this year \u2013 gas is going up in July, electricity later. They say inflation\u2019s down but I\u2019m certainly not feeling it. That\u2019s the first job of a government, isn\u2019t it? Make sure everyone can get by.\u201d Although France has recorded one of the lowest cumulative inflation rates in the EU since 2019, polls show the cost of living is voters\u2019 top concern. Politicians have taken the message on board, with all three main contenders in the snap elections \u2013 National Rally (RN), the left-green New Popular Front (NFP) alliance and Macron\u2019s Renaissance \u2013 promising relief. But the prospect of higher spending whatever the outcome of the election has spooked financial markets already concerned about the size of France\u2019s annual budget deficit and its rising national debt. Last week, the European Commission opened a disciplinary case over France\u2019s failure to stick by the EU\u2019s tough budget rules. These stipulate that member states run budget deficits of no more than 3% of annual income. Last year, France ran a 5.5% budget deficit and, despite some planned spending cuts by Macron\u2019s government, it will decline only modestly over the next few years. The International Monetary Fund estimates that by 2027 the deficit will still be 4.5% of GDP \u2013 far too high as far as Brussels is concerned. The Washington-based IMF says France needs a fresh dose of austerity to get Brussels off its back. That, though, was an assessment made before the elections to the European parliament, in which the RN topped the poll. That prompted a sharp sell-off in French bonds and shares, raising the prospect of a Liz Truss moment: a government that pursues economic policies that alarm the financial markets, and pays a heavy price for doing so. Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s economy minister, name-checked Britain\u2019s short-lived prime minister as he sought to warn voters of the risks of voting for RN. \u201cA Liz Truss-style scenario is possible,\u201d he says. Gabriel Attal, the prime minister, on Thursday described his rivals\u2019 plans as \u201ca leap into the unknown, from a great height, without a parachute\u201d. Kenningham says the state of the French public finances is the country\u2019s biggest headache. When monetary union was launched a quarter of a century ago, Germany and France had similar sized national debt at 60% of GDP. Since then, Kenningham says, Germany\u2019s debt to GDP ratio has remained virtually the same whereas France\u2019s has almost doubled, to 110% of GDP. \u201cAt a time when there is a need to make deficit cuts, electing a party whose main platform involves a very big increase in the deficit is asking for trouble. Investors are not going to want to lend a lot of money to the French government.\u201d Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank, says there are four possible election scenarios: a hung parliament in which no party has an overall majority; a government dominated by the RN that softens its policy stance; an RN government that sticks to its past agenda and picks fights with the EU; and a left government that pursues a radical agenda of price freezes on food and energy, reduces the pension age to 60 and introduces a wealth tax. \u201cUnder any of our scenarios, France will likely have to live with a higher yield spread over Germany, lower trend growth and some ratings downgrades in the future. Over time, all three factors would exacerbate France\u2019s fiscal challenges.\u201d Aware of the risk of a fresh fall in French bonds and shares should the markets take fright at some of their proposals, RN and NFP have sought to present themselves as responsible economic managers. NFP has said its budget deficit will not exceed that of the present government, with measures such as lowering the retirement age back to 60 funded by stronger economic growth and higher tax revenues from those better off. RN has said that if it wins it will be \u201creasonable, realistic and responsible\u201d, acknowledging that all of its economic plans, which also include returning the retirement age to 60, will not be achievable straight away, or even soon. Business leaders remain to be convinced. Medef, France\u2019s equivalent of the CBI, said last week that the proposals of \u201csome parties\u201d were likely to weaken France economically and lead to financial instability. \u201cThe result will be crucial to the creation of an economic future in which companies can prosper and create jobs.\u201d For some analysts the current state of French politics is reminiscent of the early 1980s, when the newly elected socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, who arrived in office on a platform that included nationalisation, wealth taxes and a higher minimum wage was forced \u2013 under intense pressure from the markets \u2013 into an austerity U-turn within two years. Philippe Ledent, senior economist at ING bank, says: \u201cToday, budgetary and debt problems are greater, growth potential is lower and the duties incumbent on each member state of the monetary union are even stricter.\u201d In Ledent\u2019s view, a leftwing or a rightwing government would have to choose between provoking an economic, financial and institutional crisis or heavily watering down its initial programme. \u201cThe examples of Greece in the early 2010s, and more recently of Italy, tend to show that the second option will eventually prevail,\u201d he says."

            "content": "Voting in the first round of parliamentary elections is under way in mainland France. The last polling stations close at 8pm local time on Sunday. Elections for the 577 seats in France\u2019s national assembly are a two-round process. The shape of the new parliament will become clear only after the second round on 7 July. Turnout The turnout at 5pm CET in mainland France was 59.39% according to the interior ministry \u2013 a significant increase on the 39.42% who had voted at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2022. Polling has suggested that this parliamentary election may have the highest turnout in almost 30 years. The polling firm Elabe estimated that the final turnout would reach 69.5%. National vote share Estimations at 8pm CET will project the national vote share of parties. But this figure must be taken with caution. It will show the broad dynamic of support for each party across France, but it does not indicate the shape of a future parliament because the 577 different constituency votes will be defined by local context and candidates. Polls have shown that, in terms of overall national vote share, the far-right National Rally could substantially increase its showing from the last parliament election, when it took just over 18%, to about 35%. The left alliance has been predicted to follow on about 27% and Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrists behind on about 21%. Results Constituency results will trickle in throughout Sunday evening. A small number of candidates may be elected in the first round. This will depend on voter turnout. To win a seat in the first round, a candidate must score more than 50% of the votes cast, but they must also reach 25% of the total number of registered voters in that constituency. A high turnout makes it easier to reach that threshold of 25%. The far-right leader Marine Le Pen is hoping to be elected in her northern constituency in the first-round and hopes several of her outgoing MPs will do the same. The left is hoping to see some MPs elected on Sunday night, particularly in Paris and its eastern and northern outskirts. Second-round runoffs Most constituencies will go to a second round runoff on 7 July. The two top candidates will go through to the runoff, as well as any candidate who scores more than 12.5% of the total number of registered voters in that constituency. A high turnout would make that 12.5% threshold easier to reach. There could be a significant number of constituencies facing a runoff between three or more candidates on 7 July. This could result in bartering on the left, traditional right and centre over whether one of the candidates should stand down in order not to split the vote against the far right. The bartering and tactical strategy among some parties will begin on Sunday night. The final list of candidates who will stand in the second round runoff will be known on Tuesday evening."

            "content": "At a smart party venue overlooking the woodland of the Bois de Vincennes, east of Paris, members of Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (Rassemblement National, or RN) clinked glasses to the sound of jazz piano. Savouring their historic result in the European elections, they were also looking forward with excitement to the sudden, shock parliamentary election in France. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for power if French people put their trust in us,\u201d said Le Pen to cheers and applause from senior party officials in suits and cocktail dresses, after the president, Emmanuel Macron, made the dramatic and unexpected announcement that he was dissolving the French parliament in the wake of the results. The election, called for three weeks\u2019 time, saw Le Pen\u2019s anti-immigration party, with around 31% of the vote, come first \u2013 and more than double the score of the president\u2019s pro-European centrists. Smiling, Le Pen said her party best represented France and had succeeded in capturing French people\u2019s daily concerns, which her party officials say are immigration, the cost of living and a feeling of insecurity and fear of crime. \u201cWhen the people vote, the people win,\u201d she said. The RN\u2019s European score of over 30% is an unprecedented high for the party, a clear defeat for Macron and, in the words of one senior party member, a \u201cstepping stone\u201d to the presidential election in three years\u2019 time. But few among the elected officials and canvassers who had gathered at the celebration party overlooking one of Paris\u2019s most picturesque parks had expected Macron to drop the bombshell of dissolving the French parliament on Sunday night. As the president made the announcement on television, a roar of cheers went up across the room. It was exactly what Le Pen had wanted Macron to do \u2013 the RN has 88 members of parliament and is currently the biggest single opposition party in parliament. Le Pen said this score could now be vastly increased to \u201cconsecrate our movement as the great alternative political force\u201d in France. Macron\u2019s party, which for the past two years has struggled with no absolute majority in parliament, could not have limped on, a party adviser said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard to stop us now,\u201d said Aymeric Durox, an RN senator. The 38-year-old former history teacher in the well-heeled town of Fontainebleau had seen first-hand how this European election had won over new higher-earning, highly educated voters and public-sector workers. \u201cWe\u2019re everywhere now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no more fortress that is impossible for us to take. We have voters in every sector of life, every profession.\u201d Durox said the significant rise in teachers who voted for the party in the last French presidential election in 2022 had already shown that the party could reach beyond its traditional heartlands. \u201cIt\u2019s something that a few years ago would have been unthinkable,\u201d he said. When Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old party president who led the European election campaign, strode into the room to give a triumphant victory speech, he was accompanied by some of the RN\u2019s parliamentarians to send a message about the party\u2019s position not just in Europe, but in France. Behind him, a screen read: \u201cFrance is back.\u201d Bardella is credited with appealing to voters who would have been put off by Jean-Marie Le Pen. He does not seek to dilute the party\u2019s hardline anti-immigration message, which has not changed since the 1970s; instead he wants to make it respectable and fully mainstream. \u201cFrench citizens have shown tonight that they want change,\u201d Bardella said. \u201cTonight a wind of hope has risen over France and it is only just beginning.\u201d He said the European vote was a \u201crepudiation and clear rejection\u201d of Macron\u2019s politics. \u201cTonight, Emmanuel Macron is a weakened president. He already lacked an absolute majority in parliament, and now his margin for action has shrunk at the heart of the European parliament,\u201d Bardella said. For months, Le Pen has been suggesting that Bardella \u2013 who was elected to the European parliament five years ago when he was 23 and has very high popularity ratings \u2013 could be a potential prime minister. Now, senior party figures were putting Bardella forward as the figurehead for the new parliamentary campaign. Near the cheese platter, the carefully laid-out designer finger-food and chardonnay wine in ice buckets, a young advertising executive from Normandy said his feeling from his months canvassing on the European campaign trail was that the party had been swelled by rural and farming communities expressing anger at Macron, but also by new professionals who had never before voted for the RN. \u201cBefore, we had an electorate that was more working class. Now we\u2019re attracting managers, senior staff in big companies,\u201d he said. He had seen local membership in his branch of the party in Calvados rise from six people to 51 in less than a year. \u201cI joined the party six years ago and I\u2019ve seen a change. It\u2019s interesting how renaming the party and getting rid of the old name, Front National, has made a difference. The driving force of our ideas has remained the same: security and the fight against mass immigration.\u201d Gilles Penelle, an RN regional councillor in Brittany and senior party official, said the RN\u2019s growing support in places such as Brittany, once a pro-European stronghold for Macron\u2019s centrists, showed that \u201cthere is a message being sent that there is a countryside in France that feels abandoned, and forgotten, even in Brittany. When you take away the city of Rennes and the tourist coast, there is another Brittany that no one\u2019s talking about \u2013 that Brittany is not on the postcards, it\u2019s suffering, it feels forgotten, abandoned.\u201d Penelle said Macron was now facing an \u201cnational political crisis\u201d unprecedented in modern France. He said the president had had no choice but to call a parliamentary election in France because the governing centrists\u2019 poor performance was directly attributable Macron himself, and his prime minister, Gabriel Attal, who had been actively campaigning. \u201cThis party is at the gates of power in France,\u201d said Herv\u00e9 Moreau, a former senior gendarme from Burgundy who recently joined the RN. He said its result in the European elections meant that \u201cin people\u2019s minds, this party is the political alternative\u201d."

            "date": "2024-06-24T03:43:47Z",
            "content": "The federal Labor government has appointed prominent New South Wales Liberal Matt Kean as the new chair of the Climate Change Authority. Here\u2019s a short explainer on Kean and the agency he will chair. Who is Matt Kean? Kean, 42, had been a Liberal MP in the NSW parliament until announcing his resignation last week. He gave his valedictory speech to parliament on Friday. Kean entered politics in the 2011 landslide as the member for Hornsby, a seat in northern Sydney. His first major appointment was as minister for innovation and better regulation in 2017, a role that suited his education, including gaining a graduate diploma from the Institute of Chartered Accountants and his time at consultants PriceWaterhouseCoopers. He found his calling and gained a higher profile after the 2019 state election when he became energy and environment minister. As head of the Liberal\u2019s moderate faction, and being close to then-premier Gladys Berejiklian, Kean was able to implement far-reaching changes \u2013 particularly in the energy sector \u2013 that had eluded similarly inclined moderate Liberal ministers. He secured cross-party support for an ambitious road map to drive renewables into the grid in NSW \u2013 a state that had been slow to decarbonise \u2013 and a large expansion of national parks. Increasingly alarmed at the scale of the 2019-20 black summer bushfires, Kean spoke out against the lack of climate action including by his federal counterparts in the Morrison government. Morrison bristled in response that \u201cmost of the federal cabinet wouldn\u2019t even know who Matt Kean was\u201d \u2013 helping to boost Kean\u2019s national profile. When Berejiklian resigned following revelations the state\u2019s corruption commission was investigating whether she had been involved in \u201ca breach of public trust\u201d, Kean was elevated to treasurer and deputy Liberal leader under Dominic Perrottet. After the March 2023 election ended the Coalition\u2019s 12 years in office, Kean took a much less publicised role as shadow health minister. Why did Kean leave politics now? Kean had made no secret of his wider ambitions \u2013 including a potential tilt at federal politics. He could have chosen to challenge sitting Liberal MP Paul Fletcher for pre-selection in the federal seat of Bradfield, for example, arguing his track record on tackling climate action would help counter any threat posed by an independent teal candidate. However, Kean\u2019s climate stance would have put him at odds with the federal opposition, not least its plans to build nuclear power plants at seven sites across Australia. Close observers have noted Kean\u2019s resignation as a Liberal MP came just a day before that policy was announced. It also came not long after Peter Dutton announced a federal Coalition government would ditch Australia\u2019s 2030 emissions target under the Paris climate agreement. \u201cMy grandparents\u2019 generation fought for freedom in the second world war,\u201d Kean said in his valedictory speech. \u201cMy parents\u2019 generation saw off the threat of communism during the cold war. \u201cIt is incumbent upon our generation to take decisive and responsible action on climate change. It is the biggest challenge that will face our society and economy in our lifetime.\u201d Speaking on Monday after his new role as the chair of the Climate Change Authority was announced, Kean noted he had previously asked his state\u2019s chief scientist, Prof Hugh Durrant-Whyte, to examine nuclear\u2019s prospects. (Durrant-Whyte reiterated the points here last week.) Standing alongside the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, in Canberra, Kean said nuclear energy didn\u2019t make economic sense. \u201cI did not want to bankrupt the state and I did not want to put those huge costs on to families.\u201d What is the Climate Change Authority? The authority was set up by the Gillard Labor government in 2012 to provide independent advice on what Australia\u2019s carbon emissions reduction targets should be. The Abbott government sought to scrap the authority \u2013 and other emissions-reducing bodies such as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation \u2013 but was stymied by the Senate. However, the Coalition made it clear the authority\u2019s advice wasn\u2019t welcomed, with one after another of the authority\u2019s board members resigning, including former Reserve Bank governor Bernie Fraser. Since April 2021, the authority has been chaired by Grant King, a former managing director of Origin Energy for 16 years. During that time, Origin expanded rapidly, particularly in coal seam gas for export. King, though, has held other roles, including chairing CWP Renewables, and Kean too may take up roles in clean energy. King\u2019s term was scheduled to run until April next year but Bowen said the current chair had sought to leave the role early. The authority reviews Australia\u2019s national greenhouse gas reporting and the safeguard mechanism aimed at forcing industry to cut carbon emissions over time. It can also order its own research or act on requests for analysis from the government. Perhaps as a signal to how Kean will view his new role as authority chair, he had this to say in his valedictory speech: \u201cFor critics who complain of an economic and financial cost of acting on climate change, I say as treasurer I saw the catastrophic cost of not acting\u2014the cost of rebuilding infrastructure, towns, lives and livelihoods. There is no comparison.\u201d"

The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, revealed the appointment on Monday at a news conference with Kean and federal climate change minister, Chris Bowen. Bowen acknowledged Kean was from the opposite side of politics. \u201cCarbon dioxide doesn\u2019t recognise political parties,\u201d he said. Kean announced last week that he was leaving politics to pursue work in the private sector but acknowledged he will continue to be in the public sector instead. \u201cThe Climate Change Authority has an important role to play in providing independent advice to the government of the day, based on facts science, evidence, engineering, and economics,\u201d Kean said. \u201cWe have an opportunity to become a stronger and even more prosperous nation, we have an opportunity to deliver a family some of the cheapest electricity bills anywhere in the world. But we\u2019ve got to get it right. This is too important to leave to chance. We need policies based on facts and evidence. And that\u2019s what I intend to be advising the government.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Asked about the federal Coalition\u2019s plan to introduce nuclear energy, Kean said that the advice to him when he was NSW energy minister considering the transition away from coal was that it was too costly and would take too long. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to bankrupt the state.\u201d Kean said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want to put those huge costs on to families.\u201d That advice had come from the then NSW chief scientist in 2019. But Kean said the most current available advice supported that view. \u201cThe latest scientific engineering and economic advice that\u2019s looked at these matters that I\u2019m aware of is from the CSIRO and Aemo, and they very clearly say that the cheapest way to transition our electricity system is to move towards renewables backed up by firming, and also storage,\u201d Kean said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the CSIRO says that\u2019s what Aemo says. That\u2019s the evidence available to us. I\u2019m not aware of anything different.\u201d Albanese described it as \u201can outstanding appointment\u201d and said Kean was \u201cuniquely placed\u201d to take on the job, having served at the state level in the treasury, energy and environment portfolios. \u201cMr Kean understands the opportunity that the transition to clean energy represents for our nation,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cHe understood it as a member of the NSW government \u2026 and he also understands the folly that walking away from the renewables transition represents for our nation.\u201d Kean called for a bipartisan consensus in the transition away from fossil fuels. \u201cThis is not about ideology, this is about outcomes,\u201d Kean said.

            "content": "When we think about who gave voice to women during their fight for the right to vote, or their battle to legalise abortion, those in the arts have often been at the forefront. Likewise the Black Panthers in the US civil rights movement and people with Aids shunned by the government. Artists haven\u2019t only captured political shifts \u2013 their work has changed vital conversations. At times, they have even changed laws. Paula Rego\u2019s agonising depictions of women going through unsafe illegal abortions helped sway public opinion in Portugal\u2019s 2007 referendum on legalising the practice. The one-woman show Prima Facie, by Suzie Miller, about a female barrister and sexual abuse survivor, exposed flaws in the law when it comes to rape victims. By asking the accused if consent was given, it influenced a senior British judge to rewrite the direction read to the jury during rape cases. Art and artists can have a huge influence. Right now, the climate emergency is one of the most pressing crises the world faces. In the UK, 2022 and 2023 were the hottest and second-hottest years on record. A wet spring has caused potato shortages, triggering increases in food prices. And, as the 2022 UK Climate Change Risk Assessment lays out, there are increasing risks to livestock, soil health, freshwater habits, food chains, human health and wellbeing. How can artists push conversations and persuade people to take action about these problems? In 1984, Agnes Denes drew attention to capitalist greed and the gap between the urban and rural environment by planting and harvesting a two-acre wheatfield in Battery Park, Manhattan. Four months in the making, it highlighted mismanagement of land and, as the artist said, \u201cour misplaced priorities and deteriorating human values\u201d. Judy Chicago\u2019s drawing series, The End: A Meditation on Death and Extinction, part of her current show at the Serpentine in London, depicts flora and fauna under threat of extinction, giving a voice to nature that is slowly being eaten away by this crisis. While it\u2019s important that artists of all kinds document what is happening, urgent action is required too. I recently went to the launch of Murmur, a climate initiative and grant-providing scheme pushing for the decarbonisation of the arts and music industries. While some artists have been doing this work for a long time, it\u2019s important for them to harness their influence. As founder Victoria Siddall, the former director of the Frieze art fair, stresses: \u201cArt and artists have a special power to inspire people.\u201d It is sad that we need these organisations. But their existence is a result of the dangerous lack of activity from our current government. The prime minister downplayed the climate crisis in the Conservative manifesto and has U-turned on his strategy, prioritising cost over the planet. Nor does he seem to fully recognise that high oil and gas prices are driving the cost-of-living crisis. All this despite a public letter signed by 408 scientists urging party leaders to make climate a top priority. \u201cIt is very clear,\u201d they wrote, \u201cthat a failure to tackle climate change with sufficient urgency and scale is making the UK and the rest of the world more dangerous and insecure.\u201d On Saturday, London Climate Action Week began, packing the city full of events and discussions about how we can do better, and next week\u2019s general election is the most crucial vote of our generation. In these times, we need to use all the resources we can to shift the conversation and take action. Like Suzie Miller changing judges\u2019 directions or Paula Rego influencing Portuguese law, art can be a powerful tool. But individuals, leaders and organisations must use their influence, too. Climate must be prioritised. If not, what will artists of the future have to document? Will there even be any? You can\u2019t document extinction if you\u2019ve ceased to exist."

            "content": "The proverb \u201cone swallow doesn\u2019t make a summer\u201d, first attributed to Aristotle, sums up our love of this elegant bird. Swallows visit us for roughly half the year, between April and September, before travelling almost 6,000 miles (10,000 km) to South Africa, where they enjoy a second spring and summer. But unpredictable weather patterns are now affecting swallows throughout their lifecycle: in Africa, on their journeys south in autumn and north in spring, and during the breeding season here in the UK. A mixture of wet springs and summer droughts, leading to major falls in numbers of the flying insects on which they feed, has reduced the swallow\u2019s breeding population by almost a quarter in the past 25 years or so. Anecdotally, many of my farming neighbours here in Somerset tell me they have far fewer nesting swallows than before; some have even lost them altogether. And a recent report confirms that those other familiar denizens of our summer skies, the house martin and swift, have suffered even greater falls in numbers over the past decade. Once again, our changing climate is to blame; but this comes on top of the huge loss of insects caused by modern industrial agriculture. This is ironic, given that the swallow\u2019s success over the past few millennia began when it adapted to living alongside farmers, nesting in their barns, and feeding on insects attracted by their livestock."

            "date": "2024-06-12T17:03:43Z",
            "content": "Swiss politicians have rejected a landmark climate ruling from the European court of human rights, raising fears that other polluting countries may follow suit. A panel of Strasbourg judges ruled in April that Switzerland had violated the human rights of older women through weak climate policies that leave them more vulnerable to heatwaves. Activists hailed the judgment as a breakthrough because it leaves all members of the Council of Europe exposed to legal challenges for sluggish efforts to clean up carbon-intensive economies. But the Swiss parliament\u2019s lower house voted on Wednesday to disregard the ruling \u2013 with 111 votes in favour and 72 against \u2013 arguing that the judges had overstepped their bounds and that Switzerland had done enough. The declaration, which has been adopted by the upper house but does not bind the federal government, accused the court of \u201cinadmissible and disproportionate judicial activism\u201d. \u201cThis is terrible from a rule-of-law perspective,\u201d said Corina Heri, a law researcher at the University of Z\u00fcrich, adding that \u201cthe whole system would fall apart\u201d if lots of states started to pick and choose which rulings they complied with. \u201cThe term \u2018slippery slope\u2019 is overused, obviously, but it is a dangerous precedent to create.\u201d The KlimaSeniorinnen \u2013 or Swiss female climate elders \u2013 are a group of 2,400 women over the age of 65 who took the Swiss government to court for failing to do its fair share to stop the planet heating 1.5C (2.7F). After years of setbacks in regional and national courts, they escalated the case to Europe\u2019s top human rights court and scored a partial victory. But in a fiery debate on Wednesday, Swiss politicians attacked the court and mocked the women. Jean-Luc Addor, from the rightwing populist Swiss People\u2019s Party, the largest in the federal assembly, said: \u201cThese \u2018climate elder\u2019 are just a bunch of apparently healthy \u201cboomeuses\u201d [female boomers], who are trying to deny our children the living conditions they have enjoyed all their lives.\u201d Scientists have found that older women die at higher rates during heatwaves, which have grown hotter, longer and more common as people have pumped out pollutants that trap sunlight. A study from doctors and climate scientists found 60% of the heatwave deaths in Switzerland in summer 2022 were the result of climate change and that older women were hit hardest. Ahead of the debate, the KlimaSeniorinnen and Greenpeace submitted a petition with 22,000 signatures urging politicians to recognise that human rights are the basis of democracy and should be independent of political majorities. Rosmarie Wydler-W\u00e4lti, co-president of the KlimaSeniorinnen, said she was appalled by the declaration, and that it was not worthy of a constitutional state. \u201cThe declaration is a betrayal of us older women \u2013 and of all those who are suffering from the real consequences of global warming today and in the future.\u201d The vote comes days after the far-right scored sizable gains in European Union elections. Switzerland, which is not part of the EU, will mark the 50th anniversary of its ratification of the European convention on human rights in November. The convention legally commits it to implementing the court\u2019s judgments. Evelyne Schmid, a professor of international law at the University of Lausanne, said small states such as Switzerland have a particular interest in respecting international treaties \u2013 and that the declaration from politicians will put the federal government in a difficult position. \u201cMembers of parliament and everyone else can criticise judgments they don\u2019t like \u2013 that\u2019s of course legitimate in a democracy, and courts exist precisely for situations in which there is disagreement,\u201d said Schmid. \u201cBut a parliament officially accusing the institution of \u2018undue judicial activism\u2019 sends a different, problematic message.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-07T14:00:18Z",
            "content": "The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has warned that the spread of artificial intelligence technology multiplies the threat of nuclear war, and that humanity is now \u201con a knife\u2019s edge\u201d as dangers to its existence coalesce. Guterres\u2019s warning is due to be shown on a recorded video to be played on Friday morning at the annual meeting of the US Arms Control Association (ACA) in Washington. In the video, the secretary general makes his most impassioned plea to date for the nuclear weapons states to take their non-proliferation obligations seriously, and in particular, agree on a mutual pledge not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. \u201cThe regime designed to prevent the use, testing and proliferation of nuclear weapons is weakening,\u201d Guterres says in the recorded message, in a warning that comes with some 600 days to go before the expiry of the 2010 New Start accord between the US and Russia, the last remaining agreement limiting the strategic arsenals of the two nuclear superpowers. Moscow has taken to making frequent threats of nuclear use, and China\u2019s stockpile, while small compared with those of the US and Russia, is growing steadily. More than 30 years since the end of the cold war, the US and Russia keep many of their intercontinental ballistic missiles on a hair-trigger alert, ready to launch at a few minutes\u2019 warning. There are fears that in the drive to bolster each nation\u2019s deterrent, launch procedures are being streamlined potentially with the help of AI. \u201cHumanity is on a knife\u2019s edge; the risk of a nuclear weapon being used has reached heights not seen since the cold war,\u201d Guterres says in his ACA address. \u201cStates are engaged in a qualitative arms race. Technologies like artificial intelligence are multiplying the danger.\u201d \u201cAll countries must agree that any decision on nuclear use is made by humans, not machines or algorithms,\u201d Guterres insisted. Two years ago, the US, UK and France issued a joint statement on the need to \u201cmaintain human control\u201d of nuclear launches. Russia and China have yet to issue any comparable declaration. According to estimates by the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), the number of nuclear weapons has declined dramatically since the cold war from a 1986 peak of about 70,300 weapons in 1986 to an estimated 12,100 this year. The total inventory continues to fall gradually as retired weapons are dismantled, but the total military stockpile of warheads available for use has begun to increase again, after the long post-cold war decline, the FAS warned. Guterres said it was the responsibility of nuclear weapons states to lead a return to disarmament. \u201cThey must resume dialogue and commit to preventing any use of a nuclear weapon,\u201d he said. \u201cI also urge the United States and the Russian Federation to get back to the negotiating table, fully implement the New Start treaty and agree on its successor.\u201d At last year\u2019s ACA meeting, the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, offered to engage in talks \u201cwithout preconditions\u201d on a new agreement to replace New Start, but the Kremlin has rejected the offer. Guterres also repeated his previous appeals for the nuclear powers to reaffirm a moratorium on nuclear testing, and to \u201cagree that none will be the first to launch\u201d a nuclear warhead. Earlier this year, China suggested a \u201cno first use\u201d treaty. The US responded by saying it was ready to engage in a discussion on the subject. Mallory Stewart, an assistant secretary of state, told the ACA in April she \u201cwould love to ask\u201d Chinese officials about the idea in the context of a broader conversation about strategic risks. But US officials say there has not so far been a \u201csubstantive response\u201d to the US suggestion of a dialogue, and has not so far agreed to arrange a sequel to a bilateral arms control meeting held last November."

            "date": "2024-06-25T19:36:04Z",
            "content": "A two-page letter written by Albert Einstein warning Franklin D Roosevelt \u2013 then the president of the US \u2013 that Nazi Germany might harness nuclear research to invent an atomic bomb is going up for sale at Christie\u2019s auctioneers in September with an estimate value of $4m. Einstein\u2019s letter \u2013 one of two the theoretical physicist drafted in a cabin on the north shore of New York\u2019s Long Island with a fellow scientist, Leo Szilard \u2013 warned that the German government was actively supporting nuclear research and could make \u201cextremely powerful bombs\u201d like the kind that were eventually deployed by the US at the end of the second world war. He urged the US government to do the same. And Roosevelt responded by forming a committee that was a forerunner to the J Robert Oppenheimer-headed Manhattan Project which built the bombs that were dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, ending the second world war and ushering in the nuclear age. The letter that the father of the theory of general relativity about space and time sent to the president is at the Roosevelt library and museum in Hyde Park, New York. But the second version \u2013 signed and slightly shorter \u2013 is being sold off by the estate of the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Allen, a kind of magpie collector who amassed a collection of art that was recently sold off at Christie\u2019s for $1.6bn as well as almost anything pertaining to Jimi Hendrix, purchased the letter from publisher and third-party presidential candidate Malcolm Forbes in 2002 for $2.1m. The Wall Street Journal said that was the first 20th-century historical document to top $1m. Forbes had previously acquired it from the estate of Szilard. Christie\u2019s has a history with Einstein memorabilia. It previously sold the physicist\u2019s so-called God Letter \u2013 in which he wrote that \u201cthe word God is for me nothing but the expression and product of human weakness\u201d \u2013 for almost $3m in 2018. But the letter is unlikely to break the $13m record set in 2021 for one of the few surviving records detailing his theory of general relativity. With the market for visual art under stress, the auction house anticipates that the market for historical artefacts could attract bidders, especially one as prescient to current concerns about a new, three-way nuclear arms race between the US, Russia and China, alongside the success of last year\u2019s Oscar-winning Oppenheimer biopic. Marc Porter, chairman of Christie\u2019s Americas, told the Journal that Allen \u201cundoubtedly knew it was one of the most important documents in the history of the 20th century, and that\u2019s not the kind of thing you just hang in your office\u201d. Allen, he said, had stored the letter carefully and away from sunlight. The letter, dated 2 August 1939, less than a month before Germany invaded Poland, begins, \u201cSir: Recent work in nuclear physics made it probable that uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy.\u201d In the letter that was sent to Roosevelt, Einstein wrote: \u201cIt may be possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium \u2026 and this new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs.\u201d Nuclear reaction is currently on the mind of Allen\u2019s Microsoft partner Bill Gates, who recently announced he was prepared to invest billions into a next-generation nuclear power plant project in Wyoming. Gates told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation that his startup TerraPower expected to complete the new reactor that uses liquid sodium instead of water as a coolant in 2030. \u201cI put in over a billion, and I\u2019ll put in billions more,\u201d Gates said. That comes as companies like Microsoft and Google have expressed interest in a new generation of nuclear power plants to meet escalating demands for power to run data-storage centers that is expected to dramatically increase. The International Energy Agency has estimated that global electricity demand from AI, data centers and crypto will at minimum rise to 800TWh, or terawatt hours, in 2026, a nearly 75% increase from 460TWh in 2022."

            "date": "2024-06-25T15:00:33Z",
            "content": "There is no chance nuclear energy will get online in time to replace retiring coal-fired power plants and any delays in rolling out renewables will likely lead to higher costs and interrupted grid supply, the market operator has warned. \u201cThe possibility that replacement generation is not available when coal power stations retire is real and growing, and a risk that must be avoided,\u201d the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) said in its Integrated System Plan (ISP). \u201cThe sooner firmed renewables are connected, the more secure the energy transition will be.\u201d Aemo\u2019s grid blueprint, published Wednesday, echoed the draft version released in December. That report said all coal power stations would shut by 2o38 under Aemo\u2019s most likely scenario, but new wind and solar farms need to double their current pace of construction to 6 gigawatts a year to 2050 to meet decarbonisation goals. Solar and wind farms will need to rise six-fold by 2050 to reach 58GW and 69GW, respectively. Rooftop solar should roughly quadruple to 72GW by then, the report said. The 25-year plan did not model nuclear energy because the technology isn\u2019t policy for any federal or state government and is banned. Aemo said nuclear was \u201cone of the most expensive ways to generate electricity\u201d, citing a CSIRO report. \u201c[The] time it would take to design and build nuclear generation would be too slow to replace retiring coal-fired generation,\u201d Aemo noted in an accompanying factsheet. The ISP, released every two years, will likely stoke the intense political debate over Australia\u2019s energy future. The federal opposition last week announced plans to build nuclear generation on the sites of seven existing or closed coal plants without detailing their size, cost or impact on existing or future renewable investments. The energy minister, Chris Bowen, said Aemo\u2019s findings were in \u201cstark contrast\u201d to the Coalition\u2019s nuclear plan. Bowen claimed the Coalition policy would \u201csee Australians pay hundreds of billions for the reactors alone\u201d, which he said could provide \u201cat best\u201d 4% of Australia\u2019s energy needs by 2050. It might add $1,000 a year to people\u2019s energy bills, he said. Aemo\u2019s report also included an estimated benefit for each tonne of carbon dioxide avoided. As reported by Guardian Australia in April, market rules set the price at $70 a tonne, rising to $420 tonne by 2050 when Australia aims to reach net zero emissions. That change boosted the net benefits of the 10,000km of new transmission lines by $3.3bn to $22bn compared with the draft ISP. Renewable energy supplied almost 40% of electricity across the national electricity market (Nem) in 2023, and briefly topped 72% last October. The government is aiming for 82% of the Nem to be supplied by clean energy by 2030. \u201cAlready this decade, 12.5GW of new utility-scale generation and 1.3GW/1.8GWh of storage has entered the Nem and 490km of transmission has been built,\u201d it said. \u201cA further 20GW of generation and storage, and 2,090km of transmission, are progressing from planning to delivery.\u201d The market will also need 15GW of gas-fired generation by 2050, up from 11.5GW now, even if rarely used. Those plants may be fuelled by fossil gas, biomethane or even hydrogen. \u201cThis gas generation is a strategic reserve for power system reliability and security, so is not forecast to run frequently,\u201d Aemo said. \u201cA typical gas generator may generate just 5% of its annual potential, but will be critical when it runs\u201d particularly in winter. Nem regions will need more than 60,000 people to build and maintain energy infrastructure over the next 20 years. \u201cThe transition will have undeniable benefits,\u201d Aemo said. \u201cLower cost, lower emission renewables will offer homes and businesses the electricity they need, with greater insulation from international price shocks that can put unwelcome pressure on the cost of living.\u201d Anna Malos, Australia lead at Climateworks Centre, said the centre\u2019s modelling \u2013 which helped inform Aemo\u2019s report \u2013 found nuclear energy would \u201cbe much more expensive than renewables\u201d for the grid to reach zero emissions. It was also presumed to be unavailable before 2040, meaning carbon budgets would be blown as more coal and gas would be burned for power generation. \u201cThe grid is very largely decarbonised by the time nuclear becomes available,\u201d Malos said."

That will do nothing for national security, Keir Starmer, 5 June). In 2014, Vladimir Putin made it clear that Russia needs neutral buffer states such as Ukraine. Russia lost about 27 million citizens last time it was invaded. It does not have the luxury of oceans on two sides and friendly neighbours on the other two. It would have been simple for Nato and Putin to negotiate neutrality guarantees, but instead Nato pursued a policy intended to plant missiles on the Russian border. The US knew such a policy would force Putin to act, thereby donating the \u201cmoral high ground\u201d to the west. The responsibility for this war in Ukraine lies not with Russia but the US. It is not Russia that poses a threat to world peace, but US militarism. Andrew Aikman Forres, Moray \u2022 Jeremy Corbyn is right \u2013 our political leaders are sticking their heads deeply in the sand. He could have added that if it\u2019s possible for something to go wrong then you can be certain that one day it will. We may escape nuclear war, but accidental nuclear attack will, one day, happen. We\u2019ve been extremely lucky to have escaped this so far, but eventually our luck will run out, unless we put a stop to this madness. Norman Rimmell Darley Dale, Derbyshire \u2022 \u201cThere are several examples that show the threat of nuclear retaliation has failed to deter an invasion,\u201d says Jeremy Corbyn. This misrepresents the significance of nuclear weapons. The key point is: no nuclear-armed country has ever been invaded. This is the deterrent power of these awful weapons, and history shows them to have been highly effective in their role as defensive weapons. Alex Hamilton Killarney Heights, Sydney, Australia \u2022 Jeremy Corbyn writes: \u201cSecurity is not the ability to threaten and destroy your neighbour. Security is getting on with your neighbour.\u201d This may be true in the comfortable world of Islington, but how does Mr Corbyn propose that the people of Ukraine, the Baltic states or Poland \u2013 and ultimately the UK \u2013 \u201cget on\u201d with Vladimir Putin and his forces?

            "date": "2024-06-18T22:44:43Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, widely tipped to play a leading role in a second Trump presidency, has advocated the resumption of nuclear testing, and the possible renewed production of plutonium and weapons-grade uranium. Arms control experts said O\u2019Brien\u2019s proposals would accelerate the global nuclear arms race and backfire in terms of US security, handing greater advantages to Russia and China. O\u2019Brien spelled out what he thought a Trump national security policy would look like in an article for the journal Foreign Affairs, entitled The Return of Peace Through Strength. In the article, O\u2019Brien argued that Trump\u2019s hawkish stance had kept US adversaries in check, and that Biden\u2019s relative weakness had emboldened them. The piece does not mention the progress Iran made in its nuclear programme after Trump pulled out of a 2015 multilateral nuclear agreement with Tehran, or the growth in Chinese and North Korean arsenals during the Trump years. As part of a policy of signalling strength, O\u2019Brien argued, the US should abandon the moratorium on nuclear testing it has observed since 1992, maintaining it despite the Senate\u2019s refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. \u201cWashington must test new nuclear weapons for reliability and safety in the real world for the first time since 1992 \u2013 not just by using computer models,\u201d said O\u2019Brien, who served as national security adviser from 2019 to 2021. He added: \u201cIf China and Russia continue to refuse to engage in good-faith arms-control talks, the United States should also resume production of uranium-235 and plutonium-239, the primary fissile isotopes of nuclear weapons.\u201d According to the Federation of American Scientists, the US currently has a total inventory of 5,044 warheads, while Russia has 5,580 and China 500. O\u2019Brien argued that the US should maintain \u201ctechnical and numerical superiority to the combined Chinese and Russian nuclear stockpiles\u201d, suggesting a significant expansion of the current American arsenal. Such a policy would be in sharp contrast with that of the Biden administration. The current national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told the Arms Control Association (ACA) last year: \u201cThe United States does not need to increase our nuclear forces to outnumber the combined total of our competitors in order to successfully deter them. We\u2019ve been there. We\u2019ve learned that lesson.\u201d Earlier this month, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, told the ACA that the nuclear weapons powers \u201cmust reaffirm [the] moratorium on nuclear testing, and they must accelerate the implementation of the disarmament commitments made under the Nonproliferation Treaty\u201d. He warned that humanity was \u201con a knife edge\u201d in the face of a potential resumption of a nuclear arms race and advances in artificial intelligence. Daryl Kimball, the head of the ACA, described O\u2019Brien\u2019s article as \u201cdangerous, counterproductive, Dr Strangelove thinking\u201d. \u201cNo one wins a nuclear arms race, folks,\u201d Kimball said on the X social media platform. Jeffrey Lewis, a professor and nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California, said a resumption of testing around the world would throw away US advantages that were locked in when the moratorium began more than three decades ago. \u201cWhen the test ban happened, the US had done more than 1,000 explosions and had the most advanced computing capabilities in the world, so we had the best data and the best computers, and we were in a position of enormous advantage relative to the Russians, and certainly relative to the Chinese,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe Russians had conducted a smaller number of nuclear explosions, and I think that they were not as well-instrumented as ours were \u2026 and then the Chinese were way behind,\u201d he added. \u201cChina now has supercomputers comparable to the ones in the US, and so the Chinese laboratories would learn vast amounts about miniaturising nuclear weapons, [and about] making nuclear weapons more reliable, that we already know in the US. Whereas, comparatively, we would learn very, very little.\u201d Lewis said making more fissile material would be pointless. The US is estimated to have a stockpile of 87.6 tonnes of plutonium and 483 tonnes of highly enriched uranium, enough for tens of thousands more warheads without the need to make any more. Lewis said the main point of the O\u2019Brien article was to appeal to \u201can audience of one\u201d \u2013 Trump \u2013 by putting forward radical ideas that spur outrage from liberals and the arms-control community. He likened it to the punk rock movement: \u201cPutting a safety pin through your ear is not because you think it looks good or it feels good, but because it outrages the normies.\u201d"

            "content": "Unemployment is rising in the UK at the fastest pace among 38 of the world\u2019s richest countries, according to an analysis by the Trades Union Congress (TUC). In a release a day before official labour market figures are expected to show another increase in joblessness in Britain, the union body looked at data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) covering the first three months of this year. It found that of its 38 member states, only Costa Rica suffered a similar rise in the number of people losing their jobs between the start of January and the end of March. Every region of the UK was affected by rising unemployment and a falling number of job vacancies, the TUC said, illustrating the dislocation in the labour market between employers who cannot find workers with the right skills and rising joblessness. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to be published on Tuesday are expected to show a further rise in unemployment in recent months in a blow to Rishi Sunak\u2019s message that the economy is growing robustly. The ONS confirmed last month that the economy had exited last year\u2019s recession, growing by 0.6% in the first quarter of the year, and surveys of business leaders show rising levels of confidence about the prospects for economic growth. Consumer confidence has also risen this year in response to a rising level of average disposable incomes. However, employers have indicated that despite the recovery, they are seeking to reduce their headcount. Separate research by the Chartered Institute of Management (CMI) found that in the first three months of this year, more UK employers were drawing up plans to make roles redundant and impose hiring freezes than in the same period last year. The CMI survey of just under 1,000 British managers found that 35% of organisations planned to either freeze (21%) or reduce (14%) recruitment in the following six months. In the same period last year the combined total was 24%, while in the summer of 2022 it was just 15%, indicating a rising trend in the number of employers wanting to restrict or cut numbers of staff. When asked for the reasons behind the decision to freeze or reduce recruitment, three in five managers (60%) blamed worsening revenues or rising costs, while 55% cited organisational restructuring to reduce costs, and 34% said it was due to increased economic uncertainty. One in five managers also cited higher staff pay (19%) as the reason for reducing the number of employees, with a smaller number (13%) citing the increased use of digital technology and automation. Public sector employers were more likely to say they were planning to reduce staff numbers, with three-quarters saying budget cuts were the main reason. The research will add to concerns among some Bank of England policymakers about the weakness of the longer-term economic outlook. The central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee will consider at a meeting later this month whether to bring interest rates down from their current level of 5.25%. In its latest labour market release last month, the ONS reported a declining number of job vacancies across the country, falling by 26,000 to 898,000 in the three months to April. The TUC general secretary, Paul Nowak, said the weak jobs figures from the ONS and its analysis showed \u201cjust how out of touch Rishi Sunak and his government are \u2013 and this complacency is costing Britain dear\u201d, adding: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s economic boasts are frankly laughable.\u201d The OECD, which counts the US, France, Germany, Australia and Japan among its members, has urged politicians to invest in workers\u2019 skills to boost employment after many people left the labour market during the Covid-19 pandemic, often as a result of ill health. The Conservative party election manifesto, due to be published on Tuesday, will reportedly include measures that Sunak will claim will save \u00a312bn in benefits by the end of the next parliament by returning or keeping workers in the labour market."

            "date": "2024-06-13T01:45:10Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s unemployment rate eased last month as employers shrugged off rising costs including higher interest bills to keep adding to their workforces. The jobless rate was 4% in May, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. That was in line with economists\u2019 predictions and was a slight drop from April\u2019s 4.1%. The economy added a net 39,700 jobs last month. Economists had predicted the tally of job gains to come in at about 30,000. Full-time roles, which cover 35 hours or more per week, rose by 41,700 in May. Part-time jobs fell by about 2,000, the ABS said. \u201cThe latest jobs numbers show our labour market is an important source of strength in difficult times,\u201d the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said. \u201cDespite our economy weakening substantially as a result of higher interest rates, persistent inflation and ongoing global uncertainty, our labour market remains resilient and that\u2019s clear from today\u2019s result.\u201d Chalmers said 880,000 jobs had been added since Labor won office two years ago \u2013 the most by any first-term government. Labour market figures are among the most closely watched by the Reserve Bank of Australia as it tries to wring inflation from the economy while maintaining as many extra jobs generated since the Covid disruptions as possible. The RBA and Treasury expect the jobless rate to remain at 4% next month before rising to about 4.3% by June 2025. Signs of unemployment rising too quickly would likely increase the chances of a near-term RBA interest rate cut while excessive jobs growth might prompt another cash rate rise to preclude a revival of inflation. Belinda Allen, a senior economist at the Commonwealth Bank, estimated Australia needed to generate about 40,000 extra jobs a month to keep up with the swelling workforce. Investor reaction to Thursday\u2019s news was modest, with the Australian dollar hovering about the 66.5 US cent mark and stocks holding on to most of the morning\u2019s 0.5% gains. That response indicated investors didn\u2019t think the latest jobs figures would sway the RBA much. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The participation rate remained unchanged at 66.7%. The number of hours worked eased back 9m, or little change in a total of almost 2bn. Bjorn Jarvis, the ABS\u2019s head of labour statistics, said the number of those unemployed fell by 9,000 in May, reversing some of April\u2019s 33,000 increase. \u201cThere are now almost 600,000 unemployed people,\u201d Jarvis said. \u201cHowever, that is still nearly 110,000 fewer people than in March 2020, just before the pandemic.\u201d Across the states, Western Australia\u2019s jobless rate last month was the lowest in the nation at 3.6%, improving from April\u2019s 3.9%, seasonally adjusted. New South Wales also posted a drop to 3.8% from April\u2019s 4%, while Victoria went the other way, rising to 4.4% from 4.2% to be the highest in Australia. Queensland, where state polls loom in October, had an unemployment rate of 4%, compared with 4.1% in April. The ACT was steady at 3.8%, the equal second-lowest in the land. Labour market clearly cooling, economists say Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said \u201cit\u2019s clear the labour market is cooling\u201d. \u201cIn trend terms, unemployment rose to 4% from 3.9% previously,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than an uptick of layoffs or redundancies, employers are instead tempering their hiring plans and shaving off the hours they offer to their employees. We see the unemployment rate hitting 4.4% by the end of the year and topping out at 4.5% by the middle of 2025.\u201d Krishna Bhimavarapu, an economist at State Street Global Advisor, said the labor market was cooling faster than during previous adjustments. \u201cThe annual growth in full-time non-seasonally adjusted employment \u2026 is now 85.2% down from its peak in October 2022, greater than the average fall (59.5%) of the nine previous cycles,\u201d Bhimavarapu said. \u201cThe RBA will do well to take that into consideration during their policy discussion next week.\u201d The RBA board meets on 17-18 June and is widely expected to leave the cash rate on hold at 4.35% for a fifth meeting in a row."

            "date": "2024-06-11T08:54:12Z",
            "content": "Private sector employers have cancelled job adverts and shed workers at a steady rate over the last year. According to the latest labour market data covering the three months to the end of April, the number of workers in the manufacturing sector was down from the same month last year. Likewise, retail sector employers have cut jobs, along with the hospitality sector. Perhaps surprisingly, given all the cyber-attacks on UK organisations and the demand for digital workers, the number of IT workers was lower in April than a year ago. Without an increase in the number of people employed across the health service and in education and public administration, the unemployment rate would have jumped by even more than it did. Across all sectors, the number of people unemployed rose by 138,000, taking the total to a little more than 1.5 million and lifting the unemployment rate to 4.4% from 4.3% in March. The data also shows that companies are cutting back on hiring, with the number of vacancies in March to May 2024 falling by 12,000 to 904,000. For the political parties campaigning in the general election, this data shows on the one hand that Rishi Sunak\u2019s administration has put money into prominent areas of the public sector to increase staffing levels. There were 170,000 more health and social care workers in April than a year ago and 70,000 more people working in the education sector. On the other hand, almost every private sector industry cut back on the size of its workforce, indicating that businesses are looking, in some cases, to survive a period of slow growth, while others reduce staff to be more productive and improve their margins. The worst-affected private sector industry was hospitality and hotels, which the Office for National Statistics said has shed almost 80,000 workers in the last year. It is not hard to see why hotel managers would be hoping to be more efficient with the way they employ staff. The sector was at the top of the pay table in April, adding almost 10% to staff wages since last year. While most of this rise can be attributed to the increase in the minimum wage, it illustrates the pressure on businesses when forecasts for the economy show growth staying below 1% this year and not much above that figure next year. The Bank of England will be concerned that wages are still rising at an average level of about 6%. While most analysts expect that figures to slide during the rest of the year as the minimum wage rise begin to have less effect, central bank policymakers will want to delay the first interest rate cut since 2020 until they begin to see it happen. One thing the bank cannot know is how many businesses that pay above the minimum level will need to follow suit. The supermarkets have all increased pay at rates above inflation to stop workers defecting to industries that are catching up in the salary race. If this trend becomes widespread, if only temporary, there will be no cut in the cost of borrowing until August at the earliest, and possibly not until November."

            "date": "2024-06-05T15:25:05Z",
            "content": "It was less than six months ago that Narendra Modi walked solemnly through the ornate surroundings of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state and one of its most politically crucial. His appearance in the holy city to inaugurate the newly constructed Hindu temple, built on the ruins of a mosque demolished two decades earlier, was cast as the pinnacle of the prime minister\u2019s decade in power \u2013 the crowning glory of his Hindu nationalist agenda and his ticket to a third term in office. The ceremony was deemed to mark the unofficial launch of his election campaign. But on Tuesday evening Modi was faced with a rude awakening. His Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), which has ruled India with an iron grip for a decade, has lost its majority as a single party and will have to rely on coalition partners to return to government. The losses were particularly heavy in Uttar Pradesh, long considered to be the BJP\u2019s bastion \u2013 and nowhere more so than in Ayodhya. In the aftermath, few could believe that Ayodhya, the city that had become so closely aligned with Modi\u2019s agenda, could reject the prime minister\u2019s party. Yet the frustrations that led to the BJP losing the Faizabad seat are ones reflected across the state: religious polarisation and pride in the Ram Temple ultimately did not trump anger at rampant unemployment, stagnant wages, and unaffordable inflation. \u201cBhookai piat Bhajan nahi hota [Prayers are not offered by those with hungry stomachs],\u201d became a commonly heard refrain. Many people also expressed anger at the party\u2019s heavy-handed approach to India\u2019s institutions, including the media, which presented an almost uniformly pro-government narrative throughout the election. Among those in Ayodhya who voted against the BJP was Azaan Ahmad Khan, 36, who runs a clothing business. He was \u201cfed up with the dictatorial attitude of the Modi government\u201d, he said, and like most of the city\u2019s people voted for the Samajwadi party, a regional party that is part of the opposition INDIA coalition. \u201cThis government failed to provide jobs or uplift the poor. Instead they started talking about changing the constitution,\u201d said Khan. \u201cI was not very active about political issues previously. But the way Modi has polarised society, people like me worry about the future.\u201d Khan was not alone. While the newly constructed Ram Temple was a point of pride for many in Ayodhya, there was also an overwhelming sense that it was \u201cfor outsiders\u201d, and many complained that religion was no replacement for failures of governance and job creation for people living there. \u201cBuilding the Ram temple will not help me get a job. What will I do with the temple without a job?\u201d said Raj Yadav, 29, who runs a cosmetics store in Ayodhya. He was frustrated that the BJP had not tackled unemployment and inflation and said that recruitment for jobs was \u201ca complete mess\u201d. \u201cThe BJP do not have any vision for the actual development of the country,\u201d he said. Yadav was among those who said that comments made by the local BJP candidate during the campaign, that the party wanted a large majority in order to rewrite India\u2019s constitution, had turned off many. The state of Uttar Pradesh is home to many lower caste communities who began to widely fear that re-writing of the constitution would mean the removals of their protections enshrined in it. \u201cPeople, particularly those from lower castes, were shocked and angry at those comments,\u201d he said. \u201cThe constitution became the biggest issue here among the Hindus, Muslims and everyone else.\u201d Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist agenda was seen as a powerful tool for him to win votes in the Hindi heartland. Yet many in Uttar Pradesh spoke of their disgust at the prime minister\u2019s seemingly increasingly anti-Muslim rhetoric out on the campaign trail. Purvi, who uses a single name, a 35-year-old teacher from the Uttar Pradesh region of Azamgarh, said she had voted for Modi in the last election, swayed by his image as a strongman leader. This time, she voted for the Samajwadi party, accusing Modi of \u201cpolarising the nation\u201d. \u201cEvery day, my Muslim friends feel intimidated by the hate that Modi and his party associates propagate,\u201d said Purvi. \u201cHow can I vote for the party whose leaders call Muslims infiltrators, terrorists, those who breed more? We have never seen a government so dangerous for the foundation of this nation and particularly for its minorities.\u201d Even in the prime minister\u2019s constituency of the holy city of Varanasi, also in Uttar Pradesh, Modi\u2019s sheen appeared to have faded, and his victory margin went from almost half a million votes in 2019 to 150,000 on Tuesday. The disenchantment was summed up by Sushmita Singh, 54, a government employee who voted for Modi in the past two elections, believing he would bring prosperity. This time round, she voted for Congress, India\u2019s largest opposition party also part of the INDIA coalition, angry at the animosity she felt was being stirred up between Hindus and Muslims and the government\u2019s failure to create good jobs for the growing youth population. \u201cPeople affiliated with the BJP get VIP treatment in Varanasi, while ordinary people suffer and are mistreated,\u201d said Singh. \u201cThe BJP is increasing its influence and behaving like colonial rulers.\u201d She added: \u201cIf a place like Varanasi, where the prime minister himself gets elected for the parliament, has not developed much in the last 10 years, then there is not much reason for me to believe Modi\u2019s promise of the development of our country.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-07T14:48:45Z",
            "content": "Time to wrap up\u2026 The US economy added 272,000 jobs in May, a sign the labor market continued strong amid high interest rates, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced on Friday. The number of May jobs was far higher than the 190,000 economists had expected and topped April\u2019s gains, when a revised 165,000 jobs were added to the economy. The report offered a mixed view of the jobs market. The unemployment rate rose to 4% for the first time since January 2022, up from 3.9% in April. The White House celebrated the news, which comes amid enduring public skepticism about the economy. \u201cThe great American comeback continues, but we still have to make more progress,\u201d Joe Biden said in a statement. \u201cOn my watch, 15.6 million more Americans have the dignity and respect that comes with a job.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: Goodnight, and have a good weekend. GW The US dollar is pushing higher against sterling, knocking the pound down by almost three-quarters of a cent to $1.2722. The White House council of economic advisors has published a thread on X, pulling out the key points from today\u2019s jobs report: Today\u2019s \u201cvery strong jobs report\u201d has cast further doubt on the prospect of US interest rate cuts this year, reports James Knightley, chief international economist at ING: He explains: US May non-farm payrolls came in at 272k versus the 180k consensus and higher than any of the 77 forecasts submitted to Bloomberg \u2013 the range was 120-258k. Private payrolls rose 229k versus the 165k consensus expectation. There were 15k of downward revisions to the past 2 months for headline payrolls, but this is still an undeniably strong set of numbers that has seen market interest rate cut expectations reduce significantly. The gains were once again led by the usual suspects of private education &amp; health services (+86k), leisure &amp; hospitality (+42k) and government (43k). Average hourly earnings rose 0.4%MoM/4.1%YoY versus 0.2/3.9% in April and also hotter than expected. This jump likely received a boost from recent minimum wage increases in California. The White House has issued a statement on the May Jobs Report, highlighting job creation under the current administration. In it, President Joe Biden says: The great American comeback continues, but we still have to make more progress. On my watch, 15.6 million more Americans have the dignity and respect that comes with a job. Unemployment has been at or below 4% for 30 months\u2014the longest stretch in 50 years. And a record high share of working-age women have jobs. I will keep fighting to lower costs for families like the ones I grew up with in Scranton. I\u2019m fighting corporate greed by calling on corporations with record profits to lower prices\u2014as Target and Walmart have for grocery prices. I\u2019m fighting to make rent more affordable by building 2 million new homes. I\u2019m fighting to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs, like insulin and inhalers. Congressional Republicans have a different vision\u2014one that puts billionaires and special interests first. The Republican plan would increase inflation by repealing the Affordable Care Act, siding with Big Oil to raise utility bills, letting Big Banks rip off Americans, and blow up the debt by slashing taxes for billionaires. I will never stop fighting for Scranton\u2014not Park Avenue. There\u2019s a possibility that the US Federal Reserve may not be able to cut interest rates at all this year, suggests Janet Mui, head of market analysis at wealth manager RBC Brewin Dolphin. At the end of 2023, investors expected a flurry of rate cuts in 2024, but inflation has remained subbornly high while economic growth has also held up pretty well. Mui says: All in all, today\u2019s bumper jobs number and sticky wage growth still skew toward the Fed keeping a tight policy stance. It will not give the Federal Reserve the confidence it needs to cut rates anytime soon. Markets are still pricing in at least one rate cut by the end of the year but there is a real possibility of no cut at all this year. All eyes are on the Fed\u2019s economic projections, including its expectations for the path of the Fed funds rate next week.\u201d Wall Street has opened in the red, as today\u2019s strong US jobs report dampens hope of an early interest rate cut. The news that US payrolls swelled by a greater-than-forecast 272,000 in May, while average earnings rose by 0.4% in the month, is weighing on stocks. At the start of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 large US companies lost 74 points, or 0.2%, to reach 38,811.99 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has dropped by 0.3%, while the technology-focused Nasdaq is down 0.35%. David Goebel, investment strategist at wealth manager Evelyn Partners, says: \u201cThis report caps off a mixed bag of a labour market signals this week that does little to make the Federal Reserve\u2019s job easier. \u201cThe headline non-farms number is a big upside surprise on the estimate, indicating a very healthy level of job creation. These gains were also broad-based, with the diffusion index, which measures the breadth of gains across industries, jumping to 63.4% in May from 56.6% in April. \u201cStronger than expected wage gains also contributed to the prevailing sticky inflation story. \u201cAt the same time, the unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.0%, its highest since January 2022. This looks to be a function of decreasing household employment, which fell 408k, because the participation rate took a dip to 62.5%, which would have exerted downward pressure on unemployment. Today\u2019s US jobs report is \u201ca genuine surprise\u201d compared with market expectations, says Daniele Antonucci, chief investment officer at Quintet Private Bank. Antonucci adds: Payrolls exceeded the highest predictions in the major forecasters\u2019 polls, the unemployment rate held steady rather than rising, and wage growth was stronger than consensus both on a month-on-month and year-on-year basis. The latest figures don\u2019t show any degree of softening, which was the baseline market scenario. Taken at face value, they represent a hurdle to the view that the labour market is cooling off. In turn, the implication is that the jobs picture is currently standing in the way of a Fed rate cut or two later this year. To be clear, one number doesn\u2019t make a trend and, on balance, the higher rates stay elevated for longer, the more likely it is economic growth and inflation will slow. What little hope there was of a US rate cut in July (and there was never much) has been squashed by today\u2019s jobs report. With job creation accelerating to 272,000 last month, and earnings growth rising too, Fed rate cut hopes have been doused. Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, explains: \u201cOne step forward, two steps back. Today\u2019s data undermines the message that other recent economic data have been giving of a cooling U.S. economy, and slams the door shut on a July rate cut. Not only has jobs growth exploded again, but wage growth has also surprised to the upside \u2013 both moving in the opposite direction to what the Fed needs to begin easing policy. We still expect the Fed to cut rates in September but another set of prints like today\u2019s would likely also take that off the table. The positive news, however, is that with a labor market this strong, the US economy is nowhere near recession territory.\u201d The Household Survey, released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics today, shows there were 6.6m unemployed people in America last month. That lifted the unemployment rate to 4.0% A year earlier, the jobless rate was 3.7%, and the number of unemployed people was 6.1m. The bigger-than-expected 272,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in May will soothe recent fears that the bottom had suddenly dropped out of the economy, say Capital Economics. They add: With average hourly earnings increasing by 0.4% m/m last month, the Fed will remain focused on the upside risks to inflation rather than the downside risks to the real economy. Today\u2019s US jobs report is \u201csomething of a mixed bag\u201d, says Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone. A blowout +272k headline nonfarm payrolls print beating all forecasts is being somewhat overshadowed by a net -15k revision to the prior two months of data, in addition to a surprising rise in unemployment to 4.0%, the highest since January 2022. Despite this, the report overall contained a hawkish bias, with hiring continuing apace, and earnings also growing at a hotter-than-expected 0.4% MoM, and 4.1% YoY, indicating that the labour market at large remains relatively tight. Unsurprisingly, the market reaction has been an aggressively hawkish one, with Treasuries and equities both slumping, as the dollar rallies to fresh day highs. Average earnings paid to US workers rose at a faster pace than expected last month, today\u2019s jobs report shows. That\u2019s a boost to employees but a headache for the Federal Reserve. Average hourly earnings rose by 4.1% year-on-year in May, and by 0.4% in the month alone. That also makes an early interest rate cut less likely, as solid wage growth will support inflation. The US dollar is rallying, as investors conclude that today\u2019s strong jobs report makes an early cut to US interest rates less likely. The greenback has gained half a cent against the pound, pushing sterling down to $1.2738. Here\u2019s a breakdown on where the US economy added jobs last month, from the Bureau for Labour Statistics: Health care added 68,000 jobs in May, in line with the average monthly gain of 64,000 over the prior 12 months. In May, employment growth continued in ambulatory health care services (+43,000), hospitals (+15,000), and nursing and residential care facilities (+11,000). Government employment continued to trend up in May (+43,000), in line with the average monthly growth over the prior 12 months (+52,000). Employment in leisure and hospitality continued to trend up in May (+42,000), similar to the average monthly gain over the prior 12 months (+35,000). Employment in food services and drinking places continued to trend up over the month (+25,000). Professional, scientific, and technical services added 32,000 jobs in May, higher than the average monthly gain of 19,000 over the prior 12 months. Over the month, employment increased in management, scientific, and technical consulting services (+14,000) and in architectural, engineering, and related services (+10,000). Specialized design services lost 3,000 jobs. Social assistance employment continued to trend up in May (+15,000), primarily in individual and family services (+11,000). Over the prior 12 months, social assistance had added an average of 22,000 jobs per month. In May, employment in retail trade continued to trend up (+13,000), about in line with the average monthly gain over the prior 12 months (+8,000). Building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers added 12,000 jobs in May, while job losses occurred in department stores (-5,000) and furniture and home furnishings retailers (-4,000). The jobs reports that there was little or no change in other major industries, including mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction; construction; manufacturing; wholesale trade; transportation and warehousing; information; financial activities; and other services. Newsflash: The US economy added 272,000 jobs in May, much more than expected. That\u2019s a rather stronger report than economists had expected \u2013 with Wall Street having forecast an increase of around 185,000 jobs. The latest non-farm payroll report shows that employment continued to trend up in health care; government; leisure and hospitality; and professional, scientific, and technical services. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics also reports that the US unemployment rate rose to 4% in May, from 3.9% in April. That\u2019s the highest rate since January 2022. March and April\u2019s jobs reports have been revised a little lower too. The BLS says: The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for March was revised down by 5,000, from +315,000 to +310,000, and the change for April was revised down by 10,000, from +175,000 to +165,000. Financial markets would probably be happiest with a jobs report which showed a small slowdown in hiring \u2013 to encourage interest rate cuts \u2013 but not large enough to suggest the US economy is in trouble. As Danish bank Saxo put it: If headline jobs growth comes in softer than expected, markets may try to bring forward Fed rate cut expectations, and that can fuel risk-on sending stocks higher and the US dollar lower as long as growth concerns do not over-rule the rate cut narrative. Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict the jobs report will come in below expectations. They told clients: We estimate nonfarm payrolls rose by 160k in May, somewhat below consensus of +185k. When the labor market is tight, job growth tends to slow disproportionately during the spring hiring season and particularly in May\u2014when the seasonal factors expect more hiring than is realistic with fewer workers available\u2014and all five of the alternative measures of employment growth we track suggest a below-consensus report. On the positive side, we expect a tailwind from the longer-than-usual May payroll month. While the seasonal factors in principle adjust for these effects, it appears they may have been distorted by a weak payrolls reading in May 2019, which was also 5 weeks long. A strong US jobs report today could rock the markets, warns Achilleas Georgolopoulos, investment analyst at XM: The stock markets could go into a tailspin if there is a significant upside surprise today. For example, a 250k+ print in the non-farm payroll figures could push the S&amp;P 500 index decisively lower and help the 10-year US Treasury yield flirt with the 4.5% level again. The Fed does not like acute market reactions and remains fearful of a repeat of the March 2023 bank failures. Excitement is building in the financial markets ahead of the latest US jobs report, due in just over half an hour. May\u2019s non-farm payroll will show how many jobs were created across the American economy last month. It will be released at 1.30pm UK time, or 8.30am EDT. That, and the latest wage data, will be a crucial factor in how soon the US Federal Reserve feels confidence to start cutting US interest rates. Economists predict the NFP will show around 185,000 new jobs were created in May, which would be a small increase on the 175,000 in April (although that number could be revised today). Wall Street also expects the unemployment rate to remain at 3.9% in May, while average monthly earnings growth could rise to 0.3%, from 0.2% in April. Henk Potts, market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, sets the scene\u2026 \u201cThe US economy continues to be resilient and its labour market remains in relatively rude health. Around 200,000 nonfarm payroll jobs are expected to have been created in May, compared with 175,000 registered in April, with the unemployment rate set to remain at 3.9%. We anticipate that we could see a further softening in labour market conditions, but expect that the unemployment rate will peak at just 4% in the coming months, which would still be low when compared to historical standards.\u201d In other UK supermarket news, Waitrose has snapped up restaurant meal kit brand Dishpatch, expanding its direct-to-consumer business. The finish-at-home meal kit business was founded in 2020 and offers customers meals designed by celebrity chefs including Angela Hartnett, Michel Roux Jr and Rick Stein. Waitrose \u2013 the grocery arm of the John Lewis Partnership \u2013 said it sees \u201csignificant opportunities\u201d for Dishpatch following the deal. Dishpatch customers can order food from more than 40 menus, with food and wine delivered on Fridays and dishes pre-prepared to be finished and served at home. Just in: Russia\u2019s central bank has left interest rates on hold, but threatened to raise them in coming months to fight inflation. The Bank of Russia has just announced it is maintaining interest rates at 16%. It warns that inflation in Russia has stopped falling, and that domestic demand for goods and services is rising faster than the economy\u2019s ability to meet it (which is inflationary). According to the estimate as of 3 June, annual inflation stood at 8.1% after 7.8% at the end of April, the Bank says. And it drops a clear signal that rates could be raised soon, saying: The Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of increasing the key rate at its upcoming meeting. Furthermore, returning inflation to the target will require a significantly longer period of maintaining tight monetary conditions in the economy than it was forecast in April. According to the Bank of Russia\u2019s forecast and given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will return to the target in 2025 and stabilise close to 4% further on. Germany\u2019s central bank has cut its growth forecasts, in another blow to Europe\u2019s largest economy. The Bundesbank now expects growth of just 0.3% in 2024, below the 0.4% forecast in December. For 2025, it now sees growth of 1.1%, weaker than the 1.2% forecast before. The Bundesbank says thee German economy is \u201cslowly regaining its footing after a roughly two-year period of weakness\u201d. As Bundesbank president Joachim Nagel puts it: The German economy is extricating itself from the period of economic weakness. Nagel adds that \u201cWe on the ECB Governing Council are not driving on auto-pilot when it comes to interest rate cuts.\u201d, a day after the first cut in eurozone interest rates in five years. Newsflash: the long-anticipated business break-up of the billionaire brothers Zuber and Mohsin Issa has been agreed. Zuber Issa has sold his 22.5% stake in Asda supermarket, which the brothers bought in a leveraged buyout in 2020, to fellow shareholder TDR Capital, the private equity firm. Thsi will take TDR Capital\u2019s total shareholding to 67.5%. Mohsin Issa will continue to own 22.5%, with Walmart owning the remaining 10% This follows report of a rift between the brothers, following the breakdown of Mohsin\u2019s marriage which is said to have \u201csent shockwaves\u201d through the family. And in another development, EG Group \u2013 the petrol station and convenience store chain founded by the brothers \u2013 has just announced the sale of its 'remaining UK forecourt business\u2019 to Zuber Issa for \u00a3228m. He is also stepping down as co-CEO of the business. Zuber Issa says: Since Mohsin and I, alongside TDR, took ownership of Asda, we have driven a period of significant investment and entrepreneurial growth activity. Notably, Asda acquired a market-leading UK convenience retail and foodservice store business from EG Group. With the divestment of my Asda shares, I will now turn my attention towards leading and managing the remaining EG UK forecourt sites that I have personally acquired, and spend more time on my charitable endeavours. There were reports back in February that such a deal was being explored. The takeover of Asda by the Issa brothers and TDR put billions of extra debt onto Asda\u2019s balance sheet. Today, the supermarket says: Asda\u2019s net debt at the end of Q124 was \u00a33.8bn, net of more than \u00a31bn cash on the balance sheet \u2013 and the business is fully committed to further deleveraging. We also have confirmation that the eurozone returned to growth in the last quarter, but didn\u2019t expand as fast as the UK. Data bosy Eurostat has reported that eurozone GDP rose by 0.3% in January-March, in line with its previous estimates, after a 0.1% fall in October-December. That\u2019s broadly in line with the US, which grew at an annualised rate of 1.3% in Q1 2024 (or just over 0.3% in the quarter). But the UK posted growth of 0.6%, as the economy exited recession. Global food commodity prices have risen again, in a blow to households worldwide. The United Nations world food price index rose for a third consecutive month in May, as falling prices for sugar and vegetable oil were counted by rising prices for cereal and dairy products. Prices rose by 0.9% in May compared with April. But, that still left the FAO Food Price Index (FFPI) 3.4% lower than a year ago, and nearly 25% below the peak of 160.2 points reached in March 2022, after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine drove up prices. Cereal prices jumped by 6.3% in March, which the UN attribues to \u201cgrowing concerns about unfavourable crop conditions for the 2024 harvests\u201d and \u201cdamage to the Black Sea shipping infrastructure\u201d. Dairy prices rose 1.8% in the month, due to \u201cincreased demand from the retail and food services sectors ahead of the summer holidays\u201d, and expectations that milk production may fall below historical levels in Western Europe. But sugar prices fell by 7.5%, due to a \u201cgood start\u201d of the new harvest season in Brazil, and \u201cconducive weather conditions\u201d boosting the global supply outlook. And vegetable oil prices dropped by 2.4%, driven by a fall in the cost of palm oil as outputs across major producing countries in Southeast Asia rose. These higher commodity costs will feed through to shoppers, and may slow the fall in food inflation. There could be a \u2018bounce\u2019 in house prices this autun, predicts Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, if interest rates start to fall. Bill says: \u201cHouse prices remain under pressure as an interest rate cut moves further over the horizon. Demand will typically rise in spring but there has been a 0.3% price decline over the last three months thanks to stubborn services inflation and rising swap rates. There should be a more noticeable bounce this autumn when the first rate cut since March 2020 is likely to have happened and the political backdrop will have stabilised. We expect UK prices to rise by 3% this year as the prospect of more mortgages starting with a \u20183\u2019 gets closer.\u201d We\u2019re not there yet, though! Here are the latest fixed-rate mortgage rates, just released by Moneyfacts: The average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.95%. This is unchanged from the previous working day. The average 5-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.52%. This is up from an average rate of 5.51% on the previous working day. The maker of Bulmers, Magners and Tennent\u2019s cider has announced the shock departure of its CEO after revealing it had overstated its profits in recent years by \u20ac5m. C&amp;C told the City that detailed internal and external reviews had discovered a series of mistakes in its accounts in recent years. This means it will take a \u20ac1m adjustment charge for the 2023 financial year, a \u20ac3m adjustment credit in FY2022 and a \u20ac7m adjustment charge in FY2021. And CEO Patrick McMahon is paying the price; he\u2019s leave his role, having stepped up from his position as finance chief a year ago. C&amp;C explains: The Group\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Patrick McMahon, was Chief Financial Officer during the periods to which these adjustments relate and acknowledges that the relevant shortcomings occurred at a time when he had overall responsibility for the Group\u2019s finance function. Accordingly, he has informed the Board that he will step down as CEO and as a director with immediate effect. C&amp;C also reported a loss of \u20ac111m for the last financial year, down from a profit of \u20ac52m a year before. Shares in C&amp;C are down 7% in early trading, the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 index. Bellway has also raised its forecast for the overall average selling price of its houses to around \u00a3305,000, up from previous guidance of \u00a3295,000. This is \u201cmainly due to changes in product mix\u201d, says Bellway \u2013 meaning it expects to sell more high-end, pricier, homes. UK housebuilder Bellway has issued an upbeat trading statement, saying it has seen \u201cstronger trading through the spring selling season\u201d. Bellway says \u201cimproved affordability\u201d is helping to lift customer confidence, leading to an increase in reservations for new houses and \u201cfirm\u201d prices. Bellway\u2019s private reservation rate per outlet has risen to 0.62 per week in the February-May quarter, a 6.9% increase on a year ago. Jason Honeyman, Bellway\u2019s CEO, says the company is on track to build around 7,500 homes this financial year, adding: We have been encouraged by ongoing healthy levels of customer interest and combined with the strength of our outlet opening programme, we continue to expect a year-on-year increase in the forward order book at 31 July 2024. As a result, Bellway remains in a strong position to return to growth in financial year 2025. The recent rise in mortgage rates is likely to prevent any meaningful pickup in transactions and prices in the short-term, predicts Peter Arnold, chief economist at EY UK. But Arnold also suggests we won\u2019t see a new downturn in prices either\u2026 saying: \u201cWhile 2023 was a challenging year for the housing market, data for the first half of 2024 has suggested that the market has passed the bottom. The substantial fall in mortgage rates since last summer, combined with strong growth in nominal wages, has reduced the scale of the mortgage affordability problem. This has helped to entice some buyers back to the market, leading to a recovery in transactions and putting a floor under prices. \u201cOver the past couple of months, mortgage rates have edged up again in response to rising swap rates, as financial markets anticipate a slower pace of Bank of England interest rate cuts. This is likely to prevent any meaningful pickup in transactions and prices in the near-term. But so far, the increases have been small and mortgage rates remain well below last summer\u2019s peaks. The EY ITEM Club does not expect to see a renewed downturn in the housing market. Building up a deposit to buy a house is a large hurdle for first-time buyers, especially those who can\u2019t turn to wealthy parents for help. But the Labour Party are pledging to help \u2013 last night, they annouced they would permanently sustain and expand the current mortgage guarantee scheme. The measure sees the government act as guarantor for part of a home loan \u2013 to encourage lenders to make low-deposit mortgages available for first-time buyers, Labour, whose offering is dubbed \u2018Freedom to Buy\u2019, says it will help over 80,000 young people to get on the housing ladder over the next five years. Labour leader Keir Starmer says: \u201cAfter 14 years of Conservative government, the dream of home ownership is out of reach for too many hard working people. Despite doing everything right, they can\u2019t move on and up. A generation face becoming renters for life. \u201cMy parents\u2019 home gave them security and was a foundation for our family. As Prime Minister, I will turn the dream of owning a home into a reality. \u201cOur changed Labour Party will be on the side of the builders not the blockers, to get Britain building again. My Labour Government will help first-time buyers onto the ladder with a new Freedom to Buy scheme for those without a large deposit, and by giving them first dibs on new developments. Labour are also pledging planning reform to build 1.5 million homes, saying this is the best way in the long term. They say: We will reintroduce housing targets, build on disused grey belt land, fast track permissions on brownfield and build the next generation of new towns. Over the last quarter, average UK house prices were 0.3% lower than in the previous three months, Halifax reports. This chart shows the monthly changes we\u2019ve seen this year: After jumping 1.2% in January, they grew 0.3% in February, before dropping 0.9% in March, stagnating in April and then dipping 0.1% in May. House prices rose fastest in the North West of England in May \u2013 they were up 3.8% on an annual basis in May, taking the average price to \u00a3232,258. In Northern Ireland, prices rose by 3.2%, while in Scotland they were 1.9% higher than a year ago. In Wales, house prices grew annually by +0.7% \u2013 below the UK average of 1.5%. Prices fell fastest in Eastern England, where they dropped by 0.8% in the year to May. In London, prices have risen by 0.2% over the last year, to an average of \u00a3536,821 \u2013 still the most expensive part of the UK. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Stability has returned to the UK housing market, the latest data from lender Halifax shows, with prices dipping slightly last month. Halifax\u2019s latest house price index, just released, shows that average prices were little changed month-on-month in May, The average house prices slipped to \u00a3288,688 last month, a 0.1% drop compared to \u00a3288,862 in April. But on an annual basis, house price inflation rose to +1.5% in May, up from +1.1% in April. Rising wages and a pick-up in economic confidence are supporting house prices, says Amanda Bryden, head of mortgages at Halifax. Bryden explains: This has been reflected in a broadly stable picture in terms of property price movements, with the average cost of a property little changed over the last three months. Bryden adds that a period of relative stability in both house prices and interest rates should lift confidence for both buyers and sellers. While homebuyers and those remortgaging will continue to respond to changes in borrowing costs, set against a backdrop of a limited supply of available properties, the market is unlikely to see huge fluctuations in the near term. Last week, rival lender Nationwide reported a rise in prices last month. It\u2019s important to remember, though, that both Halifax and Nationwide\u2019s data is based on mortgage transactions, so doesn\u2019t capture cash buyers. Also coming up today UK entrepreneur Mike Lynch will be celebrating after being cleared of all charges by a US jury in a fraud case related to the sale of his software company Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard (HP) in 2011. Investors are poised for the latest US jobs report, which is expected to show the unemployment rate stuck at 3.9% in May.

The Reform UK leader, who has been criticised for suggesting the west provoked Russian aggression against Ukraine, said it was time for the Ukrainian president to rethink his goal of reclaiming all territory lost to Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion, as such a mission was going to be \u201cincredibly difficult\u201d. Farage made his latest remarks on the Ukraine war while speaking to journalists from the Times and the Daily Mail on a trip to the Channel to highlight the number of small boat crossings. It came after another Reform UK politician, Julian Malins, the candidate for Salisbury, was booed for telling local voters that Putin \u201cseemed very good\u201d. Malins had been asked whether Reform UK would continue to support Ukraine, as Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson have done, with the latter maintaining a relationship with Zelenskiy even after being forced out of No 10. \u201cWar is not about, as it were, punishing or in some way running over thousands of young men in tanks and blowing them up because one person takes points of view which you disagree with,\u201d Malins told a hustings in Salisbury on Sunday. \u201cI have actually met Putin and had a 10-minute chat with him and he seemed very good. He is not the Austrian gentleman with a moustache come alive again.\u201d The constituency Malin hopes to represent is where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned with novichok. Skripal and his daughter survived the attack but at the end of June 2018 a Wiltshire woman, Dawn Sturgess, and her partner, Charlie Rowley, were poisoned in Amesbury, eight miles north of Salisbury. Sturgess, 44, died on 8 July that year. While Farage has stressed he dislikes Putin and opposes the invasion of Ukraine, he has been criticised for expressing a narrative seen as supportive of the Russian president. He has also criticised Johnson for rejecting the prospect of a peace deal. Speaking at a rally in Devon on Tuesday, Farage said: \u201cSomehow, I am made out to be a Putin apologist, which of course I\u2019m not. What he\u2019s done in Ukraine is reprehensible. \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s Daily Mail, who have decided that I am one of the worst people that\u2019s ever been born, not for the first time, just because I got up over 10 years ago and said that I felt the eastward expansion of Nato and the European Union would be used by a dangerous dictator as a reason to go to war. \u201cIn Ukraine, I said, don\u2019t poke the Russian bear with a stick because if you do you will get a very predictable result.\u201d"

            "content": "Volodomyr Zelenskiy has accused China of discouraging other countries from attending a peace summit in Switzerland later this month that is aimed at bringing peace to war-ravaged Ukraine. Speaking at Asia\u2019s biggest security conference, the Shangri-La Dialogue, in Singapore, the Ukrainian president sought to rally support among Asia-Pacific nations, urging them to attend the Swiss meeting. \u201cThe world has to be resilient, it needs to be strong, it has to pressure Russia,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cThere is no other way to stop Putin \u2013 only diplomatic isolation, a strong Ukrainian military and for all the countries of the world to not balance between Ukraine and Russia but to defend international justice and law.\u201d Zelenskiy said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d some world leaders had not yet confirmed attendance. Russia was seeking to undermine the summit by warning countries not to attend and threatening a blockade of agricultural goods and food products, he said. He later told media that China had supported such efforts to deter leaders from participating. \u201cRegrettably, Russia, using Chinese influence on the region, using Chinese diplomats also, does everything to disrupt the peace summit. It is unfortunate that such a big, independent, powerful country as China is an instrument in the hands of Putin,\u201d he said. Since a phone call between Zelenskiy and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, one year ago, Ukraine had sought meetings with Chinese officials at all levels, he said, but this had not been granted. He had not met Chinese officials despite their presence in Singapore. Earlier on Sunday, the Chinese defence minister, Dong Jun, told attendees of the Shangri-La Dialogue his country had \u201cbeen promoting peace talks with a responsible attitude\u201d. \u201cWe have never provided weapons to either party of the conflict. We have put stricter control on the export of dual use items and have never done anything to fan the flames. We stand firmly on the side of peace and dialogue,\u201d Dong said. But Zelenskiy said: \u201cWith China\u2019s support to Russia, the war will last longer and that is bad for the whole world. You cannot say that we accept sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and at the same time be on the side of the country that violates the principles of the UN charter and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u201d Zelenskiy said on X he had met the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue on Sunday morning. \u201cWe discussed the key issues: the defence needs of our country, bolstering Ukraine\u2019s air defence system, the F-16 coalition, and drafting of a bilateral security agreement,\u201d he said. He said he was grateful to Joe Biden for his decision to allow Ukraine to use US-supplied weapons against targets in Russia. However, in comments to media he said that this was not enough as Ukraine still did not have the systems or permissions to target airfields from which Russia was \u201cpermanently firing\u201d."

            "content": "Key regional powers including Brazil, India, South Africa and Saudi Arabia have failed to sign up to a joint communique issued at the end of a Ukraine peace conference in which more than 80 countries and international organisations endorsed its territorial integrity in the face of Russia\u2019s invasion. Speaking at the end of the two-day summit in Switzerland, Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, welcomed the \u201cfirst steps toward peace\u201d but acknowledged that not all attenders had come onboard. \u201cUnfortunately there are people who are still balancing,\u201d he said, adding that Russia was trying to divide the world. He said the final communique remained \u201copen for accession by everyone who respects the UN charter\u201d. About 100 countries took part in the conference in the resort of B\u00fcrgenstock, but Russia was not invited and China snubbed the event. Amid modest expectations ahead of the event, western diplomats argued that its significance lay partly in its participants. Attenders were mostly from Europe, the US and other western allies, but included countries from Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Zelenskiy said parties had agreed to work in special groups on \u201caction plans for peace\u201d, which he said would open the way to a second peace summit. The final text was signed by more than 80 countries and international organisations, including the three main EU institutions and 27 EU member states. It said the UN charter, the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all states \u201ccan and will serve as a basis in achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine\u201d. In a boost for Kyiv, Turkey, which maintains close trading links with Russia and has sought to be a peacemaker, signed the document. It was also signed by Argentina, Iraq, Qatar and Rwanda. Saudi Arabia, India, South Africa, Thailand, Indonesia, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates, however, took part in the summit, but did not sign the final communique. Brazil attended with \u201cobserver status\u201d and did not endorse the text. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said it would take time to achieve peace in Ukraine. \u201c[The Swiss summit] was not a peace negotiation because Putin is not serious about ending the war, he\u2019s insisting on capitulation, he\u2019s insisting on ceding Ukrainian territory \u2013 even territory that today is not occupied.\u201d Before the gathering, Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, demanded that Ukrainian troops leave four eastern Ukrainian regions that are partially occupied by his troops. In another diplomatic non-starter for Kyiv, Putin also called on Ukraine to abandon plans to join Nato. China decided not to send an envoy to the summit, despite Ukraine\u2019s invitation. Asked about Beijing\u2019s position on the war, Zelenskiy said: \u201cChina is a very serious, serious state, [and] serious economy that has political and economic influence on Russia. China truly has influence and I believe that China could help us.\u201d He added: \u201cI believe that friends are those who are helping when it is difficult. I would want China to be a friend for Ukraine.\u201d Signatories to the communique stated that threats or use of nuclear weapons was \u201cinadmissible\u201d, after repeated nuclear sabre-rattling by Putin, as well as attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear energy plant, which was captured by Russia early in the war and sits on the frontline. It called for attacks to cease on Ukrainian civilian ports and on merchant ships, saying food security \u201cmust not be weaponised in any way\u201d. And it called for the release of all prisoners of war and the return of unlawfully detained Ukrainian civilians, including children. In line with the summit\u2019s modest aims, there was no discussion of what a postwar settlement would look like or Ukraine\u2019s hopes of joining Nato. Viola Amherd, the Swiss president, who hosted the event, said the fact that the \u201cgreat majority\u201d of participants agreed to the final document \u201cshows what diplomacy can achieve\u201d. Speaking to reporters, Zelenskiy suggested the military situation had \u201cstabilised\u201d in Kharkiv, the north-eastern region subject to fierce bombardment from advancing Russian forces. \u201cOur task for today is not to give Russia successes in their offensive operations in Kharkiv,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cThe situation is better, it has stabilised and I believe that in the near future, thanks to our partners there will be strengthening of our warriors.\u201d Asked whether western military aid was sufficient, Zelenskiy said: \u201cThere is aid. There are serious packages. Is it enough to win? No. Is it late? Yes. Will there be strengthening of these packages? We are working on this. We are working on a daily basis.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-03T18:54:32Z",
            "content": "The White House insisted that the \u201cball was in Hamas\u2019s court\u201d on whether to accept a new Gaza peace proposal, despite mixed signals from Benjamin Netanyahu reflecting turmoil within his governing coalition in Israel. The US national security spokesperson, John Kirby, insisted on Monday that it was an Israeli proposal \u2013 despite the fact it had been unveiled by Joe Biden on Friday, during the Jewish Sabbath, and Netanyahu had appeared to challenge it. The Israeli prime minister said any deal that did not lead to the complete destruction of Hamas\u2019s military and governing capacity would be a \u201cnon-starter\u201d. The Israeli prime minister told the Knesset on Monday: \u201cThe claims that we have agreed to a ceasefire without our conditions being met are incorrect.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard different statements coming out of Israel,\u201d Kirby said, pointing out that the country\u2019s foreign minister, Israel Katz, had acknowledged that it was an Israeli proposal. The three-phase plan outlined by Biden on Friday, he added, \u201caccurately reflects that proposal that we worked with the Israelis on\u201d. \u201cHamas has now got this proposal. It got it Thursday night. We\u2019re awaiting an official response by them,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cThey ought to take the deal. This gives them what they\u2019ve been looking for, which is a ceasefire and over time, through phases, the potential withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.\u201d \u201cIt is fair to say that the ball is in Hamas\u2019s court,\u201d he said. US officials said that the proposal had evolved in discussions between US, Israeli and Qatari negotiators in the past few weeks. However, Netanyahu was given just a few hours\u2019 notice on Friday that Biden would make it public. The officials said that the timing, with Biden speaking when Israeli government offices were closed for the Sabbath and the country\u2019s most conservative, religiously observant politicians had cut themselves off from the internet and other communications, was not deliberate, but was dictated by the fact that the four and a half page plan was delivered to Hamas on Thursday. It was transmitted to the Hamas political leadership based in Qatar but officials said it could take time for it to be conveyed to Yahya Sinwar, the group\u2019s leader in Gaza, and for a reply to come back from him. The first phase of the proposal would be similar to an earlier plan that failed to win agreement. Over six weeks, Hamas would release elderly, sick, wounded and female hostages, and Israel would free a greater number of Palestinian detainees. There would be a ceasefire and Israeli forces would pull back from densely populated areas, allowing Palestinians to go back to whatever is left of their homes, and 600 trucks of humanitarian assistance would cross into the coastal strip each day. At the same time there would be negotiations on how to reach a second, more comprehensive, phase, which would involve the release of all remaining hostages and the freeing of more Palestinian prisoners, a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops and a permanent cessation of hostilities. A third phase would address reconstruction and governance in Gaza. One of the innovations of the new proposal is a clause saying the initial six-week ceasefire would extend as long as negotiations for a second phase continued, so there would not be a looming deadline that would trigger a return to combat. It is in the transition between the first and second phase where the gaps between Biden and Netanyahu\u2019s versions are the greatest. The plan, as spelled out by the US president, suggested that Hamas and Israel would negotiate the second phase, but the Israeli prime minister insisted that Hamas would have to be smashed before there could be an enduring ceasefire. Biden said that Hamas was no longer in a position to launch another attack like its 7 October attack on southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people and triggered the current Gaza war, implying that Israel had achieved its military objections, but Netanyahu suggested to the obliteration of the extremist group had to be more extensive and final. A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, said on Monday evening that the military would be able to ensure Israel\u2019s security in any Gaza truce and hostage release deal decided on by the government. The IDF also said that four more of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas have died in captivity and their bodies are being held by the Islamist group. The four dead hostages were named as Haim Perry, Yoram Metzger, Amiram Cooper and Nadav Popplewell, all of whom had appeared alive in hostage videos posted earlier by Hamas. About 120 hostages are still unaccounted for, of whom 40 are thought to have died in the course of the war. Netanyahu told his cabinet on Monday that Israel\u2019s first priority in Gaza is to destroy Hamas, and the first stage of the plan announced by Biden on Friday could be implemented on its own without agreeing to an end to the war. \u201cThis is not something that I am adding now. This is not something that I am adding because I am under pressure within the coalition. It is something we agreed on unanimously in the war cabinet,\u201d Netanyahu said in a video statement. US officials admitted that part of the reason Biden unveiled the peace proposal was to lock in the Israeli war cabinet to acknowledge its terms and its ownership of the plan, conscious that Netanyahu was reluctant to go public with something that could wreck his government. Since Friday, Netanyahu has come under intense pressure from the rightwing of his government. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, accused the prime minister of trying to whitewash the peace deal, and restated his threat to quit the government if Israel entered a deal that did not specify the total destruction of Hamas as a military and political force. The finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has also threatened to resign over the deal, arguing Israel\u2019s only option was to increase military pressure on Hamas. \u201cThe dangerous proposal that President Biden spoke of was made by the war cabinet without authority and against the law, and it is not binding for the government of Israel and state of Israel,\u201d Smotrich said. Israel\u2019s Kan Radio reported that the prime minister had \u201cpromised his political partners that the war would not end and said that he believed that the chances of reaching a deal were very low\u201d."

            "title": "Ukraine reconstruction agency chief quits day before recovery conference",
            "date": "2024-06-10T12:14:34Z",
            "content": "The head of Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction agency has resigned a day before an international conference on the country\u2019s long-term reconstruction, saying he had been prevented from attending after being systematically undermined by the Ukrainian government from doing his job. Mustafa Nayyem announced his resignation in a Facebook post on Monday after previously sending a strongly worded message to a number of foreign partners criticising the Ukrainian administration for a wide range of mistakes. Nayyem said the final straw was when his permission to travel to Berlin was revoked. The two-day Ukraine recovery conference starts in Berlin on Tuesday and is due to be addressed by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The German government has described it as sending an important signal to Ukrainians about the long-term future of their country. Critics have called for a refocusing to increase Ukraine\u2019s current resilience, by for instance preventing prolonged energy blackouts this winter. The conference will include the launch of 95 investment projects for which it is hoped western funding will be secured, as well as a range of reform targets. The country\u2019s future accession to the EU will also be discussed, in what organisers have referred to as a \u201cfourth dimension\u201d of the conference agenda. Hosted by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, attendees are to include a range of senior international diplomats and foreign ministers, from Dmytro Kuleba of Ukraine to the UK\u2019s David Cameron. Several Ukrainian mayors from big cities including Kyiv and Lviv are expected to attend. In Nayyem\u2019s letter, obtained by the Guardian, and in his posting to Facebook, he was deeply critical of the style of governance around Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction while stopping short of criticising Zelenskiy directly. He said effectively his job, which he described as \u201cthe most challenging work of my life\u201d, was made impossible to carry out. Included in a long list of complaints, Nayyem expressed regret at: The lack of \u201cgovernment approval for the payment of $150m (\u00a3118m) borrowed from the European Investment Bank for critical projects including water supply and energy protection\u201d. Being \u201cplagued by inexplicable bureaucratic delays\u201d. A \u201csignificant reduction in salaries\u201d at his agency (a senior expert now earns the equivalent of \u20ac320 [\u00a3270] a month) leading to a loss of a quarter of staff since January. Nayyem said the \u201cpersistent opposition, resistance and the creation of artificial barriers\u201d his agency had faced had \u201crendered it impossible to effectively fulfil my duties\u201d. The delays and hold-ups had resulted in \u201closs of trust from the market, local authorities and citizens\u201d, he said. While admitting \u201cmistakes and shortcomings\u201d that he said were \u201cinevitable in implementing projects of such complexity and under such conditions\u201d, he said the agency had delivered a wide range of valuable successes, was now coordinating work on 353 construction sites across the country and had restored nearly 1,300km of roads and 330 bridges damaged in the conflict as well as building 155km of main water pipeline in the Dnipropetrovsk region, after the Russian military destroyed the Kakhovka dam. Nayyem\u2019s resignation follows the dismissal last month of the minister of infrastructure, Oleksandr Kubrakov, under whom he was appointed, and with whom he said he had worked closely. In recent months, Ukraine\u2019s foreign allies have become increasingly concerned over what they describe as centralising tendencies in Zelenskiy\u2019s administration. Kubrakov\u2019s firing has added to those concerns. Kubrakov was widely respected by international partners. One diplomatic source in Kyiv described his firing just before the Berlin conference as \u201ca bit of a disaster, image-wise\u201d. This will be compounded by Nayyem resigning on the eve of the conference. Nayyem said in his letter that Kubrakov\u2019s dismissal had made the work impossible, and \u201cthe government\u2019s recent decision to cancel my official participation in the Ukraine recovery conference in Berlin confirmed this\u201d, he added. As western diplomats expressed concerns over the dismissal of Kubrakov, not least the embarrassment of the conference taking place without him, Josh Rudolph, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund thinktank, said Kubrakov\u2019s dismissal was regrettable, as he had been regarded as an innovator in fighting corruption and building transparency. \u201cCentral power has come to wipe out the team that was building a transparent system of national restoration and replaces it with loyalists,\u201d he said. Nayyem, who was born in Afghanistan but moved to Ukraine as a child, became one of the country\u2019s leading journalists. In November 2013, he called for street protests against a decision by the government of Viktor Yanukovych to back out of a trade agreement with the EU under Russian pressure. The protests eventually became the Maidan revolution that toppled Yanukovych and his government. After the revolution, Nayyem became an MP. In 2021, he was appointed deputy minister of infrastructure, and in early 2023 was made head of Ukraine\u2019s state agency for reconstruction, tasked with dealing with the destruction wrought by the Russian invasion even as it continued. The job involved \u201cplanning with short-term horizons\u201d, Nayyem told the Guardian last year, as it was never clear what Russia could strike next. But it also involved drawing up longer-term plans for when the war ends."

            "content": "Russian damage to Ukraine\u2019s power grid has led to calls for a recovery conference starting in Berlin on Tuesday to pivot away from long-term reconstruction and focus on preventing prolonged energy blackouts this winter. Lengthy summer power cuts, as well as domestic price increases, are already afflicting Ukraine, with state agencies forced to cut energy use, adding urgency to the calls to boost air defences. The conference, due to be addressed by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will include the unveiling of 95 investment projects needing western funds as well as a mass of progress reports against more than 200 reform targets set by the EU and multilateral banks. Ukrainian NGOs have been expressing fear that a two-day discussion about a plan for reconstruction after a currently theoretical Russian military defeat may seem irrelevant to the immediate need of boosting resilience. In one of the many calls for the conference to focus on immediate crises, Mattia Nelles, the chief executive of the German-Ukrainian Bureau, said: \u201cStop talking about abstract long-term recovery. Let\u2019s focus on not just providing Ukraine with sufficient weapons and ammunition but also helping focus on energy resilience. With well over 50% of the country\u2019s energy production destroyed, the situation looks increasingly dire.\u201d Speaking on Friday, Ukraine\u2019s deputy finance minister Olga Zykova said Russia\u2019s terror attacks on Ukraine\u2019s power grid had destroyed 8 gigawatts of capacity, forcing a fall in the GDP forecast from 4.6% to 3.5%. Restoration was a top priority. She added it was now certain that the war would not be over in 2024. Geoffrey Pyatt, the head of the G7+ energy coordinating group, said Ukraine\u2019s energy system was in \u201can extremely fragile state\u201d as a result of Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. Top officials from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development visited Kyiv this week to sign a plan to offer \u20ac300m (\u00a3250m) of new funding for Ukraine\u2019s state-owned energy sector companies and to explore further support for the energy sector. At the weekend the US president, Joe Biden, announced a $225m (\u00a3180m) package of extra air defence interceptors in an attempt to slow the damage. This is on top of the money distributed to the multinational energy support fund which has been so far reliant on grants from Germany, the EU, Sweden and the UK. Western diplomats have expressed concerns at the dismissal a month ago of the deputy prime minister for restoration, Oleksandr Kubrakov, and a plan to split his ministry in half. Josh Rudolph, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund thinktank, said Kubrakov and his team had been regarded as innovators in fighting corruption and building transparency. He said: \u201cCentral power has come to wipe out the team that was building a transparent system of national restoration and replaces it with loyalists.\u201d Kubrakov had set up internet-based forms of transparency. One analyst said: \u201cThe words reconstruction and recovery are like a lightning rod, in fact recovery has become a toxic word. Ukrainians are sick and tired of the international conference about recovery. They say they don\u2019t need a recovery conference. We want to prevent recovery from being needed, and that requires a harder edge about resilience, weapons and energy.\u201d Last year\u2019s event, held in London in the optimistic context of an imminent Ukrainian offensive, focused on building private sector involvement in Ukraine\u2019s economic recovery. Berlin has been planning for the conference for months and has set out four broad themes including mobilising the private sector for reconstruction and economic growth, social capital and human capital for the future of Ukraine, recovery of municipalities and regions, and finally the necessary internal reforms to meet EU accession criteria, including revamping the supreme court to root out corruption."

            "title": "UK economy flatlines in blow to Rishi Sunak\u2019s hopes of recovery",
            "date": "2024-06-12T08:18:09Z",
            "content": "The UK economy flatlined in April, held back by wet weather, as the signs of a recovery from last year\u2019s recession began to fade. In a blow to Rishi Sunak\u2019s hopes of signalling a strong bounceback before the general election on 4 July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said monthly growth stalled after a 0.4% increase in March. The economy was unable to maintain its momentum after being weighed down by the struggling retail sector, a downturn in manufacturing and a drop in construction output. The 0.0% growth figure matched the forecast by City economists, who blamed the month\u2019s heavy rains for difficulties faced by workers on building sites and the lack of shoppers on the high street. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the underlying weakness of the economy was revealed by figures that showed growth so far in 2024 had only recovered lost ground from the recession last year. \u201cRishi Sunak claims we have turned a corner, but the economy has stalled and there is no growth,\u201d she said. Sunak said in March that the economy was \u201cbouncing back\u201d from a downturn in 2023. Responding to Wednesday\u2019s figures, a spokesperson for the Conservative party said: \u201cThere is more to do, but the economy is turning a corner and inflation is back down to normal.\u201d Manufacturing output fell by 1.4% month on month in April, while construction activity was 1.4% lower and retailers lost 2% of their trade. These declines were balanced out by a 2% rise across the whole services sector, boosted by rises in IT and communication services, professional businesses (1.2%), and arts and entertainment (2.6%). The general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, said the economy\u2019s stagnation was causing long-term harm to households\u2019 incomes. \u201cOur economy is slowing yet again,\u201d the TUC leader said. \u201cThis has been the worst government for growth in modern times \u2013 and working people have paid the price.\u201d He said analysis of official figures showed that annual growth had averaged 1.5% since 2010, the worst performance for a government since the great depression. Wages, after taking inflation into account, were worth less than 2008, Nowak added, and unemployment had risen at the fastest rate in the G7 this year. \u201cThe Conservatives can spin all they like. But the last 14 years have been dismal for growth and living standards.\u201d Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the economy could begin to grow again during the summer. \u201cDespite the stalling of the recovery in April, the dual drags on economic growth from higher interest rates and higher inflation will continue to fade throughout the year. That will generate a bit of an economic tailwind for the next government,\u201d he said. Separate surveys of private sector businesses show most areas of the economy have expanded month on month since the beginning of the year. Figures released last month showed the economy grew by 0.6% in the three months to the end of March \u2013 the strongest rate of quarterly growth since the end of 2021 \u2013 confirming the UK had officially exited recession after the economy contracted in the second half of last year. In the three months to the end of April growth was 0.7%, the same level forecast for the whole year by the International Monetary Fund in its biannual outlook in spring. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently downgraded its prediction for UK growth this year from 0.7% to 0.4%. The Paris-based organisation said longer-term issues faced by the UK, including a major skills shortage, high prices in the shops and elevated interest rates, accounted for the gloomy outlook. Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said April\u2019s zero growth rate in national income, or gross domestic product (GDP), was unlikely to encourage the Bank of England to cut interest rates at its meeting later this month. \u201cDespite these disappointing GDP figures, a June interest rate cut looks improbable, with the Bank of England likely to be a little wary of shifting policy in the middle of a general election campaign,\u201d he said."

Thoughts with him, cast and crew.\u201d An audience member, Paul Critchley, a Methodist minister from Norfolk, told the PA news agency: \u201cSir Ian seemed to trip as he moved downstage to take a more active part in the scene. \u201cHe picked up momentum as he moved downstage which resulted in him falling off the stage directly in front of the audience. \u201cThe house lights came up very quickly as the stage management and front of house team dealt with the incident. We were evacuated immediately so that Sir Ian could be treated in privacy. \u201cAn announcement was made by theatre management that the show had been cancelled, that Sir Ian was receiving treatment and an ambulance had been called. \u201cIt was a shock to witness his fall and I wish him a speedy recovery. My thoughts are also with his fellow cast members, stage crew and front of house team at the Noel Coward Theatre.\u201d Another member of the audience, Sandro Trapani, told the BBC the incident was \u201cvery shocking\u201d. \u201cI really hope that he is going to be all right,\u201d . \u201cAs far as I saw, he was conscious because he was asking for assistance.\u201d Player Kings is a production of Shakespeare\u2019s Henry IV Parts I and II, and started its 12-week West End run in April. The play, adapted and directed by Robert Icke, is due to move to the Bristol Hippodrome in July and will also be staged in Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle. McKellen\u2019s career has spanned more than six decades. On screen he is best known for playing Magneto in the X-Men films and Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, based on the books by JRR Tolkien. On the stage he has played Shakespearean characters including Richard II, Macbeth, Coriolanus and King Lear. His many acting credits have led to a number of accolades over the years including several Olivier Awards."

            "date": "2024-06-12T14:00:02Z",
            "content": "I\u2019ve talked a lot about the declining state of the games industry in 2024: after an infusion of cash during the pandemic, when everybody was looking for safe ways to distract themselves and socialise indoors and the games industry\u2019s growth was temporarily supercharged, this year has been an overcorrection. Studios and corporations that expanded too fast, made too many hires and acquisitions, have been laying off staff and shuttering studios. Developers looking for work have been finding fewer opportunities. And the games whose development was disrupted by the pandemic have been taking longer to make it out into the world, resulting in a comparatively sparse slate of titles this year compared with the bonanza in 2023. You could see Summer Game Fest \u2013 the smaller event in Los Angeles that has de facto replaced E3 \u2013 as a reflection of this diminishment. What was once an enormous, expensive-looking sensory assault of a trade show in the cavernous halls of the LA Convention Centre is now a small cluster of buildings a few blocks from Skid Row. What were once ostentatious press conferences are now 90-minute-long trailer livestreams that you can watch on your laptop. I found it hard not to feel glum on my first day in Los Angeles last week; I felt like the best days of the games industry might be well behind us. But maybe there\u2019s another way to look at it. In Los Angeles last weekend, presenter Geoff Keighley opened the Summer Game Fest showcase with a graphic showing the bestselling games of 2024 on Steam \u2013 and almost all of them are indie (or indie-ish) games. Among them were Palworld, the Pok\u00e9mon-with-weapons breakout hit of January; Helldivers 2, the squad shooter that Sony surely can\u2019t have had huge expectations for; Hades II, the Greek-mythology-flavoured arthouse action game; Manor Lords, about directing a feudal society; Balatro, the fiendish fever-dream poker game; and, uh, Supermarket Simulator. These are the most successful games in terms of units sold, but creatively, as I wrote last month, we\u2019re also in a brilliant period for independent games. The blockbuster end of the games industry is in the doldrums. Ballooning budgets and high-profile flops such as Redfall from Microsoft and Suicide Squad from Warner are resulting in a really boring approach, where seemingly every game has to either be attached to an enormous long-running franchise, or a live-service attention sink designed to get money out of players for years. The stakes are too high for any kind of risk-taking. The big publishers taking part in Summer Game Fest last weekend \u2013 namely, Ubisoft, EA and Microsoft \u2013 bore this out: the headline games of Microsoft\u2019s showcase were Call of Duty Black Ops 6, DOOM: The Dark Ages, Perfect Dark, Indiana Jones and Gears of War: E-Day, all part of decades-old franchises. Ubisoft had Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin\u2019s Creed, a series that began in 2007. EA had Dragon Age: The Veilguard, reviving a franchise last seen 10 years ago, and Skate, also ancient. All of these games looked good, as you\u2019d hope from entertainment products that cost hundreds of millions to make, but they\u2019re nothing new. Happily, there were hundreds of more novel games in the weekend\u2019s many trailer showcases, and playable in Los Angeles at the smallish campus where Summer Game Fest was held this year. I played UFO 50, a collection of 50 different, surprisingly substantial games wrapped up as an alternate-history 1980s anthology; Tales of the Shire, a game about cooking meals for your Hobbit neighbours; Fear the Spotlight, a 90s-flavoured horror game; Arranger, an arrestingly unusual role-playing puzzle game that reminded me of Crypt of the NecroDancer; and While Waiting, a darkly comedic cartoon game about wasting time and the essential futility of life that feels like a playable nihilistic comic strip. Watching the Summer Game Fest show and the other showcase livestreams over the weekend, I saw hundreds more. We\u2019re not seeing a great deal of innovation from the biggest companies in games right now. But as shown by that list of this year\u2019s top 10 Steam successes, the next breakout games might not come from them. Innersloth, makers of the pandemic-era megahit Among Us, announced during Summer Game Fest that they were setting up a new fund (amusingly called Outersloth) for indie developers with good ideas. Meanwhile, Blumhouse \u2013 the horror film production company \u2013 is getting into video games with its own label of lower-budget horror games, starting with a slate of six. I\u2019m seeing signs of creative regeneration at this end of the scale, and it\u2019s making me feel optimistic. During the heyday of E3, a decade or more ago, the event represented a games industry that always seemed to be in ascendancy. Everyone was competing, creatively and technically, to be the next big thing, to one-up each other with splashy reveals and showy events. It was gaudy and often tasteless, but it was exciting. These days the games industry already is the next big thing: it\u2019s a mature entertainment industry where the pace of change is slower and the biggest games and companies are unimaginably bigger than they were before. The most successful companies in games \u2013 EA, PlayStation, Nintendo, Epic Games with Fortnite, Riot with League of Legends, 2K with Grand Theft Auto \u2013 don\u2019t need to spend millions on a flashy event when they have millions of players already. There\u2019s less of that competition, less drive from game publishers and console makers to prove themselves. But there are also many more people involved than there were before: more players, more games, and more game creators at every scale, all over the world. Los Angeles in June isn\u2019t the centre of the gaming universe any more: the next big thing could come from anywhere. It\u2019s easy to see stagnation, assimilation and repetition if all you\u2019re looking at is the top end of the games industry. If you want to feel excited about the future, all you have to do is look elsewhere. What to play While you\u2019re waiting for Ubisoft\u2019s epic open world adventure Star Wars Outlaws, you should definitely check out Star Wars: Hunters. Just launched on smartphones and Nintendo Switch, it\u2019s a team-based arena shooter, which lets you take part as various creeds from the Star Wars universe including Jedis, bounty hunters, Wookiees and Jawas \u2013 all with their own weapons and skills, of course. Hunters is beautifully presented, featuring recognisable locations from the films, and lots of familiar sounds and music. Mobile gaming veteran Zynga has ensured that the surprisingly intuitive controls make it accessible for fans, whatever their shooting skills. Available on: Nintendo Switch, iPhone, Android Estimated playtime: 20+ hours What to read Amid the endless gunfire belching from hundreds of Summer Game Fest trailers over the weekend, the Wholesome Direct show, which streamed live on Saturday evening was an oasis of calm. Here\u2019s a nice interview with the organisers. Is Microsoft about to announce an Xbox handheld? VGC has rounded up all the evidence, including comments Xbox chief Phil Spencer made during an interview at the Summer Game Fest. It\u2019s worth checking out IGN\u2019s roundups, if you want to know what Ubisoft and Xbox have coming up Gears of War returns? Ten minutes of Star Wars Outlaws footage?! It\u2019s all here \u2026 I loved Polygon\u2019s roundup of the best garden games to play while you\u2019re outside this summer. It\u2019s quite US-centric, but fun \u2013 and things have changed a lot since Swing Ball \u2026 What to click Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 first look \u2013 300GB of spies, zombies and Margaret Thatcher Perfect Dark, Indiana Jones and a new Gears of War: all the new games from the Xbox Games Showcase Animal Well \u2013 beautifully wrought indie underground adventure Civilization 7 and more announced at Summer Game Fest SpaceWar is back! Rebuilding the world\u2019s first gaming computer Playing Kafka review \u2013 a well-intentioned but sanitised attempt at adapting the unadaptable Question Block This week\u2019s question comes from Oli Guy, one half of the Bonus Points podcast who asked on X: \u201cWhen interacting with water that kills the player, at what point should it kill them? Instantly? When it covers their head? Can\u2019t step in to it at all?\u201d Contained within this seemingly simple question is one of the most important dichotomies in modern game design process: is a video game an immersive role-playing experience in which authenticity is paramount, or is a game a machine of play, like a Monopoly board or a pinball table, where the failure state (ie drowning) should be as brief as possible so that the player can get back to playing. If the former is most important then we have a lot of problems \u2013 when a player falls into water, the game should do a lot of calculations about how heavy they are, if they have the skill to swim, if there are any strong currents, and then calculate the outcome \u2013 in this case, you\u2019d get a potentially lengthy drowning animation, but that will get boring after a while. That\u2019s the problem with reality. Look at fast travel \u2013 it\u2019s not realistic that you can instantly whiz from one point on the map to another but it is conducive to enjoyable play. So what do you do? A lot of games provide visual clues about the potential deadliness of water: shallow, safe stretches might be lighter in colour, for example; in the 2D era, water that could be traversed was often transparent, which told the player it was part of the explorable space (Sonic the Hedgehog for example), but if it was opaque (Aladdin) it was death juice. So there can be no definitive rule, because different games have different design approaches and priorities. It seems crazy that your characters in Elden Ring or Dragon\u2019s Dogma can\u2019t swim and will immediately drown, while Link can explore the waters of Hyrule as long as he has some stamina. In a realistic role-playing game, we should at least get a short, authentic drowning animation when the player character is exposed to deadly water \u2013 that would provide both a lesson and a punishment to the player. But in an online team-based shooter, it should be over as soon possible to get you back in the game. If you think this matter is trivial, the website TVTropes has a vast wiki on which games do or do not allow swimming, while the Elden Ring subreddit has long discussion threads about the deadliness of watery domains, where one user casually states, \u201cswimming lessons are expensive in the Lands Between\u201d. Ultimately, most players don\u2019t seem to mind if their character is subject to a gruesome drowning animation or just dies the moment they touch the surface. Just like in any area of game design or in fact life in general, people just want the rules to be clear and consistently applied.

            "date": "2024-06-23T15:58:47Z",
            "content": "International football tournaments have often delivered innovation, be it in playing styles, tactical approaches or the Romania team all dyeing their hair blond at France 1998. In recent years we have been able to enjoy (if that\u2019s the right word) another type of novelty: the technological developments that aim to help officials effectively apply the rules. This summer in Germany has continued the trend. Euro 2024 has brought the introduction of what Uefa calls \u201cconnected ball technology\u201d, a far less descriptive name for what cricket has long called the \u201csnickometer\u201d: a device that, through sound, picks up physical contact between objects. In cricket, there is a microphone in the stumps to capture the slightest snick between bat and pad. At the Euros, there is a microchip in the ball which performs the same function, and the devious little so-and-so recorded the slightest contact with Lo\u00efs Openda\u2019s hand during Belgium\u2019s defeat by Slovakia to make him the first player to be undone by \u201csnicko\u201d. Openda\u2019s undoing, with Belgium denied an equaliser, was perhaps the most notable \u201crefereeing\u201d intervention in the tournament so far, which is striking. The use of VAR at Euro 2024 has, by common consent, been seen to be doing well. Is this the future they promised us? Well, perhaps. Alongside snicko, fans, players and coaches have also been getting used to semi-automated offside technology (SAOT). It has been deployed before, making its competitive debut at the Qatar World Cup, but it has been more visible in Germany and has had more scrutiny as domestic leagues prepare to introduce the technology (it\u2019s coming to the Premier League this autumn). What SAOT has inarguably achieved is to reduce the time it takes for officials to make a decision. Using the aforementioned chip and calibrating it with body positions caught by cameras around the ground, the SAOT software saves VAR officials from having to spend time drawing fiddly lines. Now all they have to do is look at what the software produces and check it isn\u2019t glaringly wrong. Uefa will be sharing data on the performance of VAR and SAOT at the end of the group stage, but a rough count suggests predictions that SAOT could take 30 seconds off the average 70 seconds it has previously taken for VARs to make offside calls seem about right. The sense of a functioning system has also been aided by improved information, both in the graphics that show the offending offside body parts and explanatory text published on the big screen in the ground. Does that mean there have been no complaints? Of course not. On Friday night the decision to disallow Xavi Simons\u2019 goal against France, for offside against his Netherlands teammate Denzel Dumfries, provoked consternation and debate. Hungary\u2019s manager, Marco Rossi, made accusations of double standards after a foul was not detected by VAR in the buildup to Germany\u2019s opening goal in their Group A encounter (he insisted a foul was later given for a similar incident in the Germany box). The unfortunate Romelu Lukaku has had three goals overturned in two matches; one after the Openda snicko incident, another after an offside decision that involved the tip of his knee. Each of these controversies remind us that there are some things in football that no amount of technology can fix. The vast majority of the laws require subjective interpretation by officials. On the Simons goal, the question was whether Dumfries was interfering with the ability of Mike Maignan to get to the ball, though not whether the goalkeeper would have missed it anyway. Openda definitely triggered the snickometer, but did he do it intentionally as is required by attacking players other than the goalscorer if a VAR is to intervene? Officials decided yes. Rossi thought that Ilkay G\u00fcndogan had shoved Willi Orban; G\u00fcndogan said: \u201cIf you gave that as a foul in the Premier League, I think everyone would have been laughing on the floor.\u201d The one issue that has drawn a fair amount of heat was the time required to reach a decision on Dumfries, where the question was not whether he was offside \u2013 a law that does not require subjective interpretation \u2013 but whether he was interfering with play. It took nearly three minutes from the referee, Anthony Taylor, blowing his whistle for offside to the VAR, Stuart Attwell, confirming the on-field decision. And, yes, this is the same Attwell who provoked the ire of Nottingham Forest after \u201cmissing\u201d three penalties against Luton in a Premier League match (a refereeing panel said he should definitely have awarded one). Attwell could not rely on SAOT to reach his decision. That may not explain it all away, however, meaning that even away from home English officials are likely to remain under focus."

            "title": "Premier seeks \u2018innovative ideas\u2019 for 20,000 homes near Melbourne\u2019s CBD as seven skyscrapers approved for Box Hill",
            "date": "2024-06-24T08:33:03Z",
            "content": "The Victorian government has begun the search for partners to redevelop a huge parcel of land near Melbourne\u2019s CBD, as it approved the construction of seven high-rise apartment towers in the eastern suburbs. The premier, Jacinta Allan, on Monday announced the government had invited expressions of interest from private sector, industry and investors to turn the 13.5-hectare (33.4-acre) site in North Melbourne, two kilometres north of Melbourne\u2019s CBD, into a new housing precinct dubbed Arden. \u201cWe want to see the best, innovative ideas about how we can build 20,000 more homes on the Arden site, as well as to look at other commercial opportunities to create and support jobs in this area,\u201d Allan told reporters in the neighbouring suburb of Kensington. Meanwhile, on the other side of the city, the planning minister, Sonya Kilkenny, announced the approval of the Box Hill Central North master plan, which will see 1,700 new homes built over seven apartment towers ranging from 19 to 50 storeys tall. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Four of the apartment towers will surpass Box Hill\u2019s tallest building, the Sky One apartment tower, which at 36 storeys is also the tallest suburban Melbourne building. Kilkenny said the $1.57bn project aligns with the government\u2019s \u201clong-term vision\u201d for Box Hill, which is the end of the $34.5bn Suburban Rail Loop\u2019s east train line. As part of the rail project, the government has taken over planning controls within a 1.6km radius of each of the stations along the line: Cheltenham, Clayton, Monash, Glen Waverley, Burwood and Box Hill. The shadow spokesperson for planning, James Newbury, said the approval of the high-rise towers was proof the government \u201chas a plan to attack the character and amenity of Melbourne\u2019s suburbs around the Suburban Rail Loop\u201d. \u201cThese cheap and nasty developments will be a signature of premier Jacinta Allan\u2019s government,\u201d Newbury said. The Box Hill Central North master plan project was first unveiled by Vicinity Centres in 2020, and was fast-tracked under the government\u2019s development facilitation program, meaning at least 10% of apartments will be affordable housing. At Arden, the government also has a requirement of 10% affordable housing, as the land is state-owned. The premier said the government would give \u201cpriority\u201d to proposals that prioritise build-to-rent, build-to-sell and shared-equity initiatives, provide key worker housing and \u201cexceed\u201d the 10% requirement. \u201c[Arden is] about a four minute train ride to Parkville, to the University of Melbourne, the hospital precinct and the biomedical research precinct \u2013 a lot of key workers are needed to go in and out of that area every single day,\u201d Allan said. \u201cSo we want to see key workers prioritised and social and affordable housing prioritised.\u201d According to EOI documents, the government has separated the land into four \u201csub-precincts\u201d. The lowest heights and densities are expected in the north of the precinct, increasing closer to the new Arden station, which forms part of the Metro Tunnel. Walking, cycling and public transport will be \u201cprioritised\u201d in the precinct, along with open space and community infrastructure, including early childhood education facilities, a primary school and local health services. This is expected to be scaled up based on population growth and demand. The area\u2019s history with flash flooding has also been considered, with a requirement for an integrated stormwater management system to manage the risk. Jago Dodson, a professor of urban policy at RMIT University in Melbourne, said that based on the EOI documents, it appeared the government had \u201clearned\u201d from mistakes made in previous urban renewal projects, such as the Docklands and Fishermans Bend. \u201cWe are fortunate that at the time the precinct was being considered so was the Metro Tunnel and planning for both was done from the outset,\u201d he said, unlike Fishermans Bend, whereby there was really no consideration to the transport infrastructure that would be necessary for a precinct of that size, which is about four times the size of Arden in terms of expected population.\u201d He said the same lesson had also been applied to the Suburban Rail Loop, where precinct design and tunnel construction was being planned \u201chand in hand\u201d. Dodson said it was also \u201cgood to see\u201d that the government would continue to have a \u201cownership role\u201d in the Arden precinct, unlike the Docklands, where largely state-owned land was \u201csold off\u201d and planning was developer-led. \u201cThere\u2019s clearly some learning gone on since that episode,\u201d he said. The government had initially planned to use some of the land at Arden to create a new medical precinct, including new campuses for the Royal Melbourne and Royal Women\u2019s hospitals, but this was scrapped in the May budget, due to \u201celectromagnetic interference\u201d from the new station. The EOI documents show that the Arden Structure Plan was \u201cprepared on the assumption that there would be a new publicly funded hospital within the Arden Precinct\u201d, but it was now being built at Parkville and asked for bidders to consider the \u201cchange\u201d."

            "date": "2024-06-26T10:00:14Z",
            "content": "Hardly a week passes without another billionaire endorsing Donald Trump. With Joe Biden proposing a 25% tax on those with assets over $100m (\u00a380m), this is no shock. The real twist? The pro-Trump multimillionaire club now includes a growing number of venture capitalists. Unlike hedge funders or private equity barons, venture capitalists have traditionally held progressive credentials. They\u2019ve styled themselves as the heroes of innovation, and the Democrats have done more to polish their progressive image than anyone else. So why are they now cosying up to Trump? Venture capitalists and Democrats long shared a mutual belief in techno-solutionism \u2013 the idea that markets, enhanced by digital technology, could achieve social goods where government policy had failed. Over the past two decades, we\u2019ve been living in the ruins of this utopia. We were promised that social media could topple dictators, that crypto could tackle poverty, and that AI could cure cancer. But the progressive credentials of venture capitalists were only ever skin deep, and now that Biden has adopted a tougher stance on Silicon Valley, VCs are more than happy to support Trump\u2019s Republicans. The Democrats\u2019 romance with techno-solutionism began in the early 1980s. Democrats saw Silicon Valley as the key to boosting environmentalism, worker autonomy and global justice. Venture capitalists, as the financial backers of this new and apparently benign form of capitalism, were crucial to this vision. Whenever Republicans pushed for measures favourable to the VC industry \u2013 such as changes in capital gains tax, or the liberalisation of pension fund legislation \u2013 Democrats eventually acquiesced. On issues such as intellectual property, Democrats have actively advanced the industry\u2019s agenda. This alliance has shaped how the US now finances innovation. Public institutions such as the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health fund basic science, while venture capitalists finance the startups that commercialise it. These startups, in turn, build on intellectual property licensed from recipients of public grants to design apps, gadgets and drugs. A good chunk of these profits, naturally, flows back to the venture capitalists who own a stake in these startups. Thanks to this model, Americans now pay some of the highest drug prices in the world \u2013 yet when politicians have tried to curb these egregious outcomes, they have been met with accusations from the VC industry that they\u2019re undermining progress. Venture capitalists have been keen to emphasise the role they play in delivering progress. Through podcasts, conferences and publications, they have successfully recast their interests as those of humanity at large. For a clear distillation of this worldview, look no further than The Techno-Optimist Manifesto, a 5,200-word treatise by Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz. Its jarring universalism suggests that all of us \u2013 San Francisco\u2019s venture capitalists and homeless alike \u2013 are in this together. Andreessen urges readers to join venture capitalists as \u201callies in the pursuit of technology, abundance, and life\u201d. Yet his text quickly reveals its true colours. \u201cFree markets,\u201d he writes, \u201care the most effective way to organise a technological economy.\u201d (Andreessen has criticised Biden without endorsing Trump.) Andreessen isn\u2019t celebrating technology in the abstract, but promoting what he calls the \u201ctechno-capital machine\u201d. This system allows investors like him to reap most of the rewards of innovation, while steering its direction so that alternative models to Silicon Valley hegemony never achieve the kind of take-up that would allow them to drive out for-profit solutions. Andresseen, like all VCs, never stops to consider that a more effective technological economy might not revolve around free markets at all. How can VCs be so sure that we wouldn\u2019t get a better kind of generative AI, or less destructive social media platforms, by treating data as a collective good? The tragedy is that we won\u2019t be trying anything like this any time soon. We\u2019re shackled by a worldview that has fooled us into thinking there is no alternative to a system that relies on poorly paid workers in the global south to assemble our devices and moderate our content, and that consumes unsustainable volumes of energy to train AI models and mine bitcoin. Even the idea that social media might promote democracy has now been abandoned; instead, tech leaders seem more concerned with evading responsibility for the role their platforms have played in subverting democracy and fanning the flames of genocide. Where do we find the much-needed alternative? While researching my latest podcast, A Sense of Rebellion, I stumbled on a series of debates that took place in the 1970s and pointed in the right direction. Back then, a small group of hippy radicals were advocating for \u201cecological technology\u201d and \u201ccounter-technology\u201d. They weren\u2019t satisfied with merely making existing tools more accessible and transparent: they saw technology as the product of power relations, and wanted to fundamentally alter the system itself. I came across a particularly compelling example of this thinking in a quirky 1971 manifesto published in Radical Software, a small but influential magazine. Its author was anonymous, and signed themselves as \u201cAquarius Project\u201d, listing only a Berkeley-based postal box. I eventually tracked them down, partly because the points they made in that manifesto are so often lost in today\u2019s debates about Silicon Valley. \u201c\u2018Technology\u2019 does nothing, creates no problems, has no \u2018imperatives\u2019,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOur problem is not \u2018Technology\u2019 in the abstract, but specifically capitalist technology.\u201d Being hippies, the group struggled to translate these insights into policy demands. In fact, somebody else had done this three decades earlier. In the late 1940s, the Democratic senator Harley Kilgore saw the dangers of postwar science becoming \u201cthe handmaiden for corporate or industrial research\u201d. He envisioned a National Science Foundation (NSF) governed by representatives from unions, consumers, agriculture and industry to ensure technology served social needs and remained in democratic control. Corporations would be forced to share their intellectual property (IP) if they built on public research, and would be prevented from becoming the sole providers of \u201csolutions\u201d to social problems. Yet with its insistence on democratic oversight and sharing IP riches, his model was eventually defeated. Instead, our prevailing approach to innovation has allowed scientists to set their priorities, and does not require companies that benefit from public research to share their IP. As Biden\u2019s Chips Act directs $81bn to the NSF, we must now question if this approach still makes sense. Shouldn\u2019t democratic decision-making guide how this money is spent? And what about the IP created? How much will end up enriching venture capitalists? Similar questions arise with data and AI. Should big tech firms be allowed to use data from public institutions to train privately owned, lucrative AI models? Why not make the data accessible to nonprofits and universities? Why should companies such as OpenAI, backed by venture capital, dominate this space? Today\u2019s AI gold rush is inefficient and irrational. A single, authoritative, publicly owned curator of the data and models behind generative AI could do a better job, saving money and resources. It could charge corporations for access, while providing cheaper access to public media organisations and libraries. Yet the merchants of Silicon Valley are taking us in the opposite direction. They are obsessed with accelerating Andreessen\u2019s \u201ctechno-capital machine\u201d, which relies on detaching markets and technologies from democratic control. And, with Trump in the White House, they\u2019ll waste no time repurposing their tools to serve authoritarianism as easily as they served the neoliberal agendas of his Democratic predecessors. Biden and his allies should recognise venture capitalists as a problem, not a solution. The sooner progressive forces get over their fascination with Silicon Valley, the better. This won\u2019t be enough, though: to build a truly progressive techno-public machine, we need to rethink the relationship between science and technology on the one hand and democracy and equality on the other.

            "content": "The US will \u201ccontinue to be a leader\u201d in climate finance, the White House\u2019s top climate official has promised, though without specifying how much it would provide to poor countries. John Podesta, senior adviser to Joe Biden on international climate policy, also defended the large-scale US expansion of gas production, saying the world was fortunate America was strengthening its supply, given the demand for non-Russian sources after the invasion of Ukraine. \u201cThe US is in a position to be a leader in the effort [to supply climate finance to the poorer world],\u201d he said in an interview on Monday. \u201cWe intend to continue the leadership and be very aggressive in the negotiations during the course of this year.\u201d He pointed to the chasm on the issue between Biden and Donald Trump, his challenger for president this November, who is expected to rein back on US climate commitments if elected. \u201cObviously, there\u2019s a difference of views reflected in the two principal candidates running for president,\u201d said Podesta, who took over as chief adviser on the climate after John Kerry stepped down earlier this year. \u201cPresident Biden is committed to not only doing what we need to do to cut our own emissions in half, but also support the world as it\u2019s moving towards a more sustainable pathway.\u201d He would not say whether the US would commit greater sums to climate finance, but said it was on track to meet Biden\u2019s commitment to provide $11bn, a target that campaigners and developing countries have said is woefully inadequate given the size of the US economy and its responsibility for past emissions, but is many times greater than the $1.5bn on offer under Trump in his previous term. Podesta defended the huge US expansion of oil and gas production, which has come in spite of its climate targets, and the recent US decision to slap tariffs on many green goods from China, including electric vehicles. \u201cThe US is now the number one producer of oil and gas in the world, the number one exporter of natural gas, and that\u2019s a good thing, because following the illegal invasion of Ukraine, and the need that Europe had to rely on different sources rather than Russia fossils, it was important that the US could step up and supply a good deal of that need,\u201d he said. \u201cBut over time, the science is clear, we\u2019ve got to transition away and begin to replace those resources with both zero carbon electricity and renewable resources.\u201d He did not specify a time frame, but said the US was committed to cutting carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has previously said there can be no new oil and gas infrastructure if the planet is to avoid exceeding 1.5C (2.7F) of global heating above preindustrial times. The US had the most new oil and gas projects in 2022 and 2023, a recent report found, a surge in production that threatened internationally agreed climate goals. Podesta accused China of deliberately overproducing green goods, steel and aluminium, and using coal-fired power to do so, increasing global emissions. He added: \u201cThe economic security of the US and [its commitments to cut emissions] rely on the need to have an economy that is not overly dependent on a single source of supply, for critical minerals, for batteries, for other upstream green technologies. We need to diversify that supply. We\u2019re witnessing a renaissance of manufacturing in the US in the green technology space, and will resist unfair trade practices that are going to undermine that investment.\u201d In November, only days after the US presidential election, governments from around the world will meet in Azerbaijan for the Cop29 UN climate summit to come up with a \u201cnew collective quantified goal\u201d on climate finance from rich to poor countries, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impact of extreme weather. There is no consensus on how big that goal should be, though developing countries would like it to reach the trillion mark rather than the $100bn a year that is the current minimum. There is also no agreement on who should provide the cash. Countries classed as developed under the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change are the only ones obliged to provide finance, but many of those want other big economies and petro states, including China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to contribute. Podesta made it clear that the US wanted other countries to provide more. \u201cWe need a realistic commitment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need other contributors to support the needs of the world, including people with the resources and the obligation as a result of their own emissions to come forward into and try to support the global mobilisation that will come across the board from public resources from domestic resources from the private sector and from philanthropic resources to meet the massive need that is there.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-07T21:30:27Z",
            "content": "The Conservatives have promised to introduce a law that would unilaterally reverse the expansion of London\u2019s clean air zone and limit the use of 20mph routes in Wales, overturning the choices of voters in both places. In a pledge that, if implemented, would mark a significant reversal of devolution, the Tories said they would immediately introduce a backing drivers bill, which would use Westminster powers to quash local say over parts of transport policy. One element would reverse the most recent expansion of London\u2019s ultra-low emissions zone (Ulez), which widened to the perimeter of the capital the area in which older and more polluting vehicles must pay a daily charge. This would happen despite London\u2019s voters having endorsed the idea in May, when Khan was reelected as the city\u2019s mayor for a third term, easily beating the Conservative candidate, Susan Hall, whose main pledge was to scrap the expansion. A spokesperson for Khan said of the proposal: \u201cThis is desperate stuff from the Tories \u2013 a party completely devoid of ideas.\u201d The bill would also use Westminster powers to overturn local decisions on 20mph zones and so-called low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), a widely used planning technique that tries to keep through-traffic away from smaller residential streets. Wales introduced a widespread 20mph limit in built-up areas last year, something that was in the manifesto of the Labour party, which won the most seats in the 2021 Senedd election. While the plan has since been amended, to overrule a devolved government would be highly controversial. Another pledge for the bill would be to limit the use of LTNs, which are introduced by councils. Again, this would happen despite the bulk of councils that have created them in recent years being reelected in local elections. The proposed bill follows on from a \u201cplan for drivers\u201d unveiled by Rishi Sunak in September, which reversed years of transport policy, including under Conservative governments, by opting to prioritise the needs of drivers at the likely expense of bus passengers, cyclists and pedestrians. This proposed clampdown on LTNs and 20mph limits, as well as on bus lanes, achieved little, in part because such schemes are generally matters for local and devolved governments, and it proved tricky to overcome this. Another hiccup came in March, when a review of recent LTNs, commissioned by Downing Street in the apparent hope they would be found to be disliked and ineffective, concluded instead that, with some caveats, they were generally popular and worked well. The plan for drivers, as well as wider initiatives to rollback green targets, was devised in the wake of the Conservatives\u2019 unexpected if narrow win in a byelection in Uxbridge, west London, a result the party put down to the imminent expansion of Ulez to the area. Under the proposed bill, as well as limits on new 20mph zones and LTNs, residents in existing schemes could trigger a local referendum on them if 15% of those living in the affected areas signed a petition. The result would overrule the council\u2019s elected mandate. Sunak said: \u201cWe are the party on the side of drivers. We will empower drivers and local residents to challenge aggressive and punitive traffic-inducing measures, like low-traffic neighbourhoods that were imposed without local consent.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-17T16:17:07Z",
            "content": "Paris has lost its position as Europe\u2019s largest equity market to London, as investors reacted to political turmoil in France in the week since Emmanuel Macron called snap elections. Stocks listed on Euronext Paris were collectively worth about $3.13tn after about $258bn was knocked off the market capitalisation of French companies last week, putting it behind the London Stock Exchange\u2019s $3.18tn (\u00a32.51tn), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Separate data from the London Stock Exchange Group also suggested the market value of UK-listed companies was bigger. Macron\u2019s decision to call national assembly elections took most French political analysts by surprise, after a poor showing by his Renaissance party in the European parliamentary elections. Polls suggest the far-right National Rally (RN), led by Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, could become the largest party in the assembly, an outcome that would hobble the remaining three years of Macron\u2019s presidency, as well as breaking a longstanding taboo against extremist parties. RN\u2019s \u201cplatform of unfunded public spending\u201d is one reason why financial markets have been unsettled, wrote analysts from the investment bank UBS in a note to clients. \u201cThe probability of no clear majority emerging is high, leading to potential political instability.\u201d The UK\u2019s main stock exchange lost its crown to its French rival in 2022 when British politics was seen as more unpredictable. That occurred within a month of Liz Truss resigning as prime minister, after her government\u2019s promise of unfunded tax cuts triggered market turmoil. Investors now perceive lower uncertainty in the UK, despite its own general election on 4 July. Most polls indicate a strong Labour majority is likely, which has reduced uncertainty. The euro has also weakened against the pound since Macron announced the elections. Sterling rose from \u20ac1.1772 on 7 June, the Friday before the EU election results, to hit \u20ac1.19 last Friday. As Paris\u2019s stock market is valued in euros, while London stocks are priced in pounds, this currency effect bolsters the market capitalisation of UK stocks. France\u2019s banks were hit by last week\u2019s sell-off of French assets. Shares in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and BNP Paribas have both fallen about 7%. France\u2019s benchmark CAC 40 share index also suffered its biggest weekly fall since 2022. The French turmoil has also been reflected in bond markets. The gap between French and German borrowing costs widened to the most in seven years. That spread tends to widen when investors consider French debt to be riskier than Germany\u2019s. The largest individual stocks can also have an effect. The value of Paris\u2019s stock market has been inflated by the luxury goods maker LVMH, which in 2023 became the first European company to hit a $500bn valuation. Shares in the owner of brands including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Tiffany are down 9% in the past month. Data supplied by the LSEG showed that the London Stock Exchange\u2019s total market capitalisation is \u00a35tn, nearly \u00a32.2tn more than the next largest European venue, Paris, at \u00a32.81tn. London was also ahead of Paris if share listings alone were considered, but marginally behind Paris if this was restricted to domestic issuers, the LSEG added."

            "date": "2024-06-21T05:00:08Z",
            "content": "With a penthouse in Santa Monica, a rambling Georgian manor in North Yorkshire and a five-bedroom mews house in Kensington, Rishi Sunak knows a thing or two about the joys of home ownership. \u201cI want everyone to feel what I felt when I got the keys to my first flat,\u201d Sunak said in his recent televised debate with Keir Starmer, recalling the moment he stepped into his South Ken pied-\u00e0-terre for the first time. Launching his election manifesto, Sunak reiterated the Tory party\u2019s eternal commitment to estate agents, house builders and the transformational power of bricks and mortar. \u201cFrom Macmillan to Thatcher to today,\u201d he declared, \u201cit is we Conservatives who are the party of the property-owning democracy in this country.\u201d It is a familiar tune. But after 14 years of Tory rule, the prospect of home ownership has never been more distant for so many people, as house-price inflation continues to rocket far beyond wages. Two decades ago, a household with the median income could afford to buy an average-priced house in England. Now, they can afford only the cheapest 10% of properties. In the capital, the situation is even more absurd. An average first-time buyer in London now has to save for more than 30 years to afford a deposit on an average home. The result is ever more people trapped in the private rented sector, at the mercy of unregulated landlords and subject to rents that have reached a record high. The number of adults living with their parents has risen by 700,000 over the last decade, with about 30% of 25- to 29-year-olds now living back at home. Tory doctrine has created not a nation of homeowners, but a country of squeezed renters, overcrowded flat-sharers and rough sleepers, with the number of people sleeping on the streets more than double the figure when the Conservatives came to power in 2010. So what is Sunak\u2019s grand plan to fix this mess? His momentous proposal is to resuscitate the still-warm corpse of help to buy, the single policy that the government\u2019s housing strategy has relied on for the last decade. Like a B-movie sequel to Margaret Thatcher\u2019s right to buy, it is a policy that has defined the contemporary Conservatives\u2019 shameful housing record more than any other. It was billed as a silver bullet to boost home ownership, but it has only served to help the already well-off, increase house prices further, and pump public subsidies straight into the pockets of the party\u2019s favourite donor house builders. Sunak\u2019s promise to reboot the failed policy reveals a party that has not just run out of ideas, but which is determined to continue the damage it has already done. Help to buy was first introduced in 2013 by the then-chancellor George Osborne, and trumpeted as \u201cthe biggest government intervention in the housing market since the right to buy\u201d of the 1980s. Over the last four decades, that disastrous policy has seen two-thirds of Britain\u2019s council homes transferred from public to private hands, forcing local authorities to sell off more homes each year than they can build. Even the new generation of award-winning council homes is now being sold off, less than five years after they were completed. But help to buy was supposed to be different. \u201cIt\u2019s a great deal for homebuyers,\u201d said Osborne. \u201cIt\u2019s a great support for home builders. And because it\u2019s a financial transaction, with the taxpayer making an investment and getting a return, it won\u2019t hit our deficit.\u201d Win, win, win. So how did it work? The policy provided first-time buyers with an equity loan of up to 20% of the value of a new-build property \u2013 or 40% in superheated London \u2013 capped at a total price of \u00a3600,000. The buyer was required to stump up a deposit of just 5%, with the remainder covered by a traditional mortgage. It was a reaction to sluggish rates of housebuilding, when developers were still licking their wounds from the financial crisis, and banks were reluctant to lend more than 75% of a new-build home\u2019s value to purchasers, cutting many first-time buyers out of the market. The dubious logic behind help to buy was that by stimulating housing demand, housing supply would inevitably follow. Economists balked. As Christian Hilber, professor of economic geography at the London School of Economics, wrote at the time: \u201cHelp to buy will likely have the effect of pushing up house prices (and rents) further with very little positive effect on new construction. Housing will likely become less \u2013 not more \u2013 affordable for young would-be-owners!\u201d Duncan Stott, of the campaign group PricedOut, was equally prescient: \u201cHelp to buy should really be called \u2018help to sell\u2019,\u201d he wrote, \u201cas the main winners will be developers and existing homeowners who will find it easier to sell at inflated prices. Pumping more money into a housing market with chronic undersupply has one surefire outcome: house prices will go up.\u201d One decade on, this is exactly what has happened. A report published by the House of Lords built environment committee in 2022 concluded that the help-to-buy scheme \u201cinflates prices by more than the subsidy value\u201d and does \u201cnot provide good value for money, which would be better spent on increasing housing supply\u201d. What began as a three-year programme worth \u00a33.5bn ended up being extended for a full decade, and costing the taxpayer more than \u00a329bn. The Lords rightly pointed out that the cash should have been used instead to replenish England\u2019s falling stock of social housing. Research conducted by Hilber and his team at the LSE found that help to buy increased house prices in London by 8%, and boosted developers\u2019 revenues by 57% in the process. The researchers found the policy \u201cled to higher new-build prices but had no discernible effect on construction volumes\u201d, effects that are \u201carguably contrary to the policy\u2019s objectives\u201d. Worse still, they found that the policy actively stimulated construction \u201cin the wrong areas\u201d. It had the effect of catalysing out-of-town developments on greenfield sites, increasing commuting distances and car use, rather than helping to revive depressed town centres and stimulate development where employment and productivity is concentrated \u2013 where housing is needed most. Meanwhile, the house builders reaped bigger rewards than ever. Persimmon posted pre-tax profits of more than \u00a31bn in 2018 and 2019, a record matched by Barratt in 2022. Share prices across the industry rocketed, leading to huge bonuses for chief executives. Jeff Fairburn, the then boss of Persimmon, was notoriously awarded a bonus of \u00a382m, one of the largest such bounties in British corporate history, and was forced out as a result. Defending his payout, Fairburn was frank about the cause of the vast sum: \u201cIt\u2019s supply and demand, and the demand has been created through the help-to-buy scheme.\u201d So, who benefited at the other end? Did the policy really help to mint a new generation of homeowners, who wouldn\u2019t have otherwise been able to get a foot on the housing ladder? In total, the government says the scheme helped about 330,000 first-time buyers purchase a home, before it was axed in October 2022. But it seems the majority of beneficiaries were not the most needy. According to the housing charity Shelter, the government\u2019s own evaluation of the policy showed that only two in five help to buyers actually needed the programme to purchase a home. The majority used the subsidy to buy bigger and more expensive properties than they could otherwise have bought. Figures showed that the average salary of a first-time buyer using help to buy was \u00a350,000, 85% more than the typical private renter household. Only 19% of privately renting households earned that much, according to Shelter. Helping out the comfortably-off and lining the pockets of developers may have been a calculated part of the Tory policy. But help to buy has also had a major unintended consequence: leaving many buyers trapped in negative equity. When a home bought using the scheme is sold, the government gets 20% of the property\u2019s value based on its sale price, rather than the cost when the owner first bought it. Market stagnation, or a fall in value, can therefore leave buyers unable to move. A 2020 investigation by the consumer group Which? found that one in seven homes bought using help to buy had lost value, despite booming local property markets. Research by the estate agent Hamptons last year found that people who bought a new-build home were twice as likely to sell it on at a loss than second-hand homeowners. This is a consequence of help to buy having created massively inflated premiums on new-build homes \u2013 which quickly evaporated once the home had been lived in (and the shoddy reality of much new-build construction was discovered). The market distortion was particularly evident in flats, which are more likely to be bought by first-time buyers. Before help to buy was introduced, the premium on new-build flats was 5%, according to the property data company TwentyCi. By 2018, it had reached 37%, and by 2022, it had shot up to 65%. That\u2019s a lot of new-build flat owners who, also thanks to cladding scandals and ballooning service charges, will be locked into their poorly built towers for years to come."

            "content": "The US economy added 272,000 jobs in May, a sign the labor market remained strong amid high interest rates, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced on Friday. The number of May jobs was far higher than the 190,000 economists had expected and topped April\u2019s gains, when a revised 165,000 jobs were added to the economy. The report offered a mixed view of the jobs market. The unemployment rate rose to 4% for the first time since January 2022, up from 3.9% in April. The White House celebrated the news, which comes amid enduring public skepticism about the economy. \u201cThe great American comeback continues, but we still have to make more progress,\u201d Joe Biden said in a statement. \u201cOn my watch, 15.6 million more Americans have the dignity and respect that comes with a job.\u201d Unemployment has now been at or below 4% for more than two years \u2013 the longest streak in over 50 years. But the pace of hiring had slowed considerably in recent months, from 315,000 new jobs in March to 175,000 new jobs a month later. That month-over-month decrease was taken as good news by Wall Street, as a cooling labor market could encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The latest report is likely to reinforce the Fed\u2019s resolve to keep rates high. Though Wall Street had long hoped interest rates would come down by the summer, officials at the Fed continue to be skeptical about a rate decrease amid disappointing inflation figures. Inflation was at 3.4% in May, still above the Fed\u2019s targeted rate of 2%. Previous signs of cooling in the labor market included the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 job openings and labor turnover survey from earlier this week, which showed there were just over 8m open job positions in the US at the end of April, the lowest number since February 2021 and down 1.8m over the year. According to the executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, layoff figures have held steady, with US-based employers announcing 63,816 jobs cuts in May, around the same number of cuts announced in April. Layoffs are down 20% from this time last year, when a handful of major tech companies were announcing job cuts. The Fed will hold its next federal open market committee meeting next week and is expected to announce on 12 June whether officials will change interest rates. Interest rates are currently at 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest rates in nearly two decades. On Thursday the European Central Bank cut its interest rate for the first time in almost five years but few expect the Fed to follow suit this week. At their last meeting in early May, Fed officials said inflation was still too high above their targeted rate of 2% to cut rates. In May, inflation stood at 3.4% \u2013 higher than its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but also above the rate in June 2023, when it hit 3%. Inflation has not been below 2% since February 2021. \u201cIt is likely that gaining confidence will take longer than previously expected,\u201d Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said after the meeting in May. Federal officials are trying to manage a tough balancing act in seeking to bring price increases down to a manageable level without offsetting the labor market too much."

She confronts him outside his townhouse. He\u2019s all syncopated panic, she\u2019s got poise and dignity to burn. It\u2019s painful to watch, but there\u2019s worse to come: his new wife, the bearded lady Baba the Turk \u2013 married solely for what we might now call \u201cbanter\u201d \u2013 sits unseen in a sedan chair. Increasingly irate, she starts to interrupt Tom and Anne\u2019s reckoning. A veneer of comedy overlays the obvious tragedy. Emotional sincerity is pitted against heavily drawn irony. It\u2019s a scene that epitomises the knowingness of this neoclassical collaboration between Stravinsky, WH Auden and Chester Kallman. It can, despite everything, be very funny. But it wasn\u2019t in this new production at the Grange festival. Not for want of charisma from Rosie Aldridge\u2019s Baba, who was a force to be reckoned with \u2013 physically assured and armed with a magnificent chest voice, her comic timing precise. The opera\u2019s black humour nonetheless relies on a feeling of easy suavity in negotiating its rhythmic complexities that wasn\u2019t yet in evidence either on stage or in the pit, where Tom Primrose conducted the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. Directed and designed by Antony McDonald, the staging emphatically takes a backseat to the music. Its aesthetic is stripped back and largely two-dimensional, its array of painted flats presumably a reference to the William Hogarth paintings that inspired the opera. The lighting (designed by Peter Mumford) becomes increasingly gaudy \u2013 intentional, perhaps, though I assume the fact that Anne delivered much of her final aria with her head outside the spotlight was not. Aside from a couple of song and dance routines from the chorus (energetic, if not always tonally blended) and a piece of stage business with a tennis umpire\u2019s chair \u2013 nicely managed by John Graham-Hall as auctioneer Sellem \u2013 it\u2019s all very static. Instead, the voices themselves are crucial. In this young cast, Aldridge\u2019s Baba met her match in Alexandra Oomens\u2019 Anne: wide-eyed, yes, but also genuinely steely. As ultra-baddie Nick Shadow, Michael Mofidian was persuasive, his bass-baritone immense and sumptuous. Casting Adam Temple-Smith as the rake in such company, his tenor lucid but small, made the plot\u2019s power dynamic painfully audible, his physical awkwardness oddly effective alongside the ease of the two female leads. Catherine Wyn-Rogers was an intimidating Mother Goose (imagine Cruella de Vil as a brothel owner) and Darren Jeffery a warm Father Trulove. If Shadow remains the usual cartoon villain here, Baba the Turk \u2013 despite her neat goatee and harem pants \u2013 is no caricature. And, in the absence of comedy, what unfolds instead is intensely, memorably sad. \u2022 Until 4 July at the Grange festival."

            "date": "2024-06-21T09:18:04Z",
            "content": "Finding the finance needed to stave off the worst impacts of the climate crisis will be \u201ca very steep mountain to climb\u201d, the UN has conceded, as two vital international conferences failed to produce the progress needed to generate funds for poor countries. With less than five months to go before the Cop29 UN climate summit in Azerbaijan in November, there is still no agreement on how to bridge the near-trillion dollar gap between what developing countries say is needed and the roughly $100bn a year of climate finance that flows today from public sources in the rich world to stricken developing nations. Rich countries have so far given little indication that they are rising to the challenge. The G7 summit of heads of state of the world\u2019s richest countries, in Italy last weekend, skirted the topic of climate finance with warm words on the \u201cimportance of fiscal space and mobilising resources from all sources for increased climate and development action, particularly for low-income and vulnerable countries\u201d. Campaigners said the group\u2019s promises to \u201cwork on a coordinated approach\u201d were too vague and had little substance. Harjeet Singh, the global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said: \u201cThe G7 nations have once again failed to fulfil their obligations in responding to the climate crisis. Wealthy countries bear significant responsibility to developing countries for the harm they\u2019ve inflicted through years of extractive exploitation of resources and the consequent impacts caused by climate change. They owe trillions of dollars annually to hundreds of millions of people suffering and dying from climate impacts.\u201d Sima Kammourieh, the programme lead at the thinktank E3G, said: \u201cThe G7 leaders failed to present the full-fledged, structured and specific economic and financial action plan that is needed for global climate safety. At this juncture, more is needed than menus of options or high-level frameworks.\u201d Last Thursday, an exhausting fortnight-long meeting of ministers and officials in Bonn, the UN\u2019s climate headquarters, ended with similarly scant concrete results. Mohamed Adow, the director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, warned that without finance, developing countries could not hope to reduce their emissions and cope with the impact of the climate crisis. He said: \u201cDeveloping countries are expected to slay the climate dragon with invisible swords, having got zero assurances on the long term finance they need.\u201d Simon Stiell, the UN climate chief, warned: \u201cWe can\u2019t keep pushing this year\u2019s issues off into the next year. The costs of the climate crisis \u2013 for every nation\u2019s people and economy \u2013 are only getting worse.\u201d The failures have bruised already fragile hopes of reaching a global settlement that would provide the funds needed for poor countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the effects of worsening extreme weather. At Azerbaijan this November, at this year\u2019s conference of the parties (Cop) summit under the UN framework convention on climate change, governments are supposed to agree a new framework for climate finance and a \u201cnew collective quantified goal\u201d that would set out how much rich countries should provide to the poorest, and how the money should be collected and spent. Research by economists Nicholas Stern and Vera Songwe in 2022 suggested about $2.4tn would be needed annually to tackle the climate crisis by developing countries excluding China. Of that sum, about $1.4tn could come from countries\u2019 domestic budgets, leaving about $1tn to come from climate finance sources, such as the World Bank and other development banks. Developed countries largely agree such sums are needed, but are resisting the suggestion from some developing countries that it should all come from their taxpayers. Instead, they would like to see some coming from the private sector, and some from other sources, such as the carbon markets, or \u201cinnovative\u201d measures such as levies on fossil fuels, on frequent flyers or on international shipping. They also point to the fact that rich petrostates such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emirates have no obligation to contribute to climate finance, nor do countries with burgeoning economies that are still classed as developing, including China, South Korea and Singapore. There is no clarity over how any new forms of finance could be brought to bear. At the Bonn conference, the prospect of some form of levy on fossil fuels was floated but Saudi, UAE and some others resisted the idea even being discussed. While Bonn provided a little clarity on some technical issues, there was little political common ground. In Stiell\u2019s words: \u201cWe have left ourselves with a vast amount to do between now and the end of the Cop.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-01T19:03:06Z",
            "content": "Former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard has said global progress on gender equality is \u201creally glacial and slow\u201d as she warned that it is going backwards among young people. Gillard cited recent polling by King\u2019s College London\u2019s Global Institute for Women\u2019s Leadership, which showed that 51% of respondents believe that men are doing too much to support gender equality, while 46% think that men are now discriminated against. What is \u201cstunning and unexpected\u201d, she told the Hay festival, are the differences according to age, with 60% of men aged 16-27 thinking \u201cwomen\u2019s equality has gone too far\u201d, more than any other age group. Gen Z is also more than twice as likely as boomers to agree with the statement that \u201ca man who stays home with his children is less of a man\u201d. \u201cWe have got to get to grips with this, and we have to ask ourselves as feminists a fairly difficult and deep question about whether we have in our rhetoric and campaigning for gender equality been as careful as we should be to explain that actually gender equality will be better for everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about women getting unfair advantages, it\u2019s about creating a world where nobody is hemmed in by gender stereotypes, and that\u2019s better for men and for women.\u201d More needs to be done to dispel the idea of a zero-sum game in which women take men\u2019s jobs, noting that female quotas in Australian politics had proven successful, and that these initiatives are often \u201csensitive in transition but end point is one that people embrace\u201d, she said. As chair of Kings College London\u2019s Global Institute for Women\u2019s Leadership, she said she would like to feel that there was no longer a need for the organisation, but the \u201cresearch base is thin\u201d and there was desperate need to \u201csee problems clearly\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m very passionate that we accelerate the pace of change, and good research is critical to that,\u201d she said. Noting that the World Economic Forum estimates that gender equality around the world is still 130 years away, she said that, in 1998, a person would have more chance of being CEO of a FTSE company if they were named Dave or David than if they were a woman. That has improved marginally since, though Daves and Davids combined with Steve, Stevens and Stephens still outnumber women in the top corporate jobs. Unconscious biases need to be challenged as research suggests people tend to think that \u201cconfident, charismatic men\u201d make the best leaders, when in fact they typically perform worse than more collaborative and cautious women and men, she said. Kings College London research suggests that the gender split on political views is the biggest it has ever been, with young men more likely to lean right on gender and inclusion issues, whereas women are more progressive. \u201cThat spells trouble for the future of politics,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really have to understand what\u2019s happening around attitude formation in young men.\u201d While she said the drivers remain unknown, she suggested that it may be connected to early exposure to violent porn and \u201ctoxic influences online selling a version of masculinity that your manhood is best expressed by subjugating women\u201d. Although she had wanted to \u201cget on with it\u201d starting her job as Australia\u2019s first female prime minister, she couldn\u2019t ignore the growing characterisation of her building on social media as a \u201chateful, ambitious, clawing woman who didn\u2019t understand what empathy was, what nurturing was, what kind of woman chooses not to have children\u201d, and was moved to address misogyny head on in parliament. While research suggests that the traditional media is treating gender in politics better than it used to, she said \u201cthe seamy underside of social media has got so much worse\u201d, with abuse primarily targeted at women and in particular women of colour. \u201cWhy do we allow this to happen?\u201d she asked, saying she \u201ccan\u2019t believe\u201d it has not yet been possible to design better social media regulation. While she said she \u201cwasn\u2019t a shrinking violet when it comes to parliamentary debate\u201d, she warned that \u201cwe have pushed the pendulum so far now across democracies \u2026 to hyper-partisanship fed by the thinness of social media, everything\u2019s a binary, you\u2019re for or against it\u201d. She advocated \u201cdeliberate remedies and measures to put in place political and democratic systems that take us away from that\u201d such as involving citizens more in shaping decisions and other forms of direct democracy. She suggested reconfiguring parliaments to allocate members\u2019 seats randomly, so they are not sat in adversarial opposition, but would be encouraged to form bonds with each other. She also recommended the Australian model of compulsory voting, as well as the preferential voting system, meaning if you vote for a minor party as your first choice and it is eliminated, your second vote still counts. Asked about whether female leaders would improve progress in mitigating climate breakdown, she said the fact that people now for the first time believe their children\u2019s lives will be worse makes this challenging. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get people to come on big change journeys and show the social solidarity needed to do that if they no longer have faith that we can build a better future together.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-26T21:08:20Z",
            "content": "A storm had been brewing all night and, right on full time, it erupted. Once it had cleared Turkey\u2019s players bounced around in the centre circle, mimicked by the choirs encompassing them who somehow still had voices left. But first came the shower of bodies piling into each other near halfway, a brawl breaking out that gave the referee, Istvan Kovacs, plenty to do on top of what had already been an intimidating workload. It took Vincenzo Montella to hotfoot across from the technical area and pull Arda Guler away as his prodigy, substituted earlier, piled into the fray. Once the dust had settled Tomas Chory, the giant Czech Republic striker, had been shown a red card for his role in a fracas that appeared to start when Tomas Soucek took exception to Orkun Kokcu\u2019s exuberant celebrations. While all that was happening a pitch invader sent security personnel sprinting from one side of the arena to another in the latest suggestion that, whoever ultimately claims responsibility, crowd control measures this month are simply not up to scratch. For a few seconds it all resembled pixels flying across a screen and, for long periods, that was not an inaccurate description of the match itself. Turkey got the job done but this was a chaotic, patchy, increasingly tense affair that only felt comfortable when Cenk Tosun, who had replaced Guler in the 76th minute, broke away to blast the winner in added time. Turkey seem incapable of doing things the easy way and may struggle when they face the clean, robust, immaculately drilled style of Austria in a quintessential clash of dark horses next Tuesday. \u201cI was a little concerned because I didn\u2019t know what was going on,\u201d Montella said, referring to his dash to placate Guler. \u201cWe\u2019d had a few yellow cards, and didn\u2019t want any more bookings so that\u2019s why I immediately went there.\u201d By the time everyone had taken their leave, Kovacs had shown 18 cards of different colours. One in particular turned the game. Czech Republic, who could only go through with a win, had begun assertively and looked the better side until two exasperating moments from Antonin Barak. He was booked for an early foul on Ferdi Kadioglu and then, nine minutes later, he clipped Salih Ozcan\u2019s foot with studs up. It looked more a follow\u2011through than a malicious action and perhaps, given not even a quarter of the game had run, Barak could have been given one last chance. He held head in hands when the punishment was confirmed, trudging down the tunnel with the face of a man who knew the potential cost. In the end his team paid it. \u201cI must say it\u2019s a failure, we\u2019re going home, we\u2019re sad because this team was capable of advancing,\u201d said Ivan Hasek, the Czech Republic manager. They had almost scored after two minutes when Lukas Provod\u2019s deflected strike drew a full-stretch save from Mert Gunok and then, with 10 men, held out in relative comfort before half\u2011time. Gunok rescued Turkey again when David Jurasek broke through and there was a sense that chance needed to be taken. That was borne out after a rapid re\u2011emergence by Turkey, who were screamed on by three-quarters of the crowd. Jindrich Stanek seemed to have saved his side with a brilliant one-handed stop Kenan Yildiz but the rebound was only cleared to the edge of the box and worked left to Hakan Calhanoglu. The captain cut across the ball with the outside of his foot and laced a sumptuously clean, technically masterful finish across the keeper. Stanek had clearly hurt himself in making the initial intervention and had to be substituted in clear discomfort, perhaps with a dislocated shoulder. \u201cAn extraordinary goal, there are few players who can take a shot like he does,\u201d Montella said. Nobody can argue with that; his gripe was that, after being booked for apparent dissent, Calhanoglu will be ruled out of the Austria game. Montella was unhappy that, given the Uefa rules allowing captains to engage in dialogue with officials, his talisman had been censured. The bigger concern may be how Turkey lost their heads after that, being pegged back by a blast from Tomas Soucek after the recently introduced Chory had caused Gunok to drop a high ball. Tension radiated from all corners; Jan Kuchta had a goal ruled out for the Czechs but Tosun offered some form of calm before the late scrap. \u201cThey deserve this qualification,\u201d Montella said, but Turkey will have to sharpen up."

            "date": "2024-06-27T15:00:10Z",
            "content": "The final stage of the Tour de France is the most iconic aspect of the most famous cycling race in the world. Even casual fans can immediately picture the scene: a route that takes in the landmarks of Paris, culminating with a pulsating sprint along the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. The Tour first took place in 1910 and every one of the race\u2019s 110 editions have concluded in the French capital. But not the 111th. On Saturday, the 2024 Tour de France will begin in Florence. The location of the Grand D\u00e9part is appropriate for an unusual edition of the race; it is the first time in history the Tour has begun in neighbouring Italy. The peloton will cross the Italian countryside before navigating anti-clockwise around France and finishing by the Mediterranean in Nice \u2013 with the 21st stage taking place outside of Paris for the first time. The Tour will also conclude with an individual time trial, rather than a sprint \u2013 for the first time since 1989. The decision to depart from history and end in Nice was forced upon Tour organisers by the Olympics \u2013 the race finishes just five days before the opening ceremony begins in Paris. Logistical difficulties involved in any overlap were blamed \u2013 although the last time the Games were held in Paris, in 1924, the Tour finished in the capital as usual midway through the Olympics. In any event the 2024 Games will loom large throughout the Tour, with many riders eyeing off medal prospects in the Olympic road race and time trial. For cycling fans, then, the Tour serves up quite the entr\u00e9e before the Olympic main course. The general classification battle is hotly-anticipated, as defending champion Jonas Vingegaard seeks to shake off a major injury, while Slovenian star Tadej Poga\u010dar attempts to become the first rider in a quarter of a century to win the Tour-Giro d\u2019Italia double. The heavy-weight clash for the yellow jersey might also feature Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d and Remco Evenepoel, as the pair seek to challenge the dominant Vingegaard-Poga\u010dar duopoly (between them, the pair have won the last four editions). Limited Australian general classification options An Australian has only once won the hallowed yellow jersey \u2013 Cadel Evans in his famous 2011 triumph. But recent years have seen a considerable Australian threat in the general classification contest. In 2020, Tasmanian veteran Richie Porte ended years of Tour heartbreak with a podium finish. The following year it was Ben O\u2019Connor\u2019s turn, as the West Australian won his debut Tour de France stage and ultimately clinched an impressive fourth place finish. The 2022 Tour saw Australian cycling enter on a high, following Jai Hindley\u2019s historic Giro d\u2019Italia pink jersey triumph, before falling back to earth as O\u2019Connor and Jack Haig fell flat (although stage wins for Simon Clarke and Michael Matthews were worthy highlights). Last year Hindley won a stage and held yellow for a day, before ultimately finishing seventh. This year\u2019s Tour, in contrast, is not expected to see an Australian challenge for the yellow jersey. O\u2019Connor opted to contest the Giro \u2013 finishing fourth \u2013 and will have to wait until the 2025 Tour, at which he is expected to be racing for the Australian team Jayco\u2013AlUla. Hindley is being deployed as a super-domestique to Roglic for Bora-Hansgrohe; barring an unexpectedly poor showing or injury from his team leader, Hindley will be riding in a support role. And while Haig will ride for Bahrain-Victorious, his 16th place overall at the traditional pre-Tour warm-up race, the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9, did not suggest form that would see him challenging for the podium. Stage and sprint ambitions Instead, the six-strong Australian contingent at the Tour will be furthering team ambitions and targeting individual stages. Jayco\u2013AlUla are bringing a multi-pronged line-up to France, with British rider Simon Yates in general classification contention, Dutch fast-man Dylan Groenewegen challenging the sprints and former green jersey winner Michael Matthews able to tackle the intermediate stages. Matthews has been in good form this season, finishing second at Milan-San Remo and enjoying two top-10 finishes during the Spring Classics. Compatriots Chris Harper and Luke Durbridge will also line-up for Jayco\u2013AlUla. The Olympics await The 33-year-old Matthews will be among those in the Tour peloton keeping an eye on their fitness ahead of the Paris Games, with the three-time world championships medallist anticipated to be Australia\u2019s leader in the road race. The men\u2019s Olympic route will be a race of attrition, featuring almost 3,000 metres of climbing over 273km, which suits Matthews \u2013 the Canberran was not selected for Tokyo, but is an outside medal chance in Paris. With the Tour de France broadcast late into the evening on SBS, the race will also serve as a warm-up for bleary-eyed spectators ahead of the Olympics, which will largely take place overnight for Australian viewers. But for those who can endure the sleep deprivation, it will be an exciting month of racing ahead."

Volkswagen will initially invest $1bn as part of a partnership with Rivian to form a new, equally controlled joint venture to share electric vehicle architecture and software, the companies said on Tuesday. On Wall Street, shares in Rivian\u2019s stock jumped 33% when trading began on Wednesday following the announcement. The deal amounts to a significant win for Rivian, which is grappling with steep losses as it attempts to ramp up production of its electric trucks and sport utility vehicles. While EV startups have been dealing with a slowdown in demand amid high interest rates and dwindling cash, traditional automakers have struggled to build battery-powered vehicles and advanced software. The partnership between Rivian and Volkswagen will help Volkswagen accelerate its plans to develop software-defined vehicles (SDV), with Rivian licensing its existing intellectual property rights to the joint venture. The investment will provide Rivian \u2013 known for its flagship R1S SUVs and R1T pickups \u2013 the funding it needs to develop its less-expensive and smaller R2 SUVs that will roll out in 2026, the founder and CEO, RJ Scaringe, told Reuters.

            "date": "2024-06-20T15:00:42Z",
            "content": "The Victorian government quietly signed an agreement with Israel\u2019s defence ministry to capitalise on \u201cglobal tensions\u201d and countries wanting to \u201cprotect their national interests\u201d militarily, internal documents reveal. The 2022 Memorandum of Understanding, signed before the Israel-Gaza war, was intended to foster trade relations and \u201csupport greater collaboration on defence industry objectives\u201d, according to Victorian government documents released under freedom of information laws. The existence of the MoU between the Department of Jobs, Skills, Industry and Regions and the International Defense Cooperation Directorate of the Israel Ministry of Defense was first reported by the ABC but the exact details of its wording has not been released. The text of the MoU was redacted in full in the documents provided to Guardian Australia. But, according to talking points prepared for its signing on 7 December 2022, the MoU\u2019s purpose was to \u201cfoster trade relations between the Victorian and Israeli defence, aerospace, security and cybersecurity sectors\u201d. The notes cited \u201cglobal tensions\u201d, including the war in Ukraine and \u201cincreasingly militarised territorial disputes in our regions in the Pacific and Indo-Pacific ocean\u201d. They said it was important to form strong \u201cdefence alliances and industry cooperation\u201d between governments that \u201cshare the same interests\u201d. \u201cGlobally countries are investing significant funds to protect their national interests with military capabilities aligned to this environment,\u201d the speaking notes read. \u201cThis MoU is a pathway for meaningful cooperation between Israel and the state of Victoria to capture and share these opportunities.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Victorian minister for jobs and industry, Natalie Hutchins, said the government was \u201cnot supplying arms or weapons to Israel\u201d and the agreement was not legally binding. \u201cThe purpose of this MoU is to identify potential opportunities for collaboration on projects that can deliver significant advanced manufacturing capabilities, highly skilled jobs and economic benefits for Victoria,\u201d she said. \u201cNo joint projects have been identified or entered into under the MoU.\u201d Before the MoU, several suppliers to the Israeli Defense Forces had already established a presence in Melbourne. They include Elbit Systems, which established the Centre of Excellence for Human-Machine Teaming and Artificial Intelligence in Port Melbourne in 2021 with investment from the Victorian government. Despite the MoU being signed in 2022, an event briefing before its signing warned the department it would face criticism from civil society organisations and the Victorian Greens for its \u201cengagement or cooperation with Israel and companies in its defence and security industries\u201d. \u201cIsrael\u2019s ongoing conflict with Palestine continues to attract public and media attention, with the Victorian government already facing criticism for its provision of a grant to Elbit Systems Australia,\u201d the brief reads. \u2018Fairly standard\u2019 or \u2018shocking\u2019? Experts weigh in Jennifer Parker, expert associate at the ANU National Security College, said the language used to describe the MoU was unsurprising. \u201cThis is a fairly standard agreement, obviously signed prior to the current conflict, which is about promoting a state\u2019s defence industry. I\u2019d be surprised if other states didn\u2019t have similar agreements with other countries,\u201d Parker said. She said Victoria had a \u201csignificant\u201d defence industry, known for its infantry fighting vehicles and ammunition, that could learn from Israel, which is considered a world leader in defence technology. \u201cFor a relatively small nation, Israel has developed a pretty high-profile defence industry where they actually export to a significant number of nations,\u201d Parker said. \u201cIn terms of understanding how they\u2019ve managed to build up their industries to do that, I think there are good lessons there for Victoria. But I do think that this needs to be put in the context of when this MoU was signed.\u201d But Rawan Arraf, the principal lawyer and executive director of the Australian Centre for International Justice, said it was \u201cshocking\u201d the Victorian government went ahead with the agreement and urged its scrapping. \u201cThe Victorian government must drop all pretence about the importance of this relationship for national security or job growth, and cancel this offensive MoU,\u201d she said. \u201cIsrael\u2019s defence industry has long relied on testing its new technologies against Palestinians with catastrophic consequences.\u201d The documents also reveal the MoU was set to be signed by the Israeli president in 2020 but the event was cancelled due to Covid-19. But later that year new federal laws giving the foreign affairs minister the power to veto international agreements reached by state, territory and local governments and public universities were introduced. This meant the Victorian government had to seek federal approval before each stage of the process. In January 2022 the then acting foreign affairs minister, Simon Birmingham, allowed the state government to begin negotiations with Israel before his successor, Labor\u2019s Tim Watts, allowed Victoria to enter the agreement later that year. Another briefing document showed it was Israel\u2019s preference for the signing to take place there, and offered to \u201cfacilitate travel for Victorian government representatives to Israel or a third location to sign the MoU\u201d. But the department said it would not be possible, citing to \u201ccompeting demands\u201d and \u201ccaretaker arrangements\u201d due to a looming state election. The same briefing recommended the Victorian government request its MoU to be exempt from the public register, given its \u201csensitive contents and its linkage with national security\u201d."

            "content": "Labour appears poised to win a historic election victory on 4 July. In the series Life under Labour, we look at Keir Starmer\u2019s five key political missions, and ask what is at stake and whether he can implement the change the country is crying out for. \u201cIt\u2019s tough. It\u2019s very, very tough,\u201d says Glyn Potts, the headteacher at Newman Roman Catholic college in Oldham as he reflected on the challenges facing education in England. There is not enough money, his school is running a deficit and he is having to consider cuts to school trips and mental health support because of funding pressures. In May 2023 his school was downgraded from \u201cgood\u201d to \u201crequires improvement\u201d after an inspection by Ofsted. Potts, clearly devastated, says the accountability system is \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d, piling pressure on teachers who are \u201cdowntrodden and stressed\u201d and leaving in droves. Then there is the family hardship that teachers are dealing with on a daily basis in the classroom. A report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation earlier this month said schools are \u201cstaggering\u201d under the pressure of demand amid an epidemic of extreme poverty, as desperate families unable to afford food, clothing or heating increasingly turn to them for help. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more parents making demands on schools, where previously it wasn\u2019t a school issue,\u201d says Potts. \u201cI had one last week who was saying, \u2018I\u2019ve not got housing so it\u2019s all well and good you saying to me he\u2019s got to come to school, but until you can sort my housing out he won\u2019t be coming to school.\u2019 That was a conversation I didn\u2019t have when I started my career.\u201d Labour\u2019s manifesto promises to break down barriers to opportunity, but how effective will its policies be in tackling the education issues arising out of soaring levels of child poverty, increasing special educational needs, the widening attainment gap, high levels of pupil absence and a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention that means pupils are frequently taught by a non-specialist or a supply teacher? Potts approves of some of the changes Labour has promised \u2013 the 3,000 new school-based nurseries to improve access to quality childcare, the funded breakfast clubs for all primaries and the additional 6,500 teachers Labour has promised, funded by adding VAT to private school fees \u2013 though he says it will not address the reasons why people are not going into teaching and why they are not staying in teaching. Overall, however, he is not convinced that Labour is offering enough to make a difference. \u201cI was hoping they\u2019d be a bit bolder,\u201d says Potts. Analysts and thinktanks are also concerned about what is not included in Labour\u2019s manifesto, in particular details on funding. As the Education Policy Institute says: \u201cThe glaring omission in the Labour party manifesto is a commitment to protect school funding.\u201d Pupil numbers are expected to fall by 400,000 between now and 2028, which is already creating problems in schools with declining rolls. To protect the current total schools budget \u2013 rather than per-pupil spending \u2013 could cost \u00a33.5bn a year by 2028, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. \u201cThis would not be an easy sum to find in a tight funding environment,\u201d says Luke Sibieta, an IFS research fellow. And without any additional information from Labour, schools are \u201cin the dark\u201d about how their budgets might evolve over the next parliament. After last year\u2019s strike action in schools over pay, Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, is optimistic about a reset in relations between the teaching profession and the government, but he, too, believes Labour will have to go further to bring about meaningful change. \u201cIf things don\u2019t move beyond the manifesto commitments, problems could very much remain. We still have a school estate that needs repairing, a big \u00a34.4bn black hole in the high-needs budget [for children with special educational needs and disabilities] and we need \u00a33.2bn to get back to 2010 levels of spending power for schools. And there is nothing in the manifesto that indicates that sort of shift.\u201d Kebede is not without hope, pointing out that the last Labour government\u2019s flagship Sure Start policy was not in the 1997 manifesto, though it went on to become one of Labour\u2019s most popular and successful policies. \u201cWhile the manifesto leaves more to be desired, previous Labour governments have exceeded manifesto commitments in the past, and I\u2019m hoping for that really,\u201d says Kebede. Lee Elliot Major is professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter and co-author of Equity in Education: Levelling the Playfield of Learning, which sets out an equity-based approach in schools to help teachers improve the prospects of under-resourced and working-class pupils \u2013 a book the shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, is said to have read and enjoyed. \u201cMy hope \u2013 and I think there is a lot of reason to think there is hope on this \u2013 is that they will have a strong commitment to social justice, which I don\u2019t think has been there as much as it should have been in recent years. That hopefully will come through in some of the more detailed policies when they are in government. \u201cThey are being very careful to not be too radical \u2013 there are some things in the system that are working \u2013 but I think there will be a more sympathetic tone towards the education sector as a whole.\u201d The Labour cabinet, should Starmer win on 4 July, will be one of the most state-educated ever. \u201cThe lives that some of these politicians have led I hope will mean that there is this real commitment to social justice,\u201d says Elliot Major. He also thinks the manifesto has the potential to bring about significant change, in particular Labour\u2019s commitment to review the school curriculum \u2013 which many feel has become too narrow and academic \u2013 giving better access to the arts, music and sport. \u201cThat will have an impact on every pupil potentially.\u201d Labour\u2019s promises on Ofsted to \u201cenhance the inspection regime by replacing a single headline grade with a new report card system telling parents clearly how schools are performing\u201d, are also enthusiastically received by Elliott Major, who is hoping for a system of inspections that challenges but also supports the profession. \u201cIf we can do that, then that makes the job itself more attractive and that\u2019s one of the other big challenges for a new Labour government.\u201d Phillipson has made some heavyweight appointments to help her realise her ambitions for the country\u2019s children, most recently the highly respected Sir Kevan Collins, who will become Labour\u2019s school standards adviser if the party forms a government next month. Collins, who led education recovery efforts in England after Covid, quit the role after the then prime minister Boris Johnson radically scaled back his \u00a315bn catchup plans. The veteran education policymaker Sir David Bell, meanwhile, has chaired Labour\u2019s review of early childhood education. Like Collins, he has impressive credentials. A former chief inspector of Ofsted, a former permanent secretary at the Department for Education and as current vice-chancellor at the University of Sunderland, he also has first-hand knowledge of the challenges facing higher education. On post-16 education, Labour\u2019s manifesto promises high-quality apprenticeships and specialist technical colleges, but has little to say about the financial crisis facing many universities. It acknowledges that the current higher education funding settlement is not working for the taxpayer, universities, staff, or students, adding only: \u201cLabour will act to create a secure future for higher education and the opportunities it creates across the UK. We will work with universities to deliver for students and our economy.\u201d There is no detail, however. \u201cWe have an unsustainable funding system for universities at the moment,\u201d says Elliott Major. \u201cThere are some very unpalatable decisions to be made. Do you start increasing [tuition] fees?\u201d He thinks there will be a more positive relationship between government and the higher education sector under Labour but, he adds: \u201cI do think we need another review of the future sustainability of universities.\u201d With just over a week to polling day, Potts sounds tired and disillusioned. Is Labour offering anything that\u2019s going to make a significant difference to him and his pupils? \u201cThey\u2019re not selling hope, and that\u2019s the problem. With Tony Blair in 97 they sold hope. They had dreams. \u201cI think they\u2019re trying not to overpromise and I can completely understand why. But people need hope and education needs hope, and at the moment it doesn\u2019t feel from my position, and the way it would be for my school, that this is going to make the change, and that\u2019s what\u2019s disappointing.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-11T17:28:04Z",
            "content": "The Ukrainian president and his allies have used a major conference in Berlin to lobby international business for support in the country\u2019s reconstruction and recovery efforts even as it continues to be bombarded by Russia. Speaking at the Ukraine recovery conference, hosted by the German government, at which the topic of Ukraine\u2019s survival was centre stage, Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that Europe\u2019s peace was also at stake if his country was not able to protect and rebuild itself as it stood up to Russia. With Russia\u2019s military having destroyed enough energy infrastructure to \u201cpower the cities of Berlin and Munich\u201d, Zelenskiy appealed to the 2,000 participants, including business leaders, politicians and NGOs, to trust in Ukraine and its future by investing in it. \u201cUkraine is suffering from the most destructive form of the Russian view of energy as a weapon,\u201d he said. The World Bank estimates that the damage and destruction caused by Russia in Ukraine amounts to at least $486bn (\u00a3380bn). Zelenskiy said he expected the conference to produce a range of solid agreements valued at billions of euros. \u201cWe will leave this conference with agreements for billions of euros for our defence, regarding the production of military equipment and weapons in Ukraine, and for our energy, for repairing and building a new and more modern energy system,\u201d he said. Funding would also go towards education, rebuilding homes and supplying medical equipment, he added. Later on Tuesday, Zelenskiy addressed the Bundestag in person for the first time, drawing on historical parallels between the conflict and the division of Germany. \u201cA divided Europe was never peaceful. And a divided Germany was never happy. You don\u2019t need me to tell you this, you know it from your own experience. That\u2019s why you can understand why we Ukrainians are fighting against attempts to divide us \u2026 why we are doing everything, everything, absolutely everything so that we do not allow a wall to be erected in our country.\u201d But the event was boycotted by the far-right populist Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party, an opponent of supporting Ukraine\u2019s war effort, whose leadership said they refused to listen to a speech \u201cgiven by someone dressed in military fatigues\u201d, and the far-left BSW bloc of Sahra Wagenknecht. She said the government should make more effort to negotiate with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Mayors from Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv, Irpin, Lviv and Kyiv also travelled to Berlin, alongside several members of the Ukrainian cabinet, to appeal for support. Ihor Terekhov, the mayor of Ukraine\u2019s second biggest city, Kharkiv, which has recently been the focus of a brutal onslaught by Russian forces seeking to lengthen the frontline in the war, said contrary to the views of those who thought recovery could only happen once the conflict was over, it was vital for it to take place now, not least to give citizens hope. \u201cWe cannot wait. People need reconstruction as quickly as possible,\u201d he told the conference, explaining how 150,000 people had lost their homes in the city. \u201cIf you just take the issue of housing \u2026 a very strong emotional component \u2026 people see that reconstruction is under way, that houses are being built, that people are going to work. That is a motivation for people. It is emotional support,\u201d he said. Seeing reconstruction take place was what gave those who had left Ukraine the faith to return, and might prevent those who were thinking of leaving from doing so, Terekhov said. The mayor of Kharkiv joined Zelenskiy in appealing to the international community to boost Ukraine\u2019s air defence systems to enable it to better fend off Russian missiles. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, also called for an improvement in Ukraine\u2019s air defence capabilities, saying in an opening speech: \u201cThe best reconstruction is that which doesn\u2019t have to take place.\u201d Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, also stressed the importance of giving Ukrainians a long-term perspective, announcing that having fulfilled the conditions to join the EU, Ukraine would be able to begin accession talks with Brussels to become a full member \u201cby the end of this month\u201d. The Berlin conference, with representatives from 60 countries but excluding Russia and China, is seen as a run-up to a widely anticipated Ukraine peace summit in Switzerland to be held this weekend, to which 100 countries are invited. Russia has not been invited but said it would not have attended anyway."

            "date": "2024-06-03T04:00:24Z",
            "content": "Aid shipments into southern Gaza are being squeezed out by commercial convoys, humanitarian organisations say, at a time when Israel\u2019s military push into Rafah has choked off supply routes critical to feeding hundreds of thousands of people. Deliveries of food, medicine and other aid into Gaza fell by two-thirds after Israel began its ground operation on 7 May, UN figures show. But overall the number of trucks entering Gaza rose in May compared with April, according to Israeli officials. Part of the reason for the stark difference in accounts of what supplies reached the strip is a rise in commercial shipments. In May, the Israeli military lifted a ban on the sale of food to Gaza from Israel and the occupied West Bank, Reuters reported last week. Traders got the green light to resume buying fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy and other goods. Inside Gaza, residents say there is more food in markets, but prices are many times higher than prewar levels, and after months of fighting and displacement few people can afford to buy much. A group of aid agencies warned this week that there was a \u201cmirage of improved access\u201d, when efforts to feed Palestinians were on the verge of collapse. \u201cWhile Kerem Shalom remains officially open, commercial trucks have been prioritised, and the movement of aid remains unpredictable, inconsistent and critically low,\u201d a group of 20 aid agencies warned this week. In April, about 5,000 truckloads of aid came through Kerem Shalom and Rafah, the two main crossings into southern Gaza, UN data shows. In the last three weeks of May, just a few hundred came through Kerem Shalom; Rafah has been closed. Overall, however, Israel says the average daily number of trucks going into Gaza rose in May to about 350, from about 300 in April, and the \u201cvast majority\u201d of recent deliveries passed through Kerem Shalom, said Shimon Freedman, spokesperson for Cogat, the Israeli body responsible for humanitarian coordination. There was no priority for commercial shipments, he added. Ami Shaked, the manager of the crossing complex where shipments are checked by Israeli security, confirmed that truck deliveries for business were outpacing aid, but said it was driven by the commercial interests of logistics firms. \u201cThis problem is the same on two sides (of the crossing), the Palestinian sides choose to take the goods of the businessmen \u2026 the Israelis the same,\u201d he told journalists at Kerem Shalom. \u201cBecause if I have a contract with UNWRA [the UN agency for Palestinian refugees], they will pay, for example, 2,000 shekels for each truck. The market now (for) pure business is between 7,000 and 10,000 for each truck, so they prefer to take the goods of the businessmen.\u201d Aid organisations dispute that, saying they have long-term contracts for trucks, and when limited capacity to enter Gaza and move through a military zone is allotted to commercial trucks, it exacts a toll on the ability to ship in aid supplies. Obstacles include lack of permits from Israeli troops to drive to Kerem Shalom, and roads into the collection area that are snarled by commercial vehicles waiting to load and unload. \u201cThe Israeli military operation and activities since 6 May have been crippling to the humanitarian response,\u201d said Juliette Touma, communications director for UNWRA. \u201c(The reasons) include restrictions imposed on our movement, including to pick up humanitarian supplies from Kerem Shalom. The Israeli authorities have not been giving us enough authorisations to move \u2026. Also the area around Kerem Shalom has very, very quickly become extremely dangerous.\u201d Aid workers have long called for more trade into Gaza, to complement the supplies they can deliver. Food for sale allows those who can afford it to have a healthier, more varied diet, and potentially take some pressure off the demand for aid. But if bringing more food to markets comes at the cost of aid deliveries, it will deepen rather than relieve the hunger crisis that is escalating in southern Gaza. Last week, two child deaths from malnutrition were reported in Deir al Balah hospitals. \u201cFor the largest period in the war, Israeli authorities were almost exclusively allowing humanitarian supplies, although not enough of them. This made a whole population of 2 million people rely on humanitarian handouts and relief,\u201d Touma said. \u201cThen they started bringing in commercial supplies, once people had depleted their resources, and there\u2019s a huge issue of cash shortages in Gaza. Very, very few people will be able to afford those supplies that are coming in.\u201d After months of war, many Palestinians are running out of money, and almost all have trouble accessing cash. Most have been out of work for months, and those still getting salaries or with savings in the banks cannot use card or electronic payments, because power and communications networks barely function. The very few ATMs that are still functioning have queues many hours long, a low cap on how much can be withdrawn, and a percentage must be paid to protection groups that prevent theft and rioting at the cash machines."

            "date": "2024-06-19T11:56:28Z",
            "content": "As state visits go, Vladimir Putin\u2019s arrival in North Korea on Wednesday was relatively low-key. There was no long line of senior government officials on the airport tarmac in Pyongyang and only a small guard of honour. Beneath an ink-black sky, the Russian president stepped off the plane to be greeted by a handshake and a hug from Kim Jong-un, before being presented with a bouquet by a woman in traditional hanbok dress. But the modesty of the occasion was deceptive. Putin arrived in the North Korean capital from Moscow, via the Russian far east, in darkness, the leaders\u2019 motorcade making its way through \u201ccharmingly lit\u201d streets to the Kumsusan state guesthouse in the early hours of Wednesday. Despite \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 the unsociable hour, the two men reportedly shared their \u201cpent-up, inmost thoughts,\u201d according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency, but the world would have to wait for how those frustrations would feature in their two-pronged challenge to what Putin reportedly called during his visit the \u201chegemony and imperialism\u201d of the west. The inclusion of a mutual aid clause in their agreement \u2013 requiring one country to offer assistance if the other is attacked \u2013 was a sign of how far Russia-North Korea ties have come since Putin\u2019s first visit to Pyongyang, 24 years ago. But the leaders\u2019 \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership\u201d, agreed shortly before Putin left for a two-day visit to Vietnam, was an incomplete account of the summit. And for good reason: why add flesh to the bones of agreements that, in whole or in part, are likely to violate international sanctions against both regimes? In a repeat of their previous meeting in Vladivostok nine months ago, neither leader was expected to reveal what, if any, agreements had been reached on weaponry for the war in Ukraine in return for technological knowhow or food and energy aid for North Korea. There was nothing cryptic, though, about the mood music behind the agreement: that this was a meeting of minds built on a mutual necessity so urgent that their nemeses in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo appear powerless to apply the brakes. When Putin was last in North Korea, his host, Kim Jong-il, was still several years away from overseeing a nuclear test that would for ever change the world\u2019s calculations when it came to the country. When Putin met G8 leaders months later at a summit in Japan, he told Tony Blair, Bill Clinton and others that Kim appeared to be a man with whom they \u201ccould do business\u201d. Almost a quarter of a century on, much of the business being conducted with Pyongyang is clandestine and confined to a small group of allies led by China and Russia. The G8 became the G7 after Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea. Kim Jong-il died more than a decade ago, his youngest \u2013 and reportedly most capricious \u2013 son now at the helm of a state on the brink of becoming a genuine nuclear power. Just as 17 years of UN sanctions have failed to derail the younger Kim\u2019s quest for a nuclear-backed guarantee against aggression by a \u201chostile\u201d US, the condemnation that prefaced this week\u2019s Pyongyang summit is unlikely to derail the Kim-Putin axis. Their interests have aligned at a dangerous moment \u2013 in Europe, where war continues to rage in Ukraine, and in north-east Asia, where Washington and its allies must contend with a nuclear-armed North Korea and Beijing\u2019s intentions towards Taiwan and the South China Sea. But the long-term consequences of their partnership for the rest of the world remain unclear. The full VIP treatment arrived with daylight in Pyongyang, including a lavish ceremony in Kim Il-sung Square attended by soldiers, an orchestra and balloon-waving children. It ended with the two leaders being driven to the venue for their talks in an open-top car, their enormous portraits staring down beneath a bright blue sky. Later, they were expected to attend a gala concert and a state reception, and lay wreaths at a monument dedicated to the Soviet troops who helped liberate Korea during the second world war. How effective that show of hospitality proves for Putin\u2019s host remains to be seen. Much will depend on whether Russia agrees to share sensitive military technology with North Korea \u2013 something Putin did not rule out \u2013 in return for continued material support for Russian troops in Ukraine. Putin could reciprocate with food and energy assistance, as well as help with North Korea\u2019s space surveillance programme. More worrying would be any indication the two states could rekindle their Soviet-era relationship with a Nato-style military alliance that compels Moscow and Pyongyang to come to each other\u2019s defence in the event of a conflict. As Putin prepared to leave for Vietnam, it was not clear if the vow of mutual aid if either was attacked would extend to military assistance. \u201cThe answer to that question turns on whether the Russia-North Korea relationship is only a temporary marriage of convenience \u2013 or indicative of a deeper, more long-term alliance, akin to the relationship between the two countries during the cold war,\u201d Sue Mi Terry, a senior fellow for Korea studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote on the eve of the talks. If that latter proves to be the case, the repercussions will be felt well beyond Ukraine and the Korean peninsula."

            "date": "2024-06-29T20:09:34Z",
            "content": "America was meant to be Britain\u2019s route to the sunlit uplands of Brexit. Then, after hopes of a free trade deal evaporated, successive Conservative governments have set their sights lower, by trying to forge closer ties with individual US states. Now the civil servants responsible for delivering those state-level deals have been let go, in what a furious British businessman described as \u201can act of arson\u201d. Nearly a seventh of trade posts within British consulates in the US have been axed, with 24 people losing their jobs, 18 from 139 posts in the trade department. The decision was taken barely two weeks before Rishi Sunak called the general election. Many of the trade teams, based in the nine consulates across the US, had worked on trade pacts with Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, jetting around America to sign memorandums of understanding with governors of states including Florida, Indiana and Oklahoma. But more importantly, according to British business leaders in the US, the regional trade directors and their staff had decades of experience and had built up contacts with American businesses from Google and Meta to the heads of Hollywood studios. Jules Ehrhardt, a designer and investor, said there was \u201coutrage and disbelief in the British business community\u201d at the decision. \u201cThey are tossing out collective centuries of relational and institutional knowledge core to the UK-US trading relationship,\u201d he said. Ehrhardt moved to the US in 2012 to open the American arm of Ustwo, a digital design studio behind award-winning games such as Monument Valley, and worked with Google, Nike and Twitter, before founding a venture capital firm, FKTRY. He said the consulate directors had \u201cserved as the connective tissue\u201d between British and American business leaders, making introductions, giving advice and lending their expertise. \u201cWe shot ourselves in both feet by undermining Britain\u2019s \u2018gateway to Europe\u2019 status for American companies following Brexit, and were told to go west, and now we\u2019ve self-elected a lobotomy,\u201d Ehrhardt said. \u201cThis [is an] act of arson in the final stages of this government. We claim it is a special relationship, yet remove our people at the very heart of it.\u201d Allan Rooney, founder of Rooney Law, which has helped more than 300 companies from the UK, Ireland and Australia enter the US market, said the directors were \u201cabsolutely critical in building strong and mutually beneficial trade relationships between UK and US businesses\u201d. \u201cThe facilitation of strategic introductions that these directors provide is a massive benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cThey plug companies into a market they otherwise don\u2019t know anything about. They familiarise them via trade missions and other methods to support and understand the market and the subtle differences between the UK and the US \u2018doing business\u2019 culture. Removing that layer will impact trade relations. \u201cMore than a million Brits are employed by American businesses \u2013 I can\u2019t think of a more important trade relationship post-Brexit. It\u2019s critical. And I think the removal of a very large swathe of intellectual capital and institutional knowledge is potentially worrisome. It could strain the trade teams who are already short on resources.\u201d Another US-based British business executive said that there was very little stability in the UK\u2019s consulates because they were usually staffed by Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office officials who stayed in the US for four-year periods. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant revolving door,\u201d the executive said. \u201cThose are the people we lean on.\u201d William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cIf we want to grow our economy then we need to boost trade, so it\u2019s a concern if cuts are being made to the team supporting key export sectors in the US, our second largest trading partner. \u201cWe need to scale up, not slash, our support for companies seeking to enter or raise market share in the US. This is especially true as we hope to see deals on critical minerals and digital trade reached with the US federal government in the next year or so.\u201d Boris Johnson, Liam Fox and other Brexiters had hoped that signing a trade deal with the US would provide economic growth for the UK, but Johnson failed to persuade either Donald Trump or Joe Biden. Last June, Rishi Sunak signed an \u201cAtlantic declaration\u201d with Biden which allowed UK firms access to some US subsidies. State-level deals have seen some recognition of British professional qualifications and removed some regulatory barriers. A UK government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s trade and investment teams in America are fully focused on furthering UK interests in the US, driving investment and strengthening our trading relationship with our closest ally. We continually keep our structures under review to ensure they deliver maximum impact for the UK, ensure the highest quality service to businesses, while offering taxpayers the very best value for money.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-25T13:55:46Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s biggest wine producer, Chapel Down, is considering raising cash and even putting itself up for sale to fund more vineyards and build a new winery in a booming industry transformed by rising temperatures and tax breaks. Chapel Down in Kent is Britain\u2019s best-known producer, founded in 2002 and is expected to make 3.4m bottles of sparkling and still wines from last year\u2019s harvest. It is looking for more funds for its growth strategy, which includes investing in new vineyards, a new winery to be up and running for the 2026 harvest, and the development of its wine estate at Tenterden. It said: \u201cAs part of the review, the board will consider all alternatives, including investment from existing shareholders, investment from new shareholders, a sale of the company, and other relevant transactions.\u201d After posting revenue of \u00a318m last year, the company said it was on track for double-digit sales growth this year. Its shares have risen by 14.5% since their debut on London\u2019s junior Aim market last year, moving from the Aquis Exchange, and fell 1.2% on Tuesday, giving Chapel Down a market value of \u00a3111m. Britain\u2019s wine industry is still small and concentrated in southern England, but rising temperatures created better growing conditions for grapes, resulting in a boom in new vineyards. Vines are being planted as far north as Yorkshire and Scotland, and their UK number has almost tripled from two decades ago to 943. However, in traditional wine-growing regions such as Italy, Spain, France and southern California, extreme heat is expected to decimate harvests. British wine is also growing in popularity: almost a third of Britons said they would celebrate a wedding with English fizz in a recent Aldi survey, while 15% would serve up champagne at a divorce celebration. Britain is the fastest-growing wine region in the world, according to the property group Knight Frank. Between 2017 and 2022, England and Wales more than doubled wine production from 5.3m to 12.2m bottles, according to WineGB. It expects wine production to double again to 24.7m bottles by 2032. The UK has also caught the eye of Pommery and Taittinger, two of France\u2019s best-known champagne houses, which both bought land and planted vines in England about a decade ago, while the world\u2019s biggest sparkling wine producer, Germany\u2019s Henkell Freixenet, snapped up the English wine estate Bolney in 2022. Last year was a record harvest and will be remembered as a \u201cnear perfect year\u201d for vineyards, WineGB said. There was little spring frost, good flowering weather in June, and after a wet July and August some very warm spells in September and October. Russ Mould, the investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: \u201cChapel Down has made a name for itself over the years but the business appears to have a hit the ceiling in terms of scale. To grow even more, it really needs a big slug of cash to invest in the business and that might be better coming from a new, bigger owner, rather than going cap in hand to shareholders on an ad hoc basis. \u201cPlenty of big drinks companies would be in the market for a niche player like Chapel Down as it could add something new for them to get their teeth into, and also as a way of cross-selling products.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-17T07:13:27Z",
            "content": "Labour would try to improve elements of the UK\u2019s trade deal with the EU, Rachel Reeves has indicated, saying also that most financial services companies have \u201cnot regarded Brexit as being a great opportunity for their businesses\u201d. While Labour remains committed to not making any major changes to Brexit, the shadow chancellor\u2019s comments show that the party could nonetheless make more policy moves on EU trade links than previously believed. In an interview with the Financial Times, Reeves said that as part of wider moves to \u201creset\u201d Britain\u2019s global image, a Labour government would take a less adversarial approach to dealings with the EU, with less insistence on regulatory divergence. Areas where it could see closer alignment with EU rules could include the chemicals sector and a revised deal for workers in the City of London, Reeves told the paper. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone voted leave because they were not happy that chemicals regulations were the same across Europe,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cWhen my constituency voted leave it was purely because of immigration.\u201d She told the FT that the party could introduced a \u201cbespoke\u201d arrangement for the chemicals industry, to try to avoid costs connected to having to register products with a UK system. David Frost, the lead Brexit negotiator under Boris Johnson\u2019s government, who is now a Tory peer, rejected this argument, writing on X: \u201cExcept for free movement, people didn\u2019t vote against any single subset of single market rules \u2013 they voted against having the rules set in Brussels.\u201d The EU, which has long criticised British attempts to \u201ccherrypick\u201d the benefits of EU membership, is likely to respond extremely cautiously to any plans perceived to give special treatment to a country outside the bloc. After the announcement of a general election, diplomats said a closer relationship was possible, but only if the UK abides by \u201cresponsibilities and rules\u201d. A European Commission spokesperson declined to comment on the specific ideas outlined by the person likely to become the UK\u2019s next chancellor. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be commenting on every comment that is made in the context of the UK electoral campaign,\u201d said Eric Mamer. \u201cWe have discussion fora with [the UK] to manage the relationship and it is in that context that we discuss any issue that can come up.\u201d Reeves also said Labour could amend areas such as the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, saying this could benefit financial services. \u201cThe majority of people in the City have not regarded Brexit as being a great opportunity for their businesses,\u201d she said. Services and financial services were \u201cpretty much excluded\u201d from the Brexit deal, she said. While Reeves\u2019s proposals are modest, they represent something of a shift in tone for the party, which has thus far in the election campaign preferred to not talk about Brexit. In a seven-way TV debate last week, Angela Rayner, the party\u2019s deputy leader, joined Nigel Farage and the Conservatives\u2019 Penny Mordaunt in saying she would \u201cnever\u201d seek to rejoin the EU. In the interview, Reeves reiterated that a Labour government would never rejoin the single market or customs union, and would not even back a scheme for youth freedom of movement. The ability to amend any elements of the deal within such narrow parameters will be necessarily limited, and dependent on the EU wanting to do so. Also in the interview, Reeves said a Labour government would not always be entirely cautious on the economy and was willing to \u201cupset some people\u201d to boost growth, rather than \u201chaving a fight about different taxes\u201d. The bulk of the Conservative campaign so far has been based on trying to warn about what the party says would be tax rises under a Labour government, a narrative that Labour rejects. The Tory warnings have been echoed by friendly newspapers, with several front pages on Monday warning of supposed rises to a series of taxes under Labour. Reeves told the FT that her party could go ahead with its plans without even tax rises on the wealthy, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re not seeking a mandate to increase people\u2019s taxes. We\u2019re seeking a mandate to grow the economy.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-21T14:28:42Z",
            "content": "The Labour party has been drawing up options for how it could raise money through extra wealth taxes to help rebuild Britain\u2019s public services if it wins the general election, according to sources who have spoken to the Guardian. The proposals under consideration include increases in capital gains tax (CGT), first revealed by the Guardian two weeks ago, that could raise \u00a38bn. Another option under discussion could lead to significant changes to inheritance tax. The measure would make it more difficult to \u201cgift\u201d money and assets, such as farmland, tax free. Together with CGT increases it could raise up to \u00a310bn in revenue, according to one document seen by the Guardian. A senior Labour source said: \u201cWe are starting from ground zero with our public services and infrastructure. We have to show we are serious about borrowing and raising revenue from taxes if investors are going to walk in step with us. These measures are part of unlocking wealth and putting it to work.\u201d A second senior party source said: \u201cWe have to show we are credible when it comes to transforming the country. Fiscal credibility means reforming tax as well as prudent borrowing.\u201d Before making any decisions, Labour intends to present a range of options to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) for analysis, after gathering costings on individual measures from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Labour has been under pressure to explain how it will fund its plans for government, and sources admit there is frustration among some senior members of the party about the cautious approach it has taken during the election campaign. So far, Labour has said it will not raise income tax, national insurance or VAT \u2013 and it has ruled out applying CGT to primary residences. It denied that it has arrived at any final decisions over any other measures. A Labour spokesperson said: \u201cKeir and Rachel have made clear that our priority is growing the economy, not increasing taxes. We have set out fully costed, fully funded plans, with very specific tax loopholes we would close. Nothing in our plans requires any additional tax to be increased.\u201d In an interview with the Guardian this week, the shadow chancellor denied there were any plans for new revenue-raising in a budget due this autumn. Rachel Reeves said she was focusing on efforts to drive growth rather than \u201ctinkering around with taxes\u201d. However, sources have made clear that work is already under way to scope new ways of raising money if Keir Starmer becomes the prime minister. They said a series of draft documents and expert analyses had been worked on throughout the election campaign and circulated among senior officials and shadow ministers. One Labour memo, seen by the Guardian, was a briefing note that estimated increases to rates of CGT alone could generate \u00a38bn for the Treasury in the long term. There are also proposals to overhaul inheritance tax, with plans for a consultation that could launch in autumn. These could include radical changes, such as scrapping or updating the rules on agricultural land and business relief. HMRC could be instructed to prepare figures on a range of options next month, sources said. They would then go to the OBR, which would need 10 weeks to crunch the numbers and share its findings with the Treasury. The preparatory work suggests a budget could come in early October, as soon as party conferences are complete. Under the current CGT regime, profits from the sales of second homes or shares in businesses are taxed at a much lower rate than wages. Some senior figures believe that being more open about plans to raise wealth taxes to transform public services would improve turnout among traditional Labour voters. The tax options under consideration come amid growing criticism from experts about a \u201cconspiracy of silence\u201d over how the two main parties will afford to fund public services. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Labour and the Conservatives had not been clear about how they planned to address the \u201cvery tight fiscal situation\u201d facing the next government. The inheritance tax option being looked at involves changes in the rules for the tax on agricultural land and other family businesses, which industry experts regard as \u201cvery significant\u201d. At present, a person can claim up to 100% relief on the inheritance of agricultural land if it is being actively farmed. That has led to concerns that farmland is being snapped up by wealthy people keen to avoid inheritance taxes, and this is driving up prices and shutting out small businesses and farmers. Some in Labour want to scrap this as well as business relief, which allows a person to pass on a company or shares if it is unlisted with 100% tax relief. Plans being considered contain a sliding scale of options to weigh up the likely gain for the exchequer, including capping the benefit from agricultural and business relief at \u00a3500,000 for each person, rather than scrapping it. In some instances, both forms of relief could be claimed, allowing for a cap of \u00a31m for each person in effect. This would still raise about \u00a32.3bn by 2029-30, which would be at the end of the OBR\u2019s forecast period if it was introduced in March next year, according to a paper published by the IFS in 2023. The same figure appears in one of the internal Labour documents seen by the Guardian. Sources said wider changes were also being considered on gifts and inheritance tax. Currently, no inheritance tax is due on gifts if they are made by a person who lives for more than seven years after the gifts are made."

More on this, local housing allowance and a voter who surely didn\u2019t expect to be cornered by Rishi Sunak after the headlines. What happened today Labour | After being barred as the party\u2019s candidate for Chingford and Woodford Green, Faiza Shaheen announced she will run as an independent. Public sector pay | The president of the Trades Union Congress told Labour that enforcing tight public sector pay settlements will mean a new round of strikes. Reform UK | A woman has been charged with assault after Nigel Farage had a banana milkshake thrown at him in Clacton. Analysis: \u2018Kapow! It\u2019s the narrative wars\u2019 I don\u2019t know who won the debate, I\u2019m afraid. But as the dust settles, it\u2019s feeling like a risky moment for the reality-based community: Rishi Sunak\u2019s claim of a \u00a32,000 Labour tax rise for every working household has created a genuine possibility that this will be the day that the narrative wars spin out of control, and overwhelm what is actually happening, and what this election is actually about. Sunak used that \u00a32,000 figure repeatedly; Keir Starmer mystifyingly didn\u2019t challenge him on it for ages. But any fair-minded analysis \u2013 like this one by Larry Elliott \u2013 suggests that it\u2019s based on some extremely dubious assumptions, presented in a spirit of what looks like wilful and cynical dishonesty. (For example: it\u2019s \u00a32,000 over four years, not one.) The Treasury permanent secretary said it was wrong to present it as having been produced by the civil service, as Sunak did. The Spectator\u2019s Fraser Nelson, not renowned as a huge Starmer guy, applied a similar methodology to the Tories\u2019 spending plans and came up with a figure of \u00a33,000 per working household \u2013 also nonsense, but no more so. That is probably all you need to know about that, but it is certainly not all you\u2019re going to hear about it. Starmer\u2019s failure to challenge the figure became a central plank of the post-match analysis. This was widely put together with a snap YouGov poll that found Sunak beating Starmer on who viewers thought had won by 51% to 49%. Traditionally Conservative newspapers said Starmer was \u201con the ropes over tax\u201d, or greeted \u201cFeisty\u201d Sunak\u2019s performance with the word \u201cKapow!\u201d From here, useful explanations of why the figure was fake found themselves competing with the kind of meta-analysis that is fun to do, but doesn\u2019t shed any light on anything important. People who consider the phrase \u201cif you\u2019re explaining, you\u2019re losing\u201d the most dumbfounding political insight of our times argued that it was brilliant, actually, that Sunak made something up and cornered Labour into talking about their tax plans all day. Or had Starmer played a blinder by not debunking it live, thereby creating the conditions to spend a full day calling Sunak a liar? Two more polls came out, and both showed Starmer as the winner \u2026 but they weren\u2019t the first to be published, so they don\u2019t count. I don\u2019t want to write myself out of a job, but that kind of analysis is a waste of time for anyone who isn\u2019t actually running a campaign themselves: it\u2019s all essentially based on vibes. Also, it\u2019s fine to not have an opinion on whether this was smart politics or not. It\u2019s possible just to wait and see. The main things to remember are that the figure was dubious, that debates don\u2019t usually radically change the dynamics of election campaigns, and that it looks like the Tories are miles behind. The other thing worth keeping in mind: many of those coming down on the side of \u201cSunak was telling the truth and/or is being clever\u201d are incentivised to construct a Conservative comeback in the days ahead \u2013 either because that\u2019s who they like, or because it makes things more interesting than a procession to a large Starmer majority. Meanwhile, the larger and probably more consequential dishonesty remains on the edges of the conversation: the fact that both parties know that public services are in desperate need of investment, that growth alone won\u2019t cover the bill, and that they\u2019ve amputated most of the ways they might have paid for it. Instead, they come up with spurious figures for the other side\u2019s commitments, and try to talk about those instead. The FT puts the figure for the two sides\u2019 allegations about the other\u2019s \u201cfinancial black holes\u201d at over a trillion pounds. What\u2019s at stake For a new series examining underexplored aspects of the Conservatives\u2019 legacy, the excellent housing journalist Peter Apps has written about one of the less familiar aspects of the welfare cuts landscape: changes to local housing allowance (LHA). The rate used to be set to the \u201c50th percentile\u201d of local rents \u2013 meaning that you could claim enough to rent the cheapest half of properties in an area. In 2014, it was reduced to the 30th percentile, and has been largely frozen since 2016. As Apps explains: The result was a predictable disaster: rents in inner city areas were increasing exponentially, but the benefits people could claim to pay them were not \u2026 The effect was obvious: tenants who were either out of work, or employed in one of the many critical sectors where wages are too low to cover the rent, could no longer pay the bills. They started to lose their homes. That means rising homelessness, huge new pressure on council budgets through the need for temporary accommodation \u2013 and fundamental changes to the composition of cities. We are seeing poorer families shipped out of higher-rent areas. London boroughs have looked to the Medway towns in Kent, the north-west, Stoke and Blackpool to make housing offers to those in need. The latest research estimates 40,000 households per year are being moved outside of their area: ripped away from schools, GPs, family and support networks. The result is a dearth of key workers and schools closing due to a lack of children. The whole piece \u2013 including Apps\u2019s prescription for an incoming Labour government \u2013 is well worth your time. Winner of the day Richard Holden, the Conservative chair, who was imposed as the candidate in Basildon and Billericay, bringing his long and painful search for a safe seat to an end. But Essex Tories are furious about not getting a local choice, with councillor Andrew Baggot calling it \u201cabsolutely shameful.\u201d Loser of the day Ed Davey, surely the most surprisingly newsworthy candidate of the campaign so far, who has now been fined for breaking the speed limit on the M1 and failing to send in his driving licence details. \u201cThe only mitigation \u2026 was just being super-busy,\u201d he said.

            "date": "2024-06-26T16:34:22Z",
            "content": "The Kenyan president, William Ruto, has withdrawn a bill to raise taxes a day after violent protests erupted around the country following its approval by parliament. Ruto\u2019s surprise decision not to sign the finance bill came after violent clashes between police and protesters at the Kenyan assembly and across the country left at least 23 people dead and scores wounded, according to medics. \u201cListening keenly to the people of Kenya, who have said loudly that they want nothing to do with this finance bill 2024, I concede. And therefore, I will not sign the 2024 finance bill, and it shall subsequently be withdrawn,\u201d he said in a press briefing in Nairobi. The climbdown will be seen as a major setback for Ruto, who came to power vowing to help Kenyans cope with rising costs but has seen much of the country, led by youth, unite in opposition to his latest attempt at reforms. In an attempt to further defuse the volatile situation, Ruto proposed a dialogue with young people, civil society, religious organisations and professional bodies on the bill. He also directed austerity measures to reduce expenditure in his office, the executive, parliament, as well as in the judiciary and county governments \u201cto ensure that we do live within our means, respecting the very loud message that is coming from the people of Kenya\u201d. The move will be considered a victory for the week-old protest movement that grew from online condemnations of tax increases into mass rallies demanding a political overhaul, in the most serious crisis of Ruto\u2019s two-year-old presidency. Kenya, east Africa\u2019s largest economy and a pillar of peace in a relatively turbulent region, is reeling from Tuesday\u2019s protests. Thousands of people gathered in Nairobi, the capital, with some storming into parliament and other offices of government institutions and setting parts of them fire. Police opened fire and shot teargas on protesters. At least 23 people were killed and another 30 were being treated for bullet wounds, according to the Kenya Medical Association. Protests also took place in other cities and towns across the country. Last week, one person was killed and at least 200 others were injured in demonstrations, according to human rights groups and the Independent Policing Oversight Authority, a police watchdog. In an unusual move, Kenya\u2019s defence minister, Aden Duale, on Tuesday announced the deployment of the military to support police, \u201cin response to the security emergency caused by the ongoing violent protests\u201d. Kenya\u2019s high court on Wednesday ordered the military deployment suspended after a challenge by the Kenya Law Society. Before backing down, Ruto had described Tuesday\u2019s events as \u201ctreasonous\u201d and blamed the violence on \u201ccriminals\u201d. On Wednesday Ruto acknowledged deaths, calling it an \u201cunfortunate situation\u201d, and offered condolences. He said about 200 people had been wounded. The protests have been driven largely by youth-led digital activism, with young Kenyans using X, TikTok and other platforms to oppose the bill, crowdfund, organise and mobilise demonstrations. On Tuesday, nongovernmental organisations said there had been 21 abductions and disappearances by officers over the past 24 hours, with some of the victims having been vocal on social media about the planned protests. Nicodemus Minde, a researcher with the Institute for Security Studies in Nairobi, said lingering questions about those killed and injured during the protests, as well as those missing, could mean the protests continue. Protesters had earlier vowed to keep up their demonstrations in messages on social media using the hashtag #tupatanethursday, or \u201csee you on Thursday\u201d in a mix of Swahili and English. Posts on social media had urged people to occupy State House, the president\u2019s office and residence, on Thursday, and the local offices of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday. Heavily armed police patrolled the streets of Nairobi on Wednesday, which were quieter than usual. Edith Wanjiku, the mother of a teenager killed, told journalists at a morgue that the police who shot her 19-year-old son should be charged with murder because he had been unarmed. \u201cHe had just completed school and was peacefully protesting,\u201d she said. Opposition leader Raila Odinga called for dialogue, asserting that Kenya\u2019s constitution had been suspended. \u201cKenya cannot afford to kill its children just because the children are asking for food, jobs and a listening ear,\u201d he said in a statement.

            "title": "Labour would raise taxes rather than cut spending if growth is weak, says IFS",
            "date": "2024-06-24T09:12:09Z",
            "content": "A Labour government would raise taxes or soften debt rules rather than cut spending in the event that stronger growth fails to rescue it from tough post-election choices, the head of a leading thinktank has said. Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the pressures on spending \u2013 including from public sector pay \u2013 were so powerful that he couldn\u2019t envisage a Labour chancellor making cuts to balance the books. Asked at a press conference on the party manifestos what Labour would do in the event that growth is weaker than expected, Johnson said: \u201cThe pressure to change the fiscal rules or find more money from tax will be quite significant.\u201d The IFS director said doctors were pushing for higher pay, teachers had faced a 25-year pay squeeze and civil servants\u2019 pay had been held down. \u201cThere are so many pressures on spending it is very hard for that to be the thing that gives.\u201d Labour has said it would stick to the current government\u2019s spending plans and meet the rule that debt should be declining as a share of national income after five years. It has announced modest tax rises to fund for additional spending on items such as hiring new teachers and increasing the number of dental appointments. The IFS said both the main parties were ducking the hard choices that they would face after the election, leaving voters operating in a knowledge vacuum. Although he doubted whether Labour would cut spending, Johnson said that on the basis of the manifestos it was not known how the next government would respond to weaker than expected growth. \u201cIf taxes are to go up, we do not know which ones. We certainly don\u2019t know how they would respond if things were to get worse.\u201d In a withering assessment, the IFS said neither manifesto recognised the pressure on the public finances caused by a \u201ctoxic mix\u201d of low growth and the after-effects of the pandemic and the energy crisis. Johnson said: \u201cThe choices in front of us are hard. High taxes, high debt, struggling public services, make them so. Pressures from health, defence, welfare, ageing will not make them easier. That is not a reason to hide the choices or to duck them. Quite the reverse. Yet hidden and ducked they have been.\u201d Johnson said huge decisions would need to be taken over the size and shape of the state, and these would probably require either higher taxes or worse public services, but you would not guess this from reading the manifestos. \u201cThey have singularly failed even to acknowledge some of the most important issues and choices to have faced us for a very long time. As the population ages, these choices will become harder, not easier. We cannot wish them away,\u201d he added. Johnson said commitments to improve the NHS were essentially unfunded promises and that a \u201cconspiracy of silence\u201d meant neither main party had made any serious proposals to raise taxes. \u201cDespite a (damaging) rush to rule out increases in all sorts of tax rates, it will be a considerable surprise if no other taxes are increased over the next five years. After all, they are currently much higher than was implied by the 2019 Conservative party manifesto.\u201d Johnson said the manifestos told voters more about what they wouldn\u2019t do than what they would. \u201cTax locks \u2013 pledges not to increase specific taxes or tax rates \u2013 aren\u2019t new. But this time, the parties have really gone to town. We\u2019ve seen something of a tax lock arms race,\u201d he added. \u201cThese tax locks are a mistake. They will constrain policy if a future government decides that it does in fact want to raise more money to fund public services. They also put serious constraints on tax reform \u2013 something which the Conservatives seem to have all but ruled out, and which is notable in the Labour manifesto by its absence.\u201d"

            "content": "Italy\u2019s far-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has been accused of \u201csplitting the country\u201d after parliament approved a controversial bill granting regions more power, which critics say will increase poverty in the south. The change, approved by the lower house early on Wednesday after a fiery debate that lasted all night, is part of the government\u2019s overhaul of the Italian state, including a bill approved by the upper house on Tuesday that would allow for the direct election of a prime minister. The \u201cdifferentiated autonomy\u201d bill, sought by the wealthy rightwing-led Lombardy and Veneto as well as the leftwing Emilia-Romagna, gives regions more power over how their tax revenues are collected and spent, and over public services such as health and education. The approval of the bill, which passed with 172 votes in favour and 99 against, was hailed by Matteo Salvini, the leader of Lega, the ruling coalition member which for years has championed the move, as \u201ca victory for all Italians\u201d. Meloni said it was \u201ca step forward towards building a stronger and fairer Italy\u201d, and argued it would \u201covercome the differences there are today between various parts of the country\u201d. Critics say that if the wealthier regions are able to keep more of their tax earnings it will mean fewer financial resources for poorer regions, which are predominantly in the south. The measure was so bitterly contested it led to a brawl in parliament last week, with a politician from the opposition Five Star Movement needing medical assistance. The fight triggered a demonstration by opposition parties in Rome on Tuesday night, who said they were rallying \u201cto defend national unity\u201d in the face of the two bills and to protest against alleged \u201cviolence and intimidation\u201d by the ruling coalition. Elly Schlein, the leader of the centre-left Democratic party (PD), said the measure was divisive and would increase inequality. \u201cMeloni, the patriot who splits the country,\u201d she said. \u201cBrothers of Italy has bowed to Lega\u2019s secessionist dreams.\u201d The bill allowing the direct election of a prime minister is a significant constitutional overhaul which Meloni has vigorously promoted, describing it as \u201cthe mother of all reforms\u201d. Under the proposal, the prime minister would be elected for five years and the coalition supporting the winning candidate would be given at least 55% of seats, a law Meloni argues would help end Italy\u2019s revolving-door governments. Critics fear the bill, reminiscent of a constitutional change made by the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini about a century ago, could lead Italy towards authoritarianism. Any change to the constitution must be approved by both houses of parliament with a two-thirds majority. The upper house vote fell short, a result expected to be repeated in the lower house, meaning the bill will almost certainly be put to a referendum, which could be held in 2025."

The mayor, Sadiq Khan, walked at the front of the march alongside his wife, Saadiya, as well as Andrew Boff, a Conservative London assembly member, and Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, an air quality campaigner. Khan said in a statement: \u201cI\u2019m delighted that London\u2019s diverse LGBTQI+ communities and allies are once again joining together in the heart of our capital for our world-renowned Pride celebrations and march of solidarity. \u201cPride is one of the highlights of my year and it is an honour to have been on every march since I was first elected as mayor in 2016.\u201d The celebrations are organised by the not-for-profit Pride in London, with an estimated 500 LGBTQ+ community groups and businesses taking part, comprising more than 32,000 people. The mayor added: \u201cThis incredible event is a shining light for LGBTQI+ rights and shows why our city is a beacon for openness and inclusion \u2013 a place where you are embraced and celebrated for who you are. Our capital\u2019s LGBTQI+ communities make a huge contribution to life in London. \u201cThere is, however, still work to be done to achieve true equality, and as a proud ally, I\u2019ll continue to stand side by side with our capital\u2019s LGBTQI+ communities as we work to build a better London for all.\u201d Before the event, Transport for London warned there may be disruption and tube station closures, with other stages placed around the capital, including Soho Square, Leicester Square and Victoria Embankment Gardens. Eight Christian protesters gathered alongside the Pride parade reciting religious sermons criticising the march, PA Media reported. The activists stood within a fenced-off section adjacent to the parade route. Several police officers were stationed around the protest, set up on Piccadilly, to prevent potential clashes. The group held placards that read \u201cRepent and turn to Christ\u201d and \u201cBe not proud, for the Lord hath spoken ... a man\u2019s pride shall bring him low\u201d. A man from the group addressed the parade through a loudspeaker and was met with jeers from marchers. Marchers from the group Queers for Palestine also walked down Piccadilly chanting \u201cthere is no pride in genocide\u201d. The 50-person group held posters accusing Israel of genocide and condemning \u201cpinkwashing\u201d \u2013 the accusation that Israel takes a progressive position on gay rights to improve its international reputation. Asked why she wanted to join the group, one female marcher who did not want to be identified said: \u201cFree Palestine.\u201d Tahir Kesai, a 50-year-old working in property, said: \u201cWe decided to march because we think it\u2019s important to be here.

Arriving after midnight at his mooring on London\u2019s neglected third river, the Roding, I find myself in a susurrating darkness that almost subsumes the late-night traffic noise. Paul didn\u2019t say, either, that the final section of plank would be slimy with rain and listing precariously above the water. But I make it, and install myself in his floating yurt, where I\u2019m spending the night. London is out there, not muted, but blurred into a saltmarsh soundscape. The sense of being surrounded calls to my drowsy mind a line in Maurice Sendak\u2019s Where the Wild Things Are: \u201cThat night \u2026 the walls became the world all around.\u201d I wake to bright sunshine and a blast of Cetti\u2019s warbler song \u2013 as loud and assertive as the wren I hear at home, but sharper, and without churring trills.

The world really is all around. I start to explore the thatch of vegetation along the riverside path \u2013 an eclectic mix including nettle, bramble, yarrow, teasel, black horehound, oxtongue, goat\u2019s rue, fennel and dream-inducing mugwort, whose nicknames include river wormwood (apt) and naughty man (intriguing). Among the reeds, naughtier still, are the deadly umbels and fronds of hemlock water dropwort. The diversity is unexpected, but not accidental. Paul is a co-founder of the Lawyers for Nature collective and the founder of the River Roding Trust, and his activism never sleeps. He points out several smaller trees, hidden in the botanical throng. \u201cThe Trust took on this scrap of land for nature restoration. \u201cThis is not a wealthy neighbourhood, but nature is for everyone.

            "content": "Keir Starmer has ruled out imposing capital gains tax on the sale of people\u2019s homes and said it was \u201cdesperate\u201d tactics from the Tories to suggest that he would. The Labour leader said he could \u201cabsolutely\u201d guarantee that would not happen. While Labour has explicitly ruled out increasing the rates of income tax, VAT and national insurance, it has largely responded to questions about its wider tax policy by saying there were \u201cno plans\u201d in the manifesto that required tax rises beyond those set out in the document. The Tories have claimed that Labour is planning a series of secret tax raids, including the possibility of making the sale of a primary residence liable for capital gains tax. Starmer told reporters on a visit to a hospital in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, on Saturday: \u201cThis was just a desperate story by the Tories in relation to capital gains tax on primary residences.\u201d He added: \u201cThere was never a policy so it doesn\u2019t need ruling out, but let\u2019s rule it out in case anybody pretends that it was.\u201d His comments come after Fraser Nelson, the editor of the Spectator , criticised the Conservatives, accusing them of believing they have a \u201clicence to lie\u201d in election campaigns. When asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme how Rishi Sunak\u2019s team had reacted to Nelson calling out the Conservative leader\u2019s disputed claim that Labour\u2019s plans would mean \u201c\u00a32,000 in higher taxes for every working family in our country\u201d, the journalist said: \u201cIt\u2019s strange they seem to think they\u2019ve got a licence to lie during election campaigns. Political adverts aren\u2019t regulated by the Advertising Standards Agency, so you can say things there that would get you prosecuted. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if they expect tribalism from journalists on the right, but journalists are going to point out untruths when they\u2019re seen. Suffice to say, it didn\u2019t go down very well, but we had the same stuff from David Cameron\u2019s side during the election campaign. The Spectator is a journalistic outfit which exists to tell readers what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not.\u201d However, the former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell, who was also part of the radio discussion, later said: \u201cI must point out, Fraser, and fair play to you for calling out the Tory lies, but you did once have a permanent compulsive liar in Boris Johnson, as your editor.\u201d Much of the Tory discussion now centres on Nigel Farage and the challenges the Conservatives face from the Reform party. In a television interview, Johnny Mercer, the veterans minister, said: \u201cIf you vote Reform, you\u2019re going to get a Labour government.\u201d And in an interview with the Times, David Cameron, the foreign secretary, said Farage was \u201ctrying to destroy\u201d the Conservative party. He also criticised Farage\u2019s \u201cinflammatory language\u201d and \u201cdog whistle\u201d politics, adding there was no room in the Conservative party for Farage\u2019s \u201cincredibly divisive\u201d approach. \u201cHe [Farage] is currently trying to destroy the Conservative party by standing for Reform,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cI want to be as sure as we can that we get no Reform members of parliament and the Conservative party can move forward.\u201d He added: \u201cI think there\u2019s room [in the Conservative party] for people who care about immigration. I think there\u2019s room for people who want to stand up for strong defence. But the other baggage you get, which can be incredibly divisive, we don\u2019t want that. \u201cMy point is what I want is robust policy and measured language. I think with these populists what you get is inflammatory language and hopeless policy.\u201d Questioned by the Times on Farage\u2019s claim that Rishi Sunak \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand our culture\u201d, Cameron responded: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to watch sheepdog trials to hear a dog whistle.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-15T07:00:14Z",
            "content": "Alaska\u2019s capital city is to limit the numbers of cruise ship passengers arriving at the port amid concerns over tourism\u2019s growing impact, but a leading critic of the industry has said further measures to protect Alaskans\u2019 quality of life are needed. Located on the Gastineau Channel in southern Alaska, Juneau has a population of 32,000 and last year received a record 1.65 million cruise ship passengers \u2013 a 23% increase from the previous high. While many businesses encourage the bonanza of tourist dollars, other people are bothered by buzzing helicopters, crowded streets and hiking trails, and damage to the local environment. Seeking to balance the economic benefits against the effects of high numbers of visitors, the city reached an agreement last week with the Cruise Lines International Association in Alaska that will limit daily cruise passenger arrivals to 16,000 from Sundays to Fridays and to 12,000 on Saturdays. Juneau\u2019s tourism manager, Alexandra Pierce, said: \u201cThe city\u2019s position is that we do not have room for cruise growth with our current infrastructure and we have negotiated the daily passenger limits to bring down our busiest days.\u201d The agreement aimed to hold cruise passenger numbers roughly steady while the city worked on improving infrastructure, she said. \u201cCruise tourism is important for our local and regional economies and we need to be good neighbours while also finding the balance between concerned residents and the local livelihoods that depend on the visitor industry,\u201d Pierce said. A former gold-rush town set near an imposing glacier, amid lush rainforests, towering mountains and abutting a pristine waterway that is home to humpback whales, Juneau has become Alaska\u2019s most popular port for cruise ships. Karla Hart, a Juneau resident and longtime critic of the cruise industry, remains concerned that the daily visitors allowed under the new agreement could still see arrival records broken over the course of the 22-week cruise season. \u201cThe city\u2019s direction to the staff was to hold the number or somewhat reduce it, and yet we now have a negotiated agreement that, if you do the math, would let us have 2.5 million cruise-ship passengers,\u201d she said. Instead, Hart is backing a local referendum proposal for \u201cship-free Saturdays\u201d, a policy that would prevent ships with more than 250 passengers stopping in Juneau one day a week. \u201cOur ballot initiative is really looking at providing some quality-of-life protection for the community that we can tangibly see and feel one day a week by not having the cruise ships in our port,\u201d she said. The cruise industry is booming after the pandemic, and the ships are getting bigger. Some vessels are now able to carry close to 6,000 passengers, with insiders saying the industry is still far from reaching the limits of how big they can get. In January, the world\u2019s largest cruise ship to date, Icon of the Seas, was launched. It towers 20 decks above sea level, carries more than 7,000 passengers and crew, and has the world\u2019s largest waterpark on a ship. Juneau is not the only city concerned about the growing social and environmental impacts of cruise ships. Venice and Barcelona have restricted access, while Amsterdam has introduced a day tax on passengers. Hart said: \u201cAir and water emissions from the cruise ships are a big concern, as well as ship strikes and climate change. The list goes on.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 17 June 2024. Owing to an editing error, an earlier version said that Venice had banned cruise ships from the city\u2019s lagoon; this is no longer the case, though they cannot enter the Giudecca canal."

            "content": "The Liberal Democrats are to announce plans to overhaul capital gains tax to raise \u00a35bn for the NHS, making them the first party to announce a big tax change as part of their spending plans. The party\u2019s leader, Ed Davey, said the change was \u201cmaking tax fairer\u201d and the party said it would hit only the wealthiest. The party will unveil its manifesto on Monday. The estimated \u00a35bn raised by the tax rise would be directed into plans to recruit 8,000 more GPs in order to meet a target of a guaranteed appointment in seven days. The revenue raised would also be put into cancer treatment, speeding up waiting times for treatment to guarantee care within 62 days. The party will say that those on lower incomes would be protected by an increase in the annual tax-free CGT allowance to \u00a35,000, up from \u00a33,000 in the current tax year. The proposed new system would be adjusted for inflation and there would be a targeted relief system devised for small businesses. The policy puts health and social care at the centre of the Lib Dems\u2019 offer at the election \u2013 where Davey has put his experience as a carer for his disabled son at the heart of his message to the public. The Lib Dems have already announced a plan for free personal care including washing and medication for disabled and older people, funded by reversals of tax breaks for banks estimated at \u00a32.7bn \u2013 though independent thinktanks have said the cost is likely to be higher. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said her party will not make changes to CGT, though some in the party believe there is a case for an overhaul that would be a significant revenue raiser. Several thinktanks have said that the two main parties are not being honest with the public about the state of the public finances, as Labour and the Tories have ruled out any big tax rises. Last month the Institute for Fiscal Studies said there was a \u201cconspiracy of silence\u201d over necessary tax and spending choices, with the next government likely to inherit the toughest outlook for the public finances in 80 years. The Lib Dem proposal would create three bands to be applied to taxable gains at different rates: gains between \u00a35,000 and \u00a350,000 taxed 20%; those between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3100,000 taxed at 40% and those over \u00a3100,000 at 45%. Davey said the NHS was in desperate need of a rescue package. \u201cWe are putting fixing health and social care at the heart of our party\u2019s plans for the country,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder this Conservative government, local health services have been decimated while hospitals crumble. \u201cAfter years of devastating tax hikes from Rishi Sunak, it would be grossly unfair to force hard-working families and pensioners to pick up the tab for Conservative failings on the NHS. That is why the Liberal Democrats will rescue health and social care services by making tax fairer, with billionaires and big banks asked to pay their fair share.\u201d Other big offers in the Lib Dem manifesto would be a pledge for an EU-wide scheme to allow under-35s to live and work in Europe, new paternity leave rights and a crackdown on sewage pollution. The party is heavily targeting seats in the south-west and London commuter belt, the so-called \u201cblue wall\u201d, where it hopes to take votes from liberal voters disillusions with the Conservatives. Almost all the party\u2019s target seats were held by the Conservatives, including some by senior cabinet ministers such as the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, in Godalming and Ash, and the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, in Chichester."

            "content": "A new era of protectionism is leading to slower global growth and hindering attempts to eradicate poverty, the World Bank has warned. The Washington-based institution said 80% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 more than 6 billion people \u2013 were living in countries where growth would be slower in the next three years than in the pre-Covid decade. In its half-yearly global economic prospects, the World Bank said the model of international cooperation that had allowed the poorest countries to close the gap with the wealthiest had fractured. Even though the global economy had avoided recession, it had stabilised at a lower level than in the years leading up to the start of the pandemic. Indermit Gill, the World Bank\u2019s chief economist, said policymakers had cause to celebrate a \u201csoft landing\u201d despite the steepest rise in global interest rates since the 1980s. \u201cBut they would be wise to keep their eye on the ball: growth rates remain too slow for progress. Without stronger international cooperation and a concerted push for policies that advance shared prosperity, the world could become stuck in the slow lane.\u201d The bank\u2019s forecasts show global growth holding steady at 2.6% in 2024 before edging up to an average of 2.7% in 2025-26. In the pre-Covid decade, growth averaged 3.1%. Gill said progress towards prosperity occurred when governments put in place policies that fostered productivity, entrepreneurship and innovation \u2013 and when they did so while cooperating. \u201cThat was the model that flourished after the fall of the Berlin Wall. By encouraging the flow of goods, capital, and ideas across borders, it ushered in an extraordinary era of global prosperity: a span of roughly 25 years when the incomes of the poorest nations, on average, were catching up with those of the wealthiest, and when the world came within striking distance of ending extreme poverty,\u201d he said. But Gill added its global economic prospects provided a \u201csobering assessment\u201d of how the model of international cooperation had been fracturing, pointing to how trade measures designed to restrain cross-border commercial flows were growing at a historic pace. \u201cFour years after the upheavals caused by the pandemic, conflicts, inflation, and monetary tightening, it appears that global economic growth is steadying,\u201d Gill said. \u201cHowever, growth is at lower levels than before 2020. Prospects for the world\u2019s poorest economies are even more worrisome. They face punishing levels of debt service, constricting trade possibilities, and costly climate events. Developing economies will have to find ways to encourage private investment, reduce public debt, and improve education, health, and basic infrastructure.\u201d Gill said the world\u2019s 75 poorest countries, eligible for grants or cheap loans from the bank, would not be able to make the necessary progress without international support."

            "date": "2024-06-12T17:06:16Z",
            "content": "An arrest has been made in connection with the criminal investigation into PPE Medpro, the company that was awarded large government personal protective equipment contracts during the Covid pandemic. In a statement, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said a 46-year-old man had been arrested at his north London home. The man is understood to have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit fraud and of attempting to pervert the course of justice. PPE Medpro secured two contracts worth \u00a3203m to supply PPE in the early months of the pandemic after normal competitive tendering regulations were suspended. The Conservative peer Michelle Mone and her husband, Douglas Barrowman, who have both acknowledged they were involved in the company, have previously been interviewed under caution by NCA investigators. Barrowman is not the person arrested on Wednesday. In media interviews they gave late in 2023, Mone and Barrowman adamantly denied any criminal wrongdoing in relation to PPE Medpro. The NCA said: \u201cA 46-year-old man from Barnet, London, was arrested this morning at his home address as part of an ongoing NCA investigation into suspected criminal offences committed in the procurement of PPE contracts by PPE Medpro. He is currently being interviewed by NCA officers.\u201d PPE Medpro was awarded contracts for the supply of millions of face masks and sterile surgical gowns in May and June 2020, after a first approach by Mone to the Cabinet Office ministers Michael Gove and Theodore Agnew, who were at the time responsible for procurement. The contracts were processed rapidly through the government\u2019s \u201cVIP\u201d high-priority lane, which the government operated for companies that had political connections. Standard procurement rules requiring competition for government contracts were suspended at the onset of the pandemic, due to the urgent need to secure medical supplies. The government published a list of high-priority lane companies in November 2021, in which it named Mone as the person who had referred PPE Medpro. Mone, 52, rose to public prominence through the lingerie company Ultimo, which she founded in Scotland with her first husband, Michael Mone. David Cameron made her his \u201centrepreneurship tsar\u201d in 2015, leading a review into ways of encouraging people from deprived communities to start their own business. He then appointed her to the House of Lords later the same year. Barrowman, 59, is a Scottish businessman based in the Isle of Man, who is the chair and founder of an offshore private wealth management firm on the island, Knox Group. In November 2022, the Guardian revealed that leaked documents produced by HSBC bank showed that Barrowman had been paid at least \u00a365m from the profits of PPE Medpro, and had then transferred \u00a329m into an offshore trust set up for the benefit of Mone and her three adult children. In their media interviews last year, Barrowman confirmed that he had made more than \u00a360m profit, and had transferred money into the trust; the couple said that his children were beneficiaries of the trust as well. In December 2022, Mone announced that she was taking a leave of absence from the House of Lords, meaning she would no longer be an active member in the lawmaking function of the second chamber. A spokesperson said she was doing so \u201cin order to clear her name of the allegations that have been unjustly levelled against her\u201d. For three years \u2013 from the government\u2019s publication of the PPE Medpro contracts in late 2020 until their media interviews last year \u2013 Mone and Barrowman denied via their lawyers, in response to questions from the Guardian, that they were involved in the business of PPE Medpro. In her interview with the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg in December, Mone admitted that she had lied to the media, and said she was sorry for doing so, but pointed out that it was \u201cnot a crime\u201d to do so. The NCA launched its investigation into PPE Medpro in May 2021, then in April 2022 it executed search warrants at Mone and Barrowman\u2019s homes, and at the company\u2019s offices in London and the Isle of Man. The NCA has since then confirmed that it is investigating PPE Medpro, saying in a statement: \u201cThe NCA opened an investigation in May 2021 into suspected criminal offences committed in the procurement of PPE contracts by PPE Medpro.\u201d The Lords commissioner for standards launched an investigation in January 2022 into Mone\u2019s \u201calleged involvement in procuring contracts for PPE Medpro leading to potential breaches\u201d of the code of conduct governing peers\u2019 membership of parliament\u2019s second chamber. The commissioner\u2019s investigation is on hold due to the NCA\u2019s criminal investigation."

            "date": "2024-06-10T04:00:33Z",
            "content": "The Nobel peace laureate and microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus has said that years of fighting what he calls \u201cdirty\u201d politically motivated attacks on his work to alleviate poverty in Bangladesh have made life \u201ctotally miserable\u201d. Yunus told the Guardian he had come under 20 years of pressure from the Bangladeshi government for his work, which is credited with improving the lives of millions of poor people, particularly women. In January, he was sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment, along with three other people, for violating labour laws at Grameen Telecom, the not-for-profit company he founded in 1983. He is now on bail pending an appeal but has been charged with more than 100 other crimes, all of which he denies. \u201cThis thing continues and makes my life miserable,\u201d said Yunus. \u201cI can\u2019t concentrate on anything because I\u2019m busy digging up documents to prove that I didn\u2019t do this, documents to prove that I never did that.\u201d Yunus is credited with pioneering microfinance, a financial service for people locked out of formal banking systems. It allows them to take out small loans to invest in building their own businesses. Piloted in 1976 among a group of women in a Bangladeshi village who were given small loans without needing collateral, by the mid-2000s it was seen as a key tool for ending poverty. Yunus and the Grameen Bank won the Nobel peace prize for the work in 2006. The system\u2019s success in lifting people out of poverty has since been questioned and microfinance has been the subject of several scandals over lenders charging exploitative interest rates. In 2011, Yunus was forced to resign from Grameen after a campaign led by Bangladeshi politicians. Yunus, who was 70 at the time, was deemed too old to run the bank. He maintains the mandatory retirement age of 60 should not have applied to him as the bank was not a government institution. The Bangladeshi government has defended the action against Yunus, and denies that it represents a misuse of the legal system, accusing the economist of having a \u201cvictim mentality\u201d for claiming he was being personally harassed. Last year, more than 100 Nobel laureates signed an open letter calling for the labour law charges to be suspended. Amnesty International said the case was \u201cemblematic of the beleaguered state of human rights in Bangladesh, where the authorities have eroded freedoms and bulldozed critics into submission\u201d. Alongside the January conviction, Yunus has been charged with corruption, tax evasion and money laundering. \u201cThese are all false, ask any Bangladeshi. Anybody will know this is all false, fabricated,\u201d Yunus said. Bangladesh\u2019s prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, has accused the microfinance sector of \u201csucking blood\u201d from the poor, but it was a speech she made in 2022 during the opening of the country\u2019s long-awaited Padma Bridge that particularly concerned Yunus. Hasina accused him of blocking progress on the bridge, which had a $1.2bn (\u00a3940m) World Bank loan cancelled in 2012 over allegations of corruption by Bangladeshi officials. She called for him to be plunged into the river to \u201cteach him a lesson\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous thing we are inviting the people of the country to dunk someone [in the river],\u201d Yunus said. Hasina \u201cpours out her extreme hatred on me\u201d, he added. Yunus won\u2019t be drawn on the reasons for Hasina\u2019s enmity but it has been linked by others to his aborted attempt to launch a political party in 2007. Despite the threat of imprisonment, the 83-year-old has remained in Bangladesh and is still working to eliminate poverty and unemployment. He said other countries had offered to host him but he did not want to leave behind his work or his employees. \u201cThis will be all forgotten, removed, destroyed. I don\u2019t want to see that. \u201cLeave me alone, let me do the thing I want, that I enjoy doing and that people benefit from. It is not for my own interest,\u201d he said. \u201cI enjoy finding out solutions for the problems that we see around us \u2013 global warming, wealth concentration, unemployment, poverty.\u201d Yunus is still committed to microfinance. He believes any problems are due to a lack of regulation that has allowed unscrupulous dealers to operate. When done right, he said, the system could give poor people the freedom to improve their lives by building businesses instead of having to subsist on low-paying jobs. \u201c[With a job] you surrender yourself to somebody else\u2019s wishes for the little money that they give you at the end of the month \u2026 that\u2019s not what human beings are all about. Human beings are not built for serving somebody else. Human beings are very independent, packed with unlimited creative capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cOur institutions have been designed the wrong way. If you have money, you get more money \u2026 but if you have no money, you don\u2019t get any money. So you stay where you are. \u201cWhat microcredit has done is brought that finance at the lowest possible stage \u2026 finance is the oxygen of entrepreneurship. If you connect finance with people, people suddenly become very active, become alive, his mind starts ticking, he starts creating things. He\u2019s looking at the world in a different way.\u201d"

            "content": "\u2018It\u2019s very simple,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cIf travellers go far, on long-haul journeys, they should go for longer.\u201d I\u2019m sitting in a Peruvian mountain village with Bruce Poon Tip, founder of G Adventures, a Canadian travel company with a mission. Below us on a narrow rocky terrace, a group of brightly dressed women in bowler hats are chatting while they work. Some are spinning alpaca wool, others are knitting, and a couple are weaving narrow strips of cloth. \u201cTravellers need to connect with locals,\u201d Bruce continues, \u201cbut they should also bring economic benefits to communities.\u201d I am in South America on a mission myself. I want to see how, or if, tourism can help with the huge challenges of social inequality and the climate crisis. I\u2019m taking Bruce\u2019s advice about travelling for longer to heart: I am going to loop south through Bolivia, then start a 3,000-mile journey down the Amazon to where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean. En route, I want to see how the individual tourist can support worthwhile projects, particularly with Indigenous peoples, and also enjoy a wonderful experience. Across the Andean valley, the mountainside is etched with terraces, like a great human thumbprint on the harsh high-altitude terrain. We are in Ccaccaccollo, a weaving community that is a showcase for the G Adventures method. In 2003, a woman from the village, Francisca, approached Bruce with a grievance. Their menfolk were porters on the nearby Inca Trail, carrying gear for foreign hikers. But no visitors had ever come to their mountainside village. The women were economically sidelined, left at home to dig potatoes, and financially dependent on the men. Francisca takes up the story: \u201cWe had traditional weaving skills so we formed a co-operative, then asked Bruce to bring groups here. We wanted to sell the things we were making.\u201d For Bruce, it was a turning point. He had set up G Adventures in 1990 with the idea that travellers needed help to connect with locals, an ethos that had meant only using local guides. Here was an opportunity to do more. His hiking groups began stopping at the village on their way to the starting point of the four-day Inca Trail. Very quickly this revolutionised the village economy, giving the women cash, and power. It also changed G Adventures, bringing a more interventionist approach through a new foundation, Planeterra, whose sole objective was to help all locals benefit from tourism. Now the Sacred Valley of the Incas is home to several projects: a ceramics workshop, new campsites and hiking routes, plus a spacious, well-designed restaurant that uses agricultural produce and workers from surrounding villages. Everything is owned and run by the communities. Success has brought change, Bruce acknowledges. \u201cWe taught them business and entrepreneurship. They have money now and they spend it.\u201d Bringing travellers closer to locals, it occurs to me, has also brought locals closer to the travellers \u2013 a significant side-effect. Francisca welcomes it: \u201cBefore we had nothing; now I have two daughters at university.\u201d Later that morning, I hear singing from a choir and learn that it\u2019s coming from a Seventh Day Adventist hall. An elderly lady outside the hall tells me: \u201cThey came about 10 years ago. We also have the Mormons nearby, and Los Israelitas too.\u201d The latter are a fast-growing Christian cult who believe God is Peruvian and that Armageddon will be followed by the restoration of a communal Incan agrarian society. It\u2019s a reminder that there are many competing ideas about future development in South America. My next stop in the Sacred Valley is Machu Picchu, arguably the best-known archaeological site in the Americas, and a dizzyingly spectacular one too. The site is well managed, bussing tourists up from the railhead in the town of Aguas Calientes (at the time of writing, about 5,000 a day arrive by train then catch the bus to the site). Each visitor is given an arrival time, the route is precisely controlled, and the exit time is specified. Visits to the two mountain viewpoints cost extra. It\u2019s a fantastic experience, as far as theme parks go. What I do not get is the feeling many visitors are searching for: reaching some lost world outside modern civilisation. Those who walk the Inca Trail, or one of the quieter alternatives, put in old-fashioned physical effort, but at the end of their hike, they enter the site through the same turnstiles and get the same experience. Having seen this, I decide to try something different: a tough hike culminating in a remote mountain \u201clost city\u201d only accessible on foot. Choquequirao is another abandoned Inca site, but in an entire year it sees the same number of visitors that Machu Picchu gets in a day, largely because there is no easy way to get there. I have heard that the walk is harder than the Inca Trail, and the ruins \u201calmost\u201d as spectacular. That weasel word \u201calmost\u201d does cause some misgivings, but I join a small group in Cusco with high hopes. Our guide, Washi, gives us a candid assessment: \u201cYou will be very hot, very cold, very thirsty and very tired. You will walk all day and into the night. It may be the hardest thing you have ever done.\u201d One of our group immediately pulls out. A few miles beyond the town of San Pedro de Cachora, we step out of a minibus into the clouds. A few mules huddle together by a homespun cafe and gatehouse, where we register. Only a handful of names appear before ours in the hefty government ledger; they are hikers already out on the four-day circuit. Our gear is loaded on the mules and off we go, steadily descending through a sparse forest of ceiba trees into the Apur\u00edmac valley, headwaters of the Amazon. Washi and I chat about a subject close to many Peruvian hearts: politics. \u201cIn the 1980s and 90s,\u201d he tells me, \u201cthis area was a stronghold of the Sendero Luminoso [Shining Path].\u201d The Sendero were a Maoist insurgency inspired and led by Abimael Guzm\u00e1n, a left-wing philosophy professor from the Andean town of Ayacucho, who had witnessed China\u2019s cultural revolution. His aims were not so different from those of today\u2019s community tourism and sustainability movement: economic equality and empowerment for all, particularly Indigenous communities. His methods, however, were not those of an ethically minded travel company. Guzm\u00e1n procured automatic weapons and started a guerrilla war. Washi\u2019s family, farmers in the high Andes, were caught up in the conflict. \u201cIf people helped the Sendero, the government soldiers killed them,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if they helped the government, the Sendero killed them. My grandparents fled to Cusco and our lives changed.\u201d As we descend, the temperature increases. There are a couple of campsites in wooded areas, but mostly the vegetation gets drier and harsher. By the time we hit the valley bottom, next to the raging torrent that is the Apur\u00edmac, the heat is almost unbearable. But the river is icy cold, pouring down through this 3,000-metre-deep gorge from glacial origins almost 6,000 metres high. I clamber down to its edge and dip my hands. This is my first touch of Amazon water, nearly 3,000 miles from where my journey will end at Bel\u00e9m in Brazil. Swimming looks impossible. We cross on a swaying suspension bridge, then start a brutal climb up the mountainside, enlivened only by fleeting appearances from hummingbirds. Our group splinters, each alone in our private agony. We reach our campsite at sunset and are astonished to find the local mule-supplied shop sells solar-cooled beer. Miles from any roads, the place is a tranquil haven with superb mountain panoramas. The advantages of this smaller-scale trek are quickly apparent: local communities get direct financial benefit and the visitors are absorbed into their world, which remains essentially unchanged. Plans to build a cable car here and integrate into the mega-buck Inca Trail industry have been shelved, saving the locals, I reckon, from becoming day labourers on their own land. At dawn the next morning we are moving again, pushing along the winding trail to reach the ruins while the light is good. As we emerge on the top, the clouds lift and we are treated to magnificent views. The ruins are not as extensive as those at Machu Picchu, but I am about to discover something that sets it apart. A trail leads down through a fragment of jungle to the head of a flight of ancient terraces. From there, 546 stone steps cascade down the mountain, a miracle of stone engineering. So steep is the drop that each terrace is a mere two or three metres wide. It was here that the last survivors of the Incan empire hid themselves away from the future, growing corn and chillis, hanging on to their way of life, and praying that the brutal reality of the Spanish conquest would never find them. On the walls of the terraces, the Incas created elegant reliefs of llamas in white stone. At the bottom, I find the last terrace overgrown with jungle and the steps disappearing down into the thicket, proof that discoveries are still to be made here. I sit on the steps, alone in the \u201clost city\u201d. There are no voices, no selfies, no one telling me to move along. I lie back and watch a condor soar overhead. The trip was provided by G Adventures, which offers a six-day trek to Choquequirao and Machu Picchu from \u00a3599, including local transport, guides and entry to archaeological sites. Holiday Extras can provide assistance with airport parking, travel insurance, hotels and transfers.

            "date": "2024-06-29T13:00:00Z",
            "content": "A prime mover behind the Shirion Collective, a conspiracy-minded, pro-Israel disinformation network seeking to shape public opinion about the Gaza conflict in the US, Australia and the UK, is a tech entrepreneur named Daniel Linden living in Florida who co-wrote a guidebook for OnlyFans users, the Guardian can reveal. Shirion has harassed pro-Palestinian activists, including many Jews, offered bounties for the identity of pro-Palestinian protesters, spread conspiracy narratives centered on figures like George Soros, and boasted of an AI-surveillance platform but offered few concrete details of how the technology functions. The Guardian investigation used public records and open source materials to corroborate information originally provided by the White Rose Society, an Australian anti-fascist research collective. Linden set up Shirion\u2019s crowdfunding efforts, appears to play a central role in operating the network\u2019s social media accounts, and coordinates the group\u2019s efforts on a Telegram channel. Public records and online materials indicate he lives in Gainesville, Florida, but he has also had recent stints in Durango, Colorado, and Medellin, Colombia. The Guardian emailed Linden at several addresses associated with him and his business ventures, and attempted to contact him via phone, text, a direct message on Reddit and a post tagging an X account associated with one of his ventures seeking comment on this reporting, but received no response. Heidi Beirich, co-founder and chief strategy officer at the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said of Linden\u2019s Shirion campaigning that his apparent \u201cgrifting\u201d is common among extremists, \u201cbut his ideology seems very confused\u201d. \u201cRegardless,\u201d she added, \u201che is spreading hateful messages.\u201d The revelations shed light on the nature of Shirion, which has been criticized in the US congress and attracted media attention around the world, and its role in pushing back against criticisms of Israel\u2019s conduct in its invasion of Gaza. \u2018Surveillance network\u2019 The Shirion Collective is an online operation that since late 2023 has appeared on platforms including X, Telegram and GoFundMe to coordinate the spread of pro-Israel and anti-Palestinian propaganda, and the harassment of pro-Palestinian protesters in the west. Across its two X bios, Shirion describes itself as a \u201csurveillance collective\u201d and a \u201csurveillance network\u201d that searches for \u201cdigital fingerprints\u201d to \u201caggressively track what the MSM [mainstream media] won\u2019t\u201d and \u201caggressively track and expose antisemitism\u201d. On Telegram, Shirion hosts a private channel with 885 members at the time of reporting. The channel is further divided into rooms for discussion of events in specific territories (like Canada and Latin America), or for coordination of online activity including mass reporting of X accounts. Shirion organized two GoFundMe fundraisers in April and May of 2024. The earlier fundraiser brought in more than $57,000, including an anonymous $10,000 donation, for an operation in which trucks with big-screen monitors showed footage of the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel near universities in various US cities. The move attracted the attention of critics including Representative Ilhan Omar, who spoke out in Congress against Shirion\u2019s screening of the footage to the University of California, Los Angeles protest encampment. Cash for \u2018doxers\u2019 Starting in late 2023 on X, Shirion began offering what it described as \u201cbounties\u201d for the identification of people involved in pro-Palestinian protests whom they characterized as antisemites. A 29 November post on X advertised an \u201cINSIDERS AGAINST ANTISEMITISM\u201d scheme that promised \u201cCASH for GREAT insider information\u201d. An accompanying graphic promoted a variety of bounties that increased with occupational status, ranging from $500 for the identification of a student up to $10,000 for a politician. Shirion asked supporters to \u201cBOOKMARK and SHARE to get the word out\u201d. By 3 December, Shirion was offering a $500 reward, later bumped up to $1,500, for the identity of protesters Shirion claimed were engaged in \u201cgenocidal chanting\u201d. In succeeding months, Shirion has posted dozens of bounty offers and also has claimed to have paid out to people who have allowed them to identify their perceived opponents. As recently as 19 June, it claimed in a post to have paid out $1,000 for the identity of a protester who was the subject of a bounty on 4 June. Hate and disinformation Beyond the bounty program, Shirion voices or boosts Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian hate, while celebrating death and destruction in Gaza, and violence against their supporters in the west. Shirion has repeatedly celebrated the deaths of Palestinians in Gaza, including Palestinian journalists and children. On 27 April, Shirion responded to a video that included images of destruction in Gaza, posting \u201cLove that gaza looks like That now\u201d, adding \u201cFAFO\u201d, an acronym for \u201cfuck around and find out\u201d. Shirion has frequently celebrated police violence directed at pro-Palestinian protesters in the United States. It has also celebrated violence against journalists it characterized as \u201cMarxist\u201d. On 5 May, in a post depicting a vehicular attack on protesters in Denver, Shirion wrote \u201cLIKE &amp; SHARE to make this more common\u201d. Shirion is also fond of conspiracy narratives. In a 19 December reply to another X user, it described a conspiracy theory that \u201cthe left\u201d was \u201cbringing illegals into the US\u201d to bolster pro-Palestinian protests. Despite Shirion\u2019s claims to be an opponent of antisemitism, on Twitter it regularly promotes conspiracy theories that experts regard as being themselves implicitly antisemitic. They include conspiracy narratives about the billionaire Jewish philanthropist George Soros. On May 10, Shirion posted a warning about the \u201cSoros-Backed Tides Foundation\u201d. Beirich, the extremism expert, said that Soros conspiracy theories are \u201calways implicitly linked\u201d with antisemitism. She added that \u201cit\u2019s strange that [Linden] is at once rabidly pro-Israel and also spreads antisemitic conspiracy theories\u201d. Shirion has also shared conspiracy theories about Muslims, including one projecting a Muslim takeover of Europe. Often, Shirion posts outright disinformation. The account captioned images and videos of pro-Palestinian protesters taking a lesson in Haitian martial arts with the claim that they were \u201cPracticing Slaughter Techniques on Jews\u201d. Project Maccabee Shirion often makes grandiose claims about its connections and an AI technology it claims to be using to identify perceived enemies. At various times on X, Shirion has claimed to have contacts in the New York police department and FBI, Israeli intelligence and the London metropolitan police, and to be connected with Republican congressional candidates and pro-Israel academic and commentator Max Abrahms. And since late last year, it has claimed to have developed an AI technology, Project Maccabee, whose goal it has described as \u201cHitting and creating AGI for the PROTECTION and survival of our people\u201d, and \u201cEXPOSING these putrid antisemites\u201d. Shirion has claimed the platform has advanced capabilities. However, Shirion has never made any public demonstration of its operations, nor produced third-party endorsement of its application to surveillance tasks. Nor has it shown that its capabilities for surveillance and identification are vastly superior to amateur open source intelligence investigators. \u2018Dantheprompt\u2019 and Shirion One thread connecting Linden to Shirion comes from Reddit. The subreddit ShirionCollective is moderated by user \u201cDanimde\u201d, whose screen name is \u201cDantheprompt\u201d. The subreddit apparently has no other members. Dantheprompt user profile indicates that the account also moderates 8 other subreddits, and appears to be an enthusiast of generative AI. Most of the subreddits are either have one member or are dominated by posts from \u201cDaninmde\u201d. Besides the Shirion subreddit, all of the subreddits Dantheprompt moderates are concerned with topics related to the use of generative AI tools including large language models (LLMs) and image-generating tools. The subreddits\u2019 titles include \u201cchiefaiofficer\u201d, \u201cSuperPrompters\u201d and \u201cOnlyFansModelAI\u201d. The last subreddit 3 members which features sporadic posts of AI-generated imagery of scantily clad women, all from from the Daninmde account. The profile picture on the Daninmde Reddit account is an exact match for one used on an account of the same name on Multiplex, a discussion forum dedicated to AI entrepreneurship. In a 28 May 23 post to Multiplex, in a thread called \u201cintroduce yourself\u201d, Dantheprompt posted: \u201cHi guys, Dan Linden here\u2026 Been an entrepreneur for the last 12 years doing digital marketing, digital info products, etc.\u201d Further on, the post reads \u201c@dantheprompt \u2013 if you ever want to message me on Twitter\u201d. The \u201cdantheprompt\u201d X account is now locked, but it identifies Dan Linden as the account holder, and the biography reads \u201cCo-founder of Chief AI Officer (CAIO) \u2013 Building AI Powered (SaaS) \u2013 Digital Arts \u2013 Mixed Martial Arts\u201d. The profile photo, while different from the Reddit and Multiplex photos, appears to depict the same person. That photograph connects Linden to a now-deleted X post from Shirion. On 11 April, Shirion posted a screenshot of a Google search, apparently on an iPhone. At the top right, a profile picture from the signed-in Google account was visible. The profile picture was identical to the one Linden uses on Twitter. Another, apparently dormant X account also uses the username daninmde, and its profile photo appears to depict the same person as in Linden\u2019s other social media accounts. That account\u2019s screen name is Dani L, which is one of the ties between Linden and Shirion\u2019s fundraising efforts. Currently, the organizer of each GoFundMe is identified as Dani M. In an early archive of the first fundraiser, however, the organizer is identified as Dani L. As that fundraiser was being set up, though, the name of the organizer was revealed as Daniel Linden. As the names on that fundraiser shifted, the organizer\u2019s location was given as Gainesville, Florida. On the more recent fundraiser, the location is given as Durango, Colorado. Daniel Linden has lived in both cities. Meet Daniel Linden In his introductory post on Multiplex, one of Linden\u2019s lines was that he \u201cBuilt some companies. Wrote some books.\u201d Public records and open source materials indicate that Linden has certainly started many companies, but it\u2019s far less clear that any of his previous companies survived. Colorado company records indicate that Linden incorporated two companies in that state: Linden Services in 2006, and Focus Interactions Ltd in 2013. Each apparently lasted less than a year. In Gainesville, Florida, Linden incorporated a series of companies starting in 2017, including Clickstein LLC, LD Networks LLC and DG Media LLC. Again, all of these companies appear to be defunct. The companies left few traces on the public record. However, a 2020 English-language media report from Medellin, Colombia, indicates that Clickstein was a digital marketing firm \u201cbased on the idea of \u2018Einstein-inspired marketing formulas\u2019\u201d, and that Linden lived in the city for a period. The last captures of Clickstein\u2019s website are from mid-2022. An archived \u201cour team\u201d page does not provide the last names of staff or management, but Dan L is listed as president of the company. A business intelligence site has Linden as \u201cCo-Founder at clickstein.com, bringing experience from previous roles at notyouraverage.marketing, Marketing Bench, Focus Interactions and Cre8tive Ninjas.\u201d In recent years, Linden has displayed a preoccupation with OnlyFans, the platform that allows producers of adult content to monetize their content, that goes beyond his sporadic attempts to synthesize AI models. A 6 December 2022 screenshot of one of his personal Facebook accounts shows an OnlyFans payment notification indicating a net quarterly take of more than $155,000. On Amazon, Linden is credited as co-author of a Spanish-language ebook whose title translates as Master OnlyFans in just 7 days!, and whose blurb promises to show readers techniques to build \u201can account that will give you an average of 2,000 dollars a month\u201d. In 2022, El Pa\u00eds reported that Colombia is second only to Romania in the size of its adult webcam industry. In 2019, Colombian news magazine Semana estimated that there may be 40,000 women working as webcam models in the country. Linden is currently featured on the website chiefaiofficer.com as one of three instructors of a \u201cChief AI Officer Certification Course\u201d priced at $4,995.

            "content": "The world\u2019s consumption of fossil fuels climbed to a record high last year, driving emissions to more than 40 gigatonnes of CO2 for the first time, according to a global energy report. Despite a record rise in the use of renewable energy in 2023, consumption of fossil fuels continued to increase too, an annual review of world energy by the Energy Institute found. Juliet Davenport, the president of the Energy Institute, said the report had revealed \u201canother year of highs in our energy-hungry world\u201d including a record high consumption of fossil fuels, which rose by 1.5% to 505 exajoules. The findings threaten to dash hopes held by climate scientists that 2023 would be recorded as the year in which annual emissions peaked before the global fossil fuel economy begins a terminal decline. The Energy Institute, the global professional body for the energy sector, found that while energy industry emissions may have reached a peak in advanced economies, developing economies are continuing to increase their reliance on coal, gas and oil. Overall, fossil fuels made up 81.5% of the world\u2019s primary energy last year, down only marginally from 82% the year before, according to the report, even as wind and solar farms generated record amounts of clean electricity. The report, authored by consultants at KPMG and Kearney, found that wind and solar power climbed by 13% last year to reach a new record of 4,748 terawatt hours in 2023. But that was not enough to match the world\u2019s growing consumption of primary energy, which rose 2% last year to a record high of 620 exajoules and led to more fossil fuel use. The review found that the world\u2019s appetite for gas remained steady in 2024 while consumption of coal climbed by 1.6% and oil demand rose by 2% to reach 100m barrels a day for the first time. Simon Virley, the UK head of energy and natural resources at KPMG, said: \u201cIn a year where we have seen the contribution of renewables reaching a new record high, ever increasing global energy demand means the share coming from fossil fuels has remained virtually unchanged at just over 80% for yet another year.\u201d Nick Wayth, the Energy Institute\u2019s chief executive, added that the \u201cslow\u201d progress of the energy transition \u201cmasks diverse energy stories playing out across different geographies\u201d. \u201cIn advanced economies, we observe signs of demand for fossil fuels peaking, contrasting with economies in the global south for whom economic development and improvements in quality of life continue to drive fossil growth,\u201d said Wayth. The report found that, in India, fossil fuel consumption climbed by 8% last year, matching the increase in overall energy demand to make up 89% of all energy use. This meant that, for the first time, more coal was used in India than Europe and North America combined, it said. In Europe, fossil fuels fell to below 70% of primary energy use for the first time since the Industrial Revolution, driven by falling demand and the growth of renewable energy. Europe\u2019s demand for gas in particular has continued to tumble since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which caused pipeline gas imports into Europe to collapse. Overall gas demand fell by 7% in 2023, according to the report, after a fall of 13% the previous year."

            "content": "Young people feel more economically insecure, ignored and apathetic than the average voter before the election, amid evidence that they could be fuelling the growth of smaller parties. A strong rejection of the Conservative party among the youngest voters continues to be evident: the latest Opinium poll for the Observer has a 52-point Labour lead among the under-35s. But analysts pointed to economic pessimism and potential apathy that could also spell trouble for Labour in the years ahead. The European elections last week saw young voters help the rise of the far right in countries including France and Germany. While analysts said there is limited evidence Reform UK has picked up substantially more younger voters in the UK \u2013 some polls in the last week had it ahead of, or on a par with, the Tories among 18- to 24-year-olds \u2013 it is the Liberal Democrats and Greens who could stand to benefit if young people ultimately feel uninspired by Keir Starmer\u2019s pitch. \u201cThey tend to be much more pessimistic about the economy than the population overall,\u201d said Keiran Pedley, director of politics at Ipsos. \u201cIn 2023, younger people tended to be as pessimistic about the economy as they were during the pandemic, with young women particularly pessimistic. That has not always been the case. There\u2019s no surprise to anybody that housing is much more of an issue for this group.\u201d The dynamics of an election in which the Tories are trying to shore up their core vote and Labour is going after middle England also has the potential to leave young voters out. \u201cOn average, 43% of our respondents who have a voting intention say that there\u2019s no chance they\u2019re going to change their mind,\u201d said Guy Miscampbell, head of political and social research at Focaldata. \u201cThat\u2019s only 24% for 18- to 24-year-olds, rising to 38% for 25- to 34-year-olds. \u201cIf you\u2019re a young person who\u2019s facing really high rents, tuition fees and a job market with low real-term wage growth, it\u2019s hard to feel that there\u2019s a party representing you \u2026 Overall, 18- to 24-year-olds are fractionally more likely to be supporting non-major parties and slightly less likely to report satisfaction when voting or [about] the idea of voting.\u201d If they are put off by Starmer, Pedley said that the Greens could benefit. \u201cIf you look at Green voters generally, they do tend to be younger than the population as a whole,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also tend to be very dissatisfied with Keir Starmer, which separates them from Liberal Democrat voters, who tend to be net neutral on Starmer.\u201d In Luton, a town with one of the youngest populations outside areas dominated by a university, there was evidence of both anger at the Tories and a lack of enthusiasm for Labour. Patryk Kuna recently turned 18 and is still undecided on who his vote will go to. \u201cLabour has been making some pretty funny TikToks, so I might vote for Labour, maybe,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t like the guy [Rishi Sunak] in general. No one picked him for office so why is he there?\u201d Distrust of the Conservatives was echoed by 18-year-old Izzy Cowell, though she will vote Green, not Labour. \u201cI don\u2019t want to vote for Labour,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s another way to change things and not rely on a two-party system. I used to resonate with [Labour] quite a bit, but I wouldn\u2019t say that any more. I no longer agree with their leader or what they currently stand for.\u201d Nashe, a 23-year-old hospitality worker, voted Labour in 2019, but will not vote for the party this time. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in Palestine and the reactions from politicians has impacted my decision to not vote for Labour again,\u201d she said. A 25-year-old NHS worker, who chose to remain anonymous, said she is not voting this year and has a lot of distrust towards all parties and politicians. She is one of many young people in Luton who are apathetic about the forthcoming election. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of young people like me who don\u2019t give a shit because our vote doesn\u2019t count and it\u2019s all about what the old people think,\u201d she said. However, Bruno Rebelo, 24, wants to fight against the unwillingness to vote demonstrated by other young people. He said: \u201cI think voting sometimes isn\u2019t about making a difference but is about sending a message. It\u2019s all about numbers, so if people in power see that change is wanted through voting numbers, then something might come out of that.\u201d In a sign that their attention might be elsewhere, parties have not figured out how to make use of new routes to younger voters such as TikTok, according to Dr Stephanie Luke, a researcher for the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank. \u201cThere\u2019s different strategies with TikTok and I don\u2019t think necessarily any political party has really got the ability to use it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first post for the Tories was Rishi Sunak\u2019s announcement on national service. Doing the same content on TikTok as Twitter [now X] is not a good strategy. It requires tailor-made content. Labour is currently top for followers, but it is not increasing substantially.\u201d There are attempts to engage the young. Green energy tycoon and Labour donor Dale Vince has been funding a campaign to boost turnout that claims people who vote are seen as more attractive. He said he was inspired by new voter ID rules that he feared would hit young people more: \u201cThe voter ID laws do focus on younger people and make it harder for them than it is for older people.You can use an old person\u2019s bus pass as proof, but you can\u2019t use a young person\u2019s student card.\u201d"

            "content": "Rishi Sunak must be cursing the British weather. He got soaked to the skin when announcing the general election outside 10 Downing Street last month. Now it appears wet weather has brought a halt to the UK\u2019s economic recovery. Statisticians always caution against reading too much into a single month\u2019s figures and on a quarterly basis things don\u2019t look too bad for the prime minister. Indeed, the economy expanded by 0.7% in the three months to April, compared with 0.6% in the quarter ending in March. But during an election campaign each piece of economic data takes on heightened importance and Labour was quick to exploit the fact that there was zero growth in April. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said it exposed the damage caused by 14 years of \u201cConservative chaos\u201d. In truth, it looks as if Reeves will inherit an economy in a slightly better state that she might have imagined a few months ago. The economy is out of recession and inflation is expected to be back to the government\u2019s 2% target when the May figures are released next week. What\u2019s more, the economy would have grown in April had it not been for a 1.7% drop in construction output and a 2% fall in retail activity. Both declines were almost certainly weather-related. That\u2019s not to say the economy would have exactly been booming had April not been so cold and wet. Manufacturing output, which is not affected by the weather, fell by 1.7%. Sunak really can\u2019t catch a break. The latest growth figures are not strong enough for him to boast about on the campaign trail but not weak enough to persuade the Bank of England to cut interest rates next week. Threadneedle Street is expecting growth in the second quarter to be just 0.2% but that looks overly pessimistic. It would only take monthly growth of 0.1% in both May and June for the economy to expand by 0.4% in the second quarter. Unless something truly unexpected happens in the next three weeks, Reeves will be installed in the Treasury by the time borrowing costs start to come down."

            "content": "A new era of protectionism is leading to slower global growth and hindering attempts to eradicate poverty, the World Bank has warned. The Washington-based institution said 80% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 more than 6 billion people \u2013 were living in countries where growth would be slower in the next three years than in the pre-Covid decade. In its half-yearly global economic prospects, the World Bank said the model of international cooperation that had allowed the poorest countries to close the gap with the wealthiest had fractured. Even though the global economy had avoided recession, it had stabilised at a lower level than in the years leading up to the start of the pandemic. Indermit Gill, the World Bank\u2019s chief economist, said policymakers had cause to celebrate a \u201csoft landing\u201d despite the steepest rise in global interest rates since the 1980s. \u201cBut they would be wise to keep their eye on the ball: growth rates remain too slow for progress. Without stronger international cooperation and a concerted push for policies that advance shared prosperity, the world could become stuck in the slow lane.\u201d The bank\u2019s forecasts show global growth holding steady at 2.6% in 2024 before edging up to an average of 2.7% in 2025-26. In the pre-Covid decade, growth averaged 3.1%. Gill said progress towards prosperity occurred when governments put in place policies that fostered productivity, entrepreneurship and innovation \u2013 and when they did so while cooperating. \u201cThat was the model that flourished after the fall of the Berlin Wall. By encouraging the flow of goods, capital, and ideas across borders, it ushered in an extraordinary era of global prosperity: a span of roughly 25 years when the incomes of the poorest nations, on average, were catching up with those of the wealthiest, and when the world came within striking distance of ending extreme poverty,\u201d he said. But Gill added its global economic prospects provided a \u201csobering assessment\u201d of how the model of international cooperation had been fracturing, pointing to how trade measures designed to restrain cross-border commercial flows were growing at a historic pace. \u201cFour years after the upheavals caused by the pandemic, conflicts, inflation, and monetary tightening, it appears that global economic growth is steadying,\u201d Gill said. \u201cHowever, growth is at lower levels than before 2020. Prospects for the world\u2019s poorest economies are even more worrisome. They face punishing levels of debt service, constricting trade possibilities, and costly climate events. Developing economies will have to find ways to encourage private investment, reduce public debt, and improve education, health, and basic infrastructure.\u201d Gill said the world\u2019s 75 poorest countries, eligible for grants or cheap loans from the bank, would not be able to make the necessary progress without international support."

            "content": "The European Central Bank has eased the pressure on borrowers across the eurozone after cutting its main interest rate for the first time in almost five years. Citing a sustained fall in inflation, the ECB said its deposit rate would be cut to 3.75% from a record high of 4%, putting it ahead of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which have yet to cut interest rates. Financial markets eagerly anticipated the first eurozone cut since September 2019, which will also affect the ECB\u2019s main refinancing operations rate, which fell from 4.5% to 4.25%. City analysts had forecast the reduction in borrowing costs at the ECB\u2019s June meeting after signals that the central bank was ready to offer more support to eurozone economies after a period of economic stagnation following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In a statement, the ECB said: \u201cKeeping interest rates high for nine months has helped push down inflation. It is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction.\u201d The ECB president, Christine Lagarde, said the central bank was confident that its forecasts were robust and if inflation continued its longer term downward trajectory, interest rates would continue to fall. She said: \u201cIt is on the basis of the reliability, solidity, robustness and strength of our projections that we have made the decision to cut.\u201d Lagarde said pay settlements were moderating and companies were absorbing some of the increase in labour costs rather than passing them on to consumers, dampening inflationary pressures. However, she added that there were still risks to the outlook for inflation, saying: \u201cDespite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year.\u201d Dean Turner, the chief eurozone economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said the outlook for inflation, as indicated by the ECB\u2019s latest projections, point to further interest rate reductions later this year. Turner said: \u201cOf course, the timing of the next move from the ECB is uncertain, as this will be dependent upon incoming data. But with the disinflationary process firmly under way, the ECB, along with other central banks, should feel confident enough to ease policy, most likely at a pace of one cut per quarter.\u201d However, the ECB expects inflation to be marginally higher this year and in 2025 than it was forecasting in March. It said inflation would average 2.5% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, up from its previous forecast of 2.3% and 2%, respectively. Mark Wall, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank, said the higher than previously forecast inflation numbers would make ECB policymakers more circumspect about futures cuts. Financial markets expect just one further reduction this year and three next year, knocking a further one percentage point off eurozone interest rates by the end of 2025. Wall said: \u201cThe statement arguably gave less guidance than might have been expected on what comes next. In that sense, the immediate tone is a \u2018hawkish cut\u2019. This is not a central bank in a rush to ease policy.\u201d Strains with the eurozone are expected to show as economies recover from the pandemic and initial impact of the Ukraine war at different speeds. Croatia, which recently joined the euro, and Romania are among countries that are expected to grow by more than 3% this year, according to the European Commission, with inflation running at 3.5% and 5.9% respectively. Projections by the commission show the economies of France and the Netherlands will expand by less than 1% this year with an inflation rate of 2.5% in both countries. Lagarde said the ECB was aware of the variations across the currency bloc, but it was the central bank\u2019s job to set interest rates based on average rates of growth and inflation. Economic growth across the eurozone is expected to improve after better-than-expected performances in Germany, Italy and Spain. The average growth rate for the eurozone would be 0.9% in 2024, 1.4% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026, the ECB said."

The return of a headline consumer price index with a four in front of it for the first time since November \u2013 when the RBA last raised the cash rate \u2013 certainly stirred markets, the media and those in Canberra. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup There is now a better than one-in-three chance of a 14th rate rise when the bank\u2019s board meets on 5-6 August, investors bet. Those hoping for certain relief in the form of a rate cut will have to peer well over the horizon towards November 2025. An early federal election called on the premise of falling mortgage costs, in other words, seems ruled out for now. In Sydney on Thursday night, the new RBA deputy governor, Andrew Hauser, will be pressed at the Citi A50 Australian Economic Forum over what he makes of the May inflation figures and whether the central bank board will lock in a rate increase when it next meets on 5-6 August. (Spoiler: he will do his best to not rule anything in or out.) To the cause for hope. Excitable punters and headline writers aside, the reality is the RBA has said all along it would be following the data. When it comes to inflation, the governor, Michele Bullock, has said she pays attention to the quarterly numbers and those won\u2019t land until 31 July. What we do know is that the central bank forecasts for the June quarter already anticipate some acceleration in annual headline inflation from 3.6% in the first three months of 2024 to 3.8% in the April\u2013June period. Taking into account we had 3.6% in April and 4% for May, technically we are still on that 3.8% course. The inflation bulls, for now at least, have grounds to claim validation. The trimmed mean inflation measure that the RBA generally cares most about did indeed tick up to 4.4% in May from 4.1% in April \u2013 hardly the trajectory to get back to a 2-3% target. The NAB promptly became the most pessimistic of the big four banks, pushing back their expectations for a rate cut from November this year until May 2025 \u2013 the last possible month the next federal election could take place. \u201cThe mix of slow growth and gradual progress on inflation reflects the RBA\u2019s decision to embrace a \u2018lower for longer\u2019 approach \u2013 a lower rate peak compared to other advanced economies, resulting in a longer period at that peak,\u201d Alan Oster, NAB\u2019s chief economist, said in a note. \u201cIt is possible the board will change course and raise rates at its August meeting, especially if the [June quarter] print exceeds expectations, but with the labour market easing we don\u2019t believe their hand will be forced.\u201d ANZ moved a fortnight ago to predict the first cut wouldn\u2019t be until February, while the Commonwealth Bank and Westpac are sticking for now with their November 2024 rate cut calls. Luci Ellis, formerly the RBA\u2019s chief economist who took over as Westpac\u2019s top economist just before the last rate rise, said that her bank \u201calways\u201d had its predictions under review. Ellis sees no need to shift Westpac\u2019s forecasts just yet \u2013 not least because her team correctly picked the 4% May inflation result, compared with the market\u2019s consensus view of 3.8%. What is key, though, is \u201cwhether or not the RBA [was] surprised by the number\u201d, she said, adding that Hauser\u2019s response to questions tonight may be revealing. And as Westpac noted on Thursday, \u201cthe monthly indicator only includes price updates for around 60% of the inflation basket and should be interpreted with caution\u201d. John Hawkins, a senior lecturer at the University of Canberra and formerly of both the Treasury and the RBA, also thinks people may be reading too much into the May data. \u201cThe CPI actually fell slightly in the month,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cThe annual rate only jumped as there was a big fall last May\u201d when the rate fell to 5.6% from April\u2019s 6.8% pace. Unless month-on-month prices rise by more than 0.6% in the current month, the annual percentage growth should return to a decline, he said. A 0.3% rise, for instance, would translate into a 3.7% quarterly pace or less than the RBA expects. \u201cI don\u2019t think [Wednesday\u2019s 4%] number will force the [RBA] to increase rates,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cBut it won\u2019t do much to ease their concerns that inflation is not coming down that rapidly.\u201d \u201cThe path to an interest rate cut remains narrow but it is still there.\u201d"

Until Monday, the ANZ was in line with CBA, NAB and Westpac in forecasting that a cut would land this November. \u201cThe stronger-than-expected [March quarter inflation reading] makes it hard to see the RBA being sufficiently confident that inflation will return to and stay in the band by the time the November meeting comes around,\u201d said Adam Boyton, ANZ\u2019s head of Australian economics. The RBA board will meet early next week, with investors not expecting any change in the RBA\u2019s 4.35% cash rate, that now sits at the highest since late 2011. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Australian Bureau of Statistics will release May labour market figures on Thursday, giving the central bank a key data release to consider. CBA estimates the economy added 30,000 jobs last month, enough to keep the jobless rate at 4.1%. \u201cLeading indicators of employment and the labour market more generally such as GDP growth, job ads and private sector surveys suggest conditions will continue to loosen this year,\u201d CBA said. NAB\u2019s monthly business survey, also released on Monday, found the \u201csubdued economic activity\u201d at the start of 2024 had extended into the current June quarter. Business confidence had turned negative and business conditions were just below the long-run average. Consumer-facing sectors such as retail and personal services were among the weakest both in terms of conditions and forward orders, NAB said. \u201cDespite the softening in activity, capacity utilisation remains above average, which suggests the process of bringing supply and demand back into balance remains incomplete,\u201d Alan Oster, NAB\u2019s chief economist said. Oster said there were \u201creasons to be very wary about the inflation outlook\u201d. The NAB survey found labour cost growth quickened to 2.3% in the past three months from 1.5% in April. Purchase costs and product prices also both increased at a faster pace. \u201cWe have been wary for some time that the path of inflation from here is likely to be gradual and uneven, and the survey results really reinforce this message,\u201d he said. One bright spot in the business survey was an improvement in the employment index for the month, lifting it back above average. The labour market \u201cremains a point of strength for the economy\u201d, Oster said. Another bright spot has been car sales. In first five months of 2024, vehicles sales were up 12% from a year earlier to 512,753, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries said. Sales in May alone set a record for a second year in a row. In a separate release on Monday, the Council of Australian Financial Regulators said in its quarterly update that financial hardship applications and the portion of borrowers falling behind on mortgage payments continued to rise \u201cbut from a low level\u201d. The council groups the Reserve Bank, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and federal treasury. The Australian Financial Security Authority told the council insolvencies for individuals and companies, particularly small and medium sized enterprises, had risen over the past year. \u201cThis followed a period where insolvencies had been well below usual levels reflecting the significant support measures put in place during the pandemic, including those from the ATO,\u201d AFSA said."

            "date": "2024-06-16T11:23:43Z",
            "content": "As the weeks roll by, Rishi Sunak\u2019s decision to call the election before he needed to appears ever more curious. Unemployment is up and growth has stalled. NHS waiting lists have increased. There will be better news from this week\u2019s annual inflation figures but it won\u2019t make a difference to voting intentions. The case for holding on until the autumn was that it would give time for the Bank of England to start cutting interest rates and for recovery to become more firmly embedded. That case now looks all the stronger. Threadneedle Street is not going to deliver a pre-election cut in interest rates this week and by the time it does start to reduce the cost of borrowing, the Conservatives will be long gone. Likewise, when the growth figures for the second quarter come out in August they are likely to show solid \u2013 if unspectacular growth \u2013 of about 0.4-0.5%. After the 0.6% growth in the first quarter, it would have made Sunak\u2019s argument that the economy has turned a corner that much stronger. In truth, though, waiting until the autumn would have only delayed the inevitable. As the election for the European parliament clearly showed, there is a big anti-incumbency factor at play. That was evident in Germany, where all three members of the ruling coalition polled badly. It was evident in France, where Emmanuel Macron has taken the gamble of calling a snap election after Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally won 32% of the European parliament votes. And it will be evident in the UK on 4 July, when voters will kick out the party that has been in power for the past 14 years. There is no little irony in post-Brexit Britain being on the point of electing a soft-left Labour government when large chunks of the EU have lurched to the right. Indeed, the notion that life on the other side of the Channel is one of progressive rationality looks a bit silly in light of the state of politics in the EU\u2019s three biggest countries: Germany, France and Italy. Wasn\u2019t it Brexit Britain that was supposed to be the cradle for fascism? The truth is that the vote against the status quo in the UK in 2016 and the vote against the political establishment in the EU elections last week had the same roots: inequality, nugatory growth in living standards, unhappiness about high levels of migration, and a growing realisation that the parties of the centre-left and centre-right were in hock to a liberal economic orthodoxy that every now and then shifted power from one party of technocrats to another but offered no prospect of fundamentally changing anything. Now chickens are coming home to roost. The Conservatives in the UK face being reduced to a rump, with Nigel Farage keen to engineer a reverse takeover. It is unsurprising that people in the UK are unhappy with the Conservatives. What is surprising is that it has taken five elections for voters to come to the conclusion that the Tories have no real answers to the problems facing the UK. If Labour proves equally bereft of ideas, the backlash will be brutal and \u2013 notwithstanding Labour\u2019s likely massive parliamentary majority \u2013 not long in coming. The task of boosting productivity, raising living standards and spreading prosperity to all parts of the UK is a formidable one. The Resolution Foundation thinktank says per capita income has grown by just 4.3% in total during the 16 years since the financial crisis, compared with 46% in the 16 years prior to that. Meanwhile, the EU has experienced decades of weak growth and its share of global GDP has fallen from 28% to 17% since 1980. In large part that has been due to the straitjacket imposed by monetary union, but matters have not been helped by strict budgetary controls demanded by Brussels. It is no accident that growth was a lot higher before Europe embarked on its drive for ever closer union. It would be wrong to think that the EU is unique, because pretty much every country in the developed west is experiencing the same swirling discontent. Even the US, a country that has maintained its share of global GDP while the EU has been slipping back, is displaying strong anti-incumbency sentiment. The US has plenty of things going for it. It controls the world\u2019s main reserve currency. It is more willing to take risks with economic policy. It has the world\u2019s biggest and fastest-growing companies. It has recovered much more quickly from the Covid-19 pandemic than other western nations, and it was less affected than Europe by the cost of living crisis. Joe Biden should really be comfortably ahead of Donald Trump in the race to win this year\u2019s presidential race. The US has come closest to find a new growth model to replace the one that seriously malfunctioned during the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008. To his credit, Biden has been prepared to break with orthodox thinking by running big budget deficits, investing heavily in a green industrial strategy and by slapping tariffs on Chinese imports. It has been clear since the GFC that something has gone wrong with western capitalism and that a different approach is required. The past decade and a half have been marked by weak investment, modest growth in living standards, attempts to prune welfare bills and large migration flows. The rise of populist parties is a direct consequence of these trends and of the failure of mainstream political parties to respond to them. Social democratic parties came about to protect working people from insecurity. All too often, they have been missing in action."

            "date": "2024-06-11T08:54:12Z",
            "content": "Private sector employers have cancelled job adverts and shed workers at a steady rate over the last year. According to the latest labour market data covering the three months to the end of April, the number of workers in the manufacturing sector was down from the same month last year. Likewise, retail sector employers have cut jobs, along with the hospitality sector. Perhaps surprisingly, given all the cyber-attacks on UK organisations and the demand for digital workers, the number of IT workers was lower in April than a year ago. Without an increase in the number of people employed across the health service and in education and public administration, the unemployment rate would have jumped by even more than it did. Across all sectors, the number of people unemployed rose by 138,000, taking the total to a little more than 1.5 million and lifting the unemployment rate to 4.4% from 4.3% in March. The data also shows that companies are cutting back on hiring, with the number of vacancies in March to May 2024 falling by 12,000 to 904,000. For the political parties campaigning in the general election, this data shows on the one hand that Rishi Sunak\u2019s administration has put money into prominent areas of the public sector to increase staffing levels. There were 170,000 more health and social care workers in April than a year ago and 70,000 more people working in the education sector. On the other hand, almost every private sector industry cut back on the size of its workforce, indicating that businesses are looking, in some cases, to survive a period of slow growth, while others reduce staff to be more productive and improve their margins. The worst-affected private sector industry was hospitality and hotels, which the Office for National Statistics said has shed almost 80,000 workers in the last year. It is not hard to see why hotel managers would be hoping to be more efficient with the way they employ staff. The sector was at the top of the pay table in April, adding almost 10% to staff wages since last year. While most of this rise can be attributed to the increase in the minimum wage, it illustrates the pressure on businesses when forecasts for the economy show growth staying below 1% this year and not much above that figure next year. The Bank of England will be concerned that wages are still rising at an average level of about 6%. While most analysts expect that figures to slide during the rest of the year as the minimum wage rise begin to have less effect, central bank policymakers will want to delay the first interest rate cut since 2020 until they begin to see it happen. One thing the bank cannot know is how many businesses that pay above the minimum level will need to follow suit. The supermarkets have all increased pay at rates above inflation to stop workers defecting to industries that are catching up in the salary race. If this trend becomes widespread, if only temporary, there will be no cut in the cost of borrowing until August at the earliest, and possibly not until November."

AI Steve is a nominee on the list of candidates for the 4 July general election in Brighton Pavilion, last held by the Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas, who is stepping down.

Endacott, 59, describes himself as a \u201ccapitalist with a socialist conscience\u201d. \u201cSteve comes from a working-class background, with a mother who worked in Tesco and a father who unloaded ships in Sheppey docks. \u201cHe understands the value of money and greatly appreciates that the success of his business exploits has left him relatively wealthy and able to enter politics without needing the financial rewards some others seek.\u201d On the environment, he says: \u201cSteve is deeply concerned about global warming but hesitates to join the Green party as he is focused on implementing practical and affordable green policies.\u201d Endacott\u2019s party \u2013 Smarter UK \u2013 was not registered in time for the election so AI Steve will stand as an independent. Endacott unsuccessfully stood for the Conservatives in a local election in Rochdale in 2022 in the ward of Milnrow &amp; Newhey. He received 487 votes. Other candidates in Brighton Pavilion include Si\u00e2n Berry for the Greens, Tom Gray for Labour, Ashley Ridley for the Liberal Democrats and Sarah Webster for the Conservatives.

            "content": "More than two-thirds of voters support raising the age limit for social media from 13 to 16, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The poll of 1,160 voters, released on Tuesday, finds an increasing appetite for government regulation of hate speech, social media and artificial intelligence. Peter Dutton slipped back into negative territory, with 42% of respondents disapproving of the job he was doing as opposition leader and 41% approving. Anthony Albanese is steady with 47% disapproving of his job as prime minister and 43% approving. The poll found more than two-thirds (69%) wanted the age limit on social media to be raised from 13 to 16 years, with 44% strongly supporting the idea and 24% \u201csomewhat\u201d supporting it. Just 14% oppose the idea, and 17% neither support nor oppose it. Almost half (47%) of respondents said technology companies including Meta, Google and TikTok had been \u201cmostly negative\u201d for young people, compared with 19% \u201cmostly positive\u201d and 34% neutral. The Albanese government is currently testing technology for age verification. Dutton had promised to extend the trial from pornography to social platforms, but communications minister Michelle Rowland has confirmed both are already included in the trial. Labor premiers are attracted to social media age limits, with South Australia\u2019s Peter Malinauskas looking to legislate a limit of 14 and New South Wales\u2019 Chris Minns supporting an age limit of 16. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Respondents were asked to select what age on a scale between 10 and 18 children should be able to do a range of activities. On average, respondents thought children aged about 17-and-a-half should be able to buy and consume alcohol, vote in elections and access pornography. On average, 15.4 was the age at which children were thought ready to use social media; 14.3 was the age for children being held responsible for a crime. Respondents were told \u201cthe government is currently developing new laws to protect people from hate speech\u201d which \u201cwould make it a criminal offence to vilify someone based on their sex, sexuality, gender, race or religion\u201d. A total of 62% said they would support the proposal, either strongly (34%) or somewhat (28%). Just 17% opposed it, while about one in five (21%) were unsure. The hate speech bill is expected to be introduced in August alongside laws banning doxing, the online exposure of a person\u2019s private information without their consent. It has already proved a major flashpoint between Labor and the Coalition, with Dutton labelling the laws a \u201ctrap\u201d and \u201cwedge\u201d. A majority of respondents said they wanted to see safeguards for artificial intelligence including that: \u201cbusinesses that introduce AI should have a legal duty to ensure that it is used safely\u201d (78% agreed); \u201cworkers should be involved in designing how AI technology is introduced in their workplace\u201d (62%); and \u201cworkers should be compensated when their work is used to train AI\u201d (60%). But respondents were less fearful of AI, with the proportion saying it \u201ccarries more risk than opportunity\u201d at 42%, down three points from January. The proportion who said it carried \u201cmore opportunity than risk\u201d was steady at 21%. Those who said risk and opportunity \u201care about the same\u201d was up three points to 37%. After the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, promised to introduce compulsory national service for 18-year-olds, respondents were told the plan \u201ccould include unpaid volunteer work one weekend a month doing community service\u201d or a \u201cpaid full-time military placement\u201d. Half (51%) of respondents said they approved of \u201cmandatory national service\u201d in the form of full-time paid military service, compared with a quarter (25%) who opposed it. Unpaid volunteer work was less popular, with 46% in favour and 26% opposed. Almost half (49%) of respondents said Australia was heading down the wrong track, down a point from when the question was asked in April, compared with about a third (34%) saying it was heading in the right direction, up a point. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 June 2024. A previous version referred to full-time military service when the figures related to unpaid volunteer work."

            "content": "Elon Musk has moved to dismiss his lawsuit accusing ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman of abandoning the startup\u2019s original mission of developing artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity. Musk launched the suit against Altman in February, and the case had been slowly working its way through the California court system. There was no indication until Tuesday that Musk planned to drop the suit; only a month ago, his lawyers filed a challenge that forced the judge hearing the case to remove himself. Musk\u2019s request for a dismissal contained no reason behind the decision. A San Francisco superior court judge was scheduled on Wednesday to hear Altman and OpenAI\u2019s argument for throwing the case out. The dismissal is an abrupt end to a legal battle between two of the tech world\u2019s most powerful men. Musk and Altman co-founded OpenAI in 2015, but Musk left the board three years later during a struggle over control of the company and its direction. As Altman\u2019s star has risen in recent years, the two have become increasingly hostile to each other. Musk\u2019s suit revolved around his claim that Altman and OpenAI breached what he referred to as the company\u2019s \u201cfounding agreement\u201d to work for the betterment of humanity. He alleged that OpenAI\u2019s pivot to become a largely for-profit entity that partnered with Microsoft and did not share its technology with the public constituted a breach of that agreement. OpenAI and Altman vehemently denied any wrongdoing, stating that there was no such \u201cfounding agreement\u201d and releasing messages that appeared to show Musk supported becoming a for-profit company. OpenAI and Altman also posted a blog in March that essentially accused Musk of professional jealousy, saying \u201cwe\u2019re sad that it\u2019s come to this with someone whom we\u2019ve deeply admired\u201d. Musk\u2019s suit drew skepticism from legal experts who argued that certain claims in the filing \u2013 such as that OpenAI had created artificial intelligence on a level that could match human intelligence \u2013 did not hold up to scrutiny."

            "date": "2024-06-03T23:01:08Z",
            "content": "A 91-year-old man who became the first patient in England to have his sight saved by an artificial layer in his cornea has praised the procedure for allowing him to still see his wife. Cecil Farley, from Chobham in Surrey, had problems with his right eye for about 15 years before losing his vision. He required a cornea transplant to save his sight but his previous surgery \u2013 a graft with a human cornea \u2013 failed and doctors warned the next might too. And the shortage of human corneas from deceased donors meant Farley faced a year-long wait. But an NHS first allowed him to bypass the queue: the implantation of an artificial cornea. While still early days for such implants, experts say the approach could eventually become a standard treatment and help drive down the health service\u2019s record waiting list. \u201cI can still see my wife after 63 years of marriage, we can just carry on as normal and live life as fully as we can,\u201d Farley said. \u201cIt makes your life fuller when your eyes work properly \u2013 you don\u2019t realise how debilitating it is until it happens to you.\u201d He said eventually he would like to tackle tasks such as repairing a watch but for now he was content \u201cpottering about\u201d with his wife, Elizabeth, 83. The device, called EndoArt, was created by EyeYon Medical and is the first artificial implant that can replace the inner lining of the cornea \u2013 the clear outer layer at the front of the eyeball. This lining plays an important role in regulating the hydration of the cornea. If it is damaged, whether from injury or disease, it can result in blurred vision and other problems. EndoArt is similar to a contact lens: it is a dome-shaped, foldable, transparent and clear implant that the company says is made of a material designed to stick to the back of the cornea. Once inserted into the eye it can be manoeuvred into position with an air bubble and secured in place with a single stitch. Farley underwent the operation, known as an endothelial keratoplasty, in February, making him one of only 200 recipients of the artificial implant worldwide to date. Thomas Poole, a consultant ophthalmologist at Frimley health NHS foundation trust who carried out the operation, said he and his colleague Hanbin Lee had successfully given four patients artificial corneas in the last two months and initial results had shown an improvement in vision. The implant costs about \u00a31,800, in the same bracket as using a human cornea. \u201cLooking forward to the future, I think this may end up replacing human corneas for certain types of corneal graft patients,\u201d Poole added. \u201cIn maybe 10 or 20 years\u2019 time this may become the norm where we don\u2019t need a human cornea and we can just take one out of the box.\u201d Poole added that Farley was \u201ctechnically a very difficult first patient\u201d. \u201cI was prepared for things to be quite hard, but once the graft was fully attached and started to work, it was it was like \u2018wow, this is really working well,\u2019\u201d he said. Prof Sir Stephen Powis, the NHS England national medical director, welcomed the new approach. \u201cThe use of artificial cornea transplants is an exciting and innovative step forward in eye care, which has the potential to benefit many patients needing treatment to improve or restore their vision,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could provide an additional treatment option for those waiting for donated transplants, and it\u2019s heartwarming to hear of patients like Cecil already benefiting from its use.\u201d NHS Blood and Transplant says that to meet all surgery and research needs, it requires a weekly stock of 350 eyes. Between April 2021 to March 2022 it received on average 88 donations a week. According to the NHSBT transplant activity report 2020-21, as of 31 March 2021, 10% of people had who joined the organ donation register had chosen not to donate their corneas \u2013 something Kyle Bennett, an assistant director for tissue and eye services at NHS Blood and Transplant, said could be down to the emotion and symbolism that people attribute to the eyes."

            "date": "2024-06-06T15:26:58Z",
            "content": "Two far-right Republicans have been appointed to the highly sensitive House of Representatives\u2019 intelligence committee at the direction of Donald Trump, a move likely to antagonise the security establishment. Representatives Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Ronny Jackson of Texas, known for their fierce loyalty to Trump and vocal support of his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election result, were installed by the House speaker, Mike Johnson, ahead of other qualified GOP members and apparently without consulting the body\u2019s chair, Mike Turner. Turner has sought to restore the committee\u2019s bipartisan character following years of bitter party infighting between Republicans and Democrats. The appointments of Perry and Jackson to a committee that helps to shape US foreign policy and oversees intelligence agencies such as the FBI and the CIA has caused consternation on Capitol Hill. It also signals Trump\u2019s hostility to organisations that he has vowed to purge if he is re-elected. Adam Kinzinger, a former Republican congressman who served on the House select committee that investigated the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol, called the move \u201cinsane\u201d on a social media post. The pair were appointed to slots opened up by the resignations from Congress of Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin and Chris Stewart of Utah. Perry, a former chairman of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, was at the forefront of Trump\u2019s efforts to prevent the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election. His endeavours led to his phone being confiscated by the FBI, an organisation he will now have a role in scrutinising. \u201cI look forward to providing not only a fresh perspective, but conducting actual oversight \u2013 not blind obedience to some facets of our Intel Community that all too often abuse their powers, resources, and authority to spy on the American people,\u201d Perry wrote in a pointed statement posted on X. Last December, a federal judge ordered him to hand over 1,600 text messages and emails to the FBI concerning his efforts to keep Trump in office after his election defeat. Jackson, a former White House physician to both Trump and Barack Obama, came to public notice in 2018 when the then Republican president tried to appoint him as secretary of veterans affairs. He withdrew his nomination after allegations of professional misconduct emerged, including accusations of drinking on the job and inappropriate behaviour towards female colleagues. It was also said that he took the prescription-strength sedative, Ambien, while on duty. Jackson denied the allegations and said they were politically motivated. But they were upheld by a scathing Pentagon inspector general\u2019s report that said Jackson \u201cdisparaged, belittled, bullied and humiliated\u201d subordinates. The report resulted in his demotion from the rank of rear-admiral to captain by the US navy, in which he served. While serving as Trump\u2019s White House doctor, he was renowned for his extravagant claims about his patient\u2019s supposedly robust health. A spokesman for Johnson said the speaker \u201chas the utmost confidence in Congressmen Perry and Jackson to capably serve the American people on the intelligence committee\u201d. However, the appointments recall the committee\u2019s stewardship under Devin Nunes, a Trump acolyte who helped to turn into a partisan battleground as he used his position to combat allegations that the former president had won the 2016 presidential election with the help of Russian interference. Nunes was rewarded for his efforts by being given a Medal of Freedom by Trump and is now chief executive of the ex-president\u2019s social media company, Truth Social. Talking to AP, Ira Goldman \u2013 a former Republican congressional aide and counsel to the committee in the 1970s and 1980s \u2013 accused Johnson of \u201cgiving members seats on the committee when, based on the public record, they couldn\u2019t get a security clearance if they came through any other door\u201d."

            "date": "2024-06-28T04:00:12Z",
            "content": "Kaja Kallas will be giving up a lot to return to Europe to succeed Josep Borrell as the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief. Her 18th-century offices at the top of the picturesque old town in Tallinn marry elegance with efficiency, with the neoclassical cabinet chamber capable of projecting business papers on to the wall. Outside there is a balcony on the edge of Toompea hill where Kallas sometimes sits, with glorious views over the town and the Gulf of Finland. But for the last year Kallas has appeared destined to leave the hothouse of Estonian politics, and on Thursday she was approved by EU leaders as the bloc\u2019s next high representative for foreign policy. One of Kallas\u2019s great strengths is the clarity of her values and the apparent absence of doubt with which she translates them into policies. She knows what she thinks and she knows how to say it, and can do so fluently in many languages, including French, English, Finnish, Russian and, of course, Estonian. It is what has made her the first European leader to be put on a Russian wanted list. Not surprisingly, her appointment, a clear statement to Russia, will be seen as a risk by some, especially at a time of discord over Ukraine. The role of high representative is not just about advocacy but healing mediation within the EU, and in this context some argue Kallas\u2019s formidable certitude could become a problem. \u201cIn some situations it is admirable to have somebody that leads from the front, and can be the uncompromising outrider, but the high rep is that \u2013 a representative,\u201d one western diplomat said. High representatives are supposed to meld the conflicting voices of 27 countries into one unifying position, even if that can be fraught and frustrating \u2013 as Borrell has found in his clear desire to be more critical of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. But her defenders say Kallas, a child of coalition politics, is more subtle than her reputation as a hammer of Moscow suggests. She is aware that different histories and geographies drive different countries\u2019 views. She may not be as academic as Borrell, who is in his element in an international relations seminar room, but is a voracious reader of history, counting the professors Timothy Snyder and Timothy Garton Ash as friends. Ukraine may be Europe\u2019s pre-eminent challenge, as the Baltic states know only too well. But Kallas knows she will need to be a 360-degree diplomat able to converse about the Middle East, China, Latin America and Africa. Recently, at a Ukraine peace summit, she argued that Estonia, as a country that had been a victim of colonial oppression, understood some of the global south\u2019s motivations. Coming from a small country with a population of 1.4 million, she says she is instinctively primed to hear all voices around the table. She has not been an advocate of majority voting in EU foreign policy, a switch that might ease the need to accommodate Hungary\u2019s views on Russia, but would, critics say, leave the big countries too dominant. Estonia, having fought hard for its freedom from the Soviet Union and for its voice to be respected in Brussels, has no desire to hand power to European behemoths, she argues. The leader of Estonia\u2019s Reform party since 2018, Kallas was an MP from 2011 to 2014 before being elected to the European parliament, where she specialised in technology and competition law. She returned to the Estonian parliament as Reform\u2019s first female leader before being elected prime minister in 2021. Kallas admits her family history shapes her view of Russia, as it does for many Estonians. During the Soviet June deportation of 1941, Kallas\u2019s mother, Kirsti, aged six months, was deported to Siberia with her mother and grandmother. They were allowed to return to Estonia only 10 years later. Her mother would go on to marry Siim Kallas, who served as Estonian prime minister from 2002 to 2003 and as a European commissioner for a decade to 2014. Kallas was in office for little more than a year when Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The war has gone on to dominate her time in office and has been the making of her global reputation. When others such as Emmanuel Macron argued there was a chance to deter Putin from launching his assault on Kyiv, Kallas, influenced by her reading of history, was convinced that dissuasion was futile. Ever since, along with her fellow Baltic leaders, Poland and the UK, she has argued forcefully that Ukraine does not just need support for as long as it takes, but with whatever it takes. Her argument is that Russia is a revanchist imperial power and to listen to Moscow\u2019s threats, she insists, is to give into the fear. She favours ending sanctions loopholes, more arms, war crimes tribunals, the seizure of Russian assets, banning Russian tourists from the EU: the whole package. Recently she has expanded her concept of the Russian threat to include the use of other disruptive methods including migration, disinformation and sabotage. Above all she warns of the consequences of a loss of European will. \u201cAchieving peace or a ceasefire on Russia\u2019s terms does not mean the suffering will stop. Worse, Putin will always want more and no country in Europe will then be safe,\u201d she told the Guardian in a recent interview. Kallas is not just a rhetorician; she comes up with practical ideas including common debt to persuade arms manufacturers to build factories. But her clearheadedness \u2013 or dogmatism, depending on how you see it \u2013 has come at a price. Kallas is the first to admit she is more popular internationally than at home, and her decision to raise taxes to increase defence spending, anathema to a liberal party, has been a form of political suicide domestically. She can laugh at herself, and she may need much of that gallows humour in the years ahead."

            "title": "For Labour, the Gaza crisis is a foreign policy tightrope in waiting",
            "date": "2024-06-02T12:28:46Z",
            "content": "A snap election, and the certainty that the Gaza crisis will not be resolved by polling day, means Keir Starmer already knows the first foreign policy challenge of his expected premiership. Even if the peace proposal announced by Joe Biden on Friday is accepted by both Israel and Hamas, something a Labour-run Foreign Office would encourage, vast issues remain concerning the future role of Hamas and Iran in Middle Eastern politics, as well as Israel\u2019s conduct in the conflict, and restoration of faith in the universality of international law. Internal party pressure, Starmer\u2019s background as a human rights lawyer and the way in which international law has unexpectedly been thrust centre-stage in the conflict have led Labour to slowly distance itself from its previous broad support for the government approach. How much this will translate into hard policy inside the Foreign Office is contested. The pressures will flow in many ways. Labour Friends of Israel (LFI) released a pamphlet last week approving recognition of a Palestinian state, but only once Israel receives credible security guarantees. By contrast, Na\u2019amod, one of the British Jewish groups opposed to Israel\u2019s occupation of the Palestinian territories, has circulated a checklist of questions parties should answer, including a call for a complete ceasefire and an end to arms exports. A leaked video of the deputy leader, Angela Rayner, talking to Muslim voters last weekend showed a nervousness about expectations. She promised that a Palestinian state would be recognised by a Labour government, but gave no date and said there was \u201cnothing to recognise at the moment \u2013 it is decimated\u201d. She also played down the idea that Labour alone could force Israel to change its course, saying: \u201cIf Labour get into government, we are limited. I will be honest. [President Joe] Biden from the US, who has way more influence, has only got limited influence. Qatar and Saudi Arabia are all working to stop what is happening.\u201d Starmer as prime minister will be determined to show he remains vigilant in stamping out the antisemitism associated with the party under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. He prizes the praise he received recently from Edwin Shuker, the outgoing vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, who said Starmer had performed a miracle in changing the party. At the same time, there will be a new mood at Westminster. The decline in influence of Conservative Friends of Israel, close to Benjamin Netanyahu and the Likud party, and the corresponding rise of LFI, much more critical of Netanyahu, will alter the tone of debate. Labour\u2019s support for Israel has become slowly but increasingly conditional. Starmer and the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, have come a long way since the leader gave a speech in Chatham House on 31 October opposing a ceasefire, but not a humanitarian pause, since it would leave Hamas in a position to mount further attacks. As the adverse international court judgments and the death toll have mounted, Labour has adapted in a perhaps under-reported way. The overarching commitment to the international rule of law born in Starmer\u2019s Doughty Street chambers in the 90s has had consequences. On 20 May, Lammy told MPs: \u201cLabour believes the UK and all parties to the Rome statute have a legal obligation to comply with orders and warrants issued by the [international criminal court]. Democracies that believe in the rule of law must submit themselves to it. \u201cLabour believes that the ICC\u2019s independence must be upheld and respected, and that it is right that the conduct of all parties is addressed by the court. Arrest warrants are not a conviction or a determination of guilt, but they do reflect the evidence and the judgment of the prosecutor about the grounds for individual criminal responsibility.\u201d That means, on the face of it, if warrants are issued, as requested by the ICC prosecutor, and Netanyahu remains prime minister, it would be prudent for him not to visit Britain. The disjuncture between US Congress feting Netanyahu and Labour ministers seeking his arrest would be stark. It also implies Labour will drop the Tory belief that the ICC has no jurisdiction in Palestine. In a Jewish Chronicle interview, Starmer\u2019s only criticism of the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, was over allowing any suggestion of moral equivalence between Hamas and Israel. Equally, Lammy has urged Israel to comply with what he describes as the \u201cbinding orders\u201d of the international court of justice to end its Rafah offensive. Labour says it opposed the military action and that it should lead to the suspension of exports of weapons and components that could be used in the offensive. Asked last week what Israel should do after the Rafah offensive that killed 45 Palestinians, Starmer\u2019s reply \u2013 \u201cstop\u201d \u2013 was effective for its brevity and clarity. But it will be more significant if it implies that, in common with some Foreign Office officials, he no longer shares Netanyahu\u2019s faith in a complete military victory over Hamas, or that one is unattainable at an acceptable price in terms of civilian deaths. The current Foreign Office position is subtly different. It opposes a major military offensive, but does not define this. On 22 March, Labour asked that the Foreign Office legal advice, or a summary of it, be published that apparently still says UK arms exports licences can continue since there is not a clear risk of a serious breach of international humanitarian law. It would be insincere, but hardly unprecedented, for Labour not to publish the advice that it had insisted, in opposition, MPs had a right to see. Although it is probably improper to view the papers of a previous government, civil servants are aware their current advice may be published and the whole haphazard process subject to more sceptical ministerial scrutiny. One possible change Lammy has not taken up is a proposal, first made by his predecessor Emily Thornberry, that an independent body of experts should examine arms export licences. The growing Labour criticisms of Israel\u2019s conduct of the war are separate to any distinct role the party may play in resolving the conflict and securing a two-state solution. Here, Labour will be one voice among many, and its role will largely be set by elections in Israel and the US. But the LFI paper on Palestinian recognition gives clues as to the parameters in which Lammy might operate. The LFI is not quite the force that Conservative Friends of Israel has proved to be, but it reflects liberal Jewish opinion. In its latest pamphlet, it moves on from insisting Palestinian recognition should come only at the end of bilateral talks between Israel and a Palestinian Authority (PA), and says it should come as part of a series of incremental diplomatic compromises. It envisages a reformed PA running a demilitarised Gaza; Hamas would be excluded from PA elections and all candidates would be required to disavow violence; Saudi Arabia-Israel relations would be normalised, and some land in the West Bank would be transferred from joint administration to sole PA control. The LFI argues a PA-led Palestinian state can be sold to sceptical Israelis \u201cas the greatest available hedge against resurgence of Hamas, the path to a regional and economic and security pact, and a defeat for Iran\u201d. Challenging Iran is on Labour\u2019s agenda. It backs proscription of the Revolutionary Guards, something the Foreign Office opposes, fearing it will end diplomatic relations with Tehran. Could Labour actually play a peacemaking role in the Middle East? Probably not. It feels Britain has a lot of reconnecting to do worldwide and Palestine has been a diplomatic Bermuda Triangle for decades. Fewer Gulf leaders scratch their heads asking what London thinks. But Lammy knows the charge of double standards has stuck in the global south, and wants to internationalise law by backing an international anti-corruption court. Labour Together, the thinktank that has tried to invent Starmerism, has argued a Labour Foreign Office could play a distinctive role in conflict resolution, a sort of western version of Qatari mediation. Looking for a niche, Labour might find this attractive. Ultimately, the scope for manoeuvre will depend on the context and whether the duopoly Britain faces is Trump-Netanyahu or something like Biden-Gantz. If it is the former, advocates of the international rule of law know a dark winter awaits."

            "date": "2024-06-26T10:51:54Z",
            "content": "A Hungarian transparency watchdog and independent media outlet say they have been targeted in an investigation designed to intimidate voices critical of the government of Hungary\u2019s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. On Tuesday, Transparency International Hungary, an NGO, and \u00c1tl\u00e1tsz\u00f3, one of the country\u2019s best-known investigative outlets, said they had received formal notification that they were being investigated as organisations that, \u201cusing support from abroad, conduct activities aimed at influencing the will of the voters\u201d. The letters of notification were signed by Hungary\u2019s new sovereignty protection office, a controversial body set up with broad powers to investigate Hungarian citizens active in public life. The creation of the office has fuelled fears that Orb\u00e1n and his ruling Fidesz party \u2013 which have come under criticism over the past 14 years for undermining democratic norms \u2013 are working to put more pressure on civil society and the media. In February, the European Commission announced it was taking the first step in legal action against Hungary over the law that created the office, arguing that it violated the principle of democracy. But news of the body\u2019s first investigations \u2013 coming days before Hungary is due to take over the Council of the EU\u2019s rotating presidency in July \u2013 has deepened concerns among Orb\u00e1n\u2019s critics that the government is doubling down on its efforts to crack down on independent voices. \u201cWe don\u2019t consider this legitimate,\u201d said Tam\u00e1s Bodoky, \u00c1tl\u00e1tsz\u00f3\u2019s executive director, adding the outlet was considering how to respond to the investigation and seeking legal advice. \u201cWe see the whole thing as Russian-style, Putin-recipe action whose goal is to silence critical organisations and at least scare,\u201d he said in a phone interview on Wednesday, calling the sovereignty office\u2019s move \u201cshameful\u201d. Asked why he believed \u00c1tl\u00e1tsz\u00f3 had been targeted, Bodoky pointed to the outlet\u2019s investigations concerning alleged corruption, which he said had made the government and people connected to the ruling party \u201cuncomfortable\u201d. \u201cWe think some stories really hurt them,\u201d he said. As part of its investigation, the sovereignty protection office has sent 62 questions to Transparency International Hungary and 11 questions to \u00c1tl\u00e1tsz\u00f3. In a statement, Transparency International Hungary said it \u201cbelieves that it is no accident that our organisation has been targeted\u201d. \u201cAs a non-governmental organisation fighting corruption, the success of our investigative, analytical and legal work, and perhaps even our mere existence threatens the regime of Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who has been leading the most corrupt government in the European Union,\u201d it said. \u201cWe consider the operation of the office, as well as the law establishing it, to be unconstitutional. Nevertheless, as an NGO thoroughly committed to transparency, we will respond to the questions by the office,\u201d the group added. The organisation has also filed a complaint with Hungary\u2019s constitutional court. The Hungarian government and the sovereignty protection office did not respond to requests for comment. Reached by phone on Wednesday, J\u00f3zsef P\u00e9ter Martin, Transparency International Hungary\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cDemocracy is in decline in Hungary for many, many years. The state organisations are not independent.\u201d"

            "content": "I wanted to draw your, and your readers\u2019, attention to something I think is extremely sharp practice by the insurance broker Collingwood. I bought its annual learner driver policy for my son last year for \u00a3256. Collingwood was clear that once he passed his driving test the policy would cease to be valid, which I understood. In fact, it took my son almost the whole year before he passed, with only a few weeks of the policy left to run. I was content to let it expire, in the knowledge that no partial refund would be due. I was then very surprised to receive an email informing me that, since my son had passed his test, I now owed Collingwood a \u00a340 \u201ccancellation fee\u201d. I knew, in practice, no claim could now be made on it. I had paid the full premium upfront and owed nothing further. Collingwood\u2019s position is that the charge is included in its Ts and Cs, which I ticked when I bought the policy, and so is legitimate. I see from different review websites that many people have been affected by this and are complaining they feel ripped off. I appreciate that cancellation fees may be appropriate when the consumer no longer wants the product, but charging \u00a340 to basically allow a policy to lapse does not seem at all reasonable. ML, by email I couldn\u2019t agree more. The company is, in effect, selling a policy that it expects the vast majority of its buyers will have to cancel before the end of the term, and is failing to explicitly mention this charge upfront. It is likely doing so to make the policy look cheaper than it actually is in web comparisons. In my view, it is a hidden charge \u2013 one, as you say, that is catching out a lot of people. I asked Collingwood about it and it says it was still looking into your complaint, made more than a month ago. \u201cThe fee and conditions of cancellation are clearly presented in the customer journey prior to purchase, and also require an acknowledgment that they have been understood and accepted, before any policy can be purchased,\u201d it said. \u201cWith reference to the amount of the fee charged, this has been set with consideration to fair value and the consumer duty.\u201d If everyone who finds themselves on the wrong end of this \u00a340 charge takes the matter to the Financial Ombudsman, the company will soon put it upfront on its website, which is what it should do anyway. Other potential Collingwood policy buyers take note of this shoddy behaviour. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

            "date": "2024-06-26T11:24:52Z",
            "content": "German climate activists are taking the government to court for \u201cunconstitutional\u201d climate policy, seeking to build on a landmark victory three years ago that they had hoped would force Europe\u2019s biggest polluter to clean up quickly. The activists argue that the new climate law is too weak, that a recent update makes it harder to enforce, and that inaction from the transport ministry, which has repeatedly failed to meet its emissions targets, will force tough measures on poor groups in the future. \u201cOur last win made it clear that we have a right to climate action,\u201d said Luisa Neubauer, a climate activist and leading figure in the Fridays for Future school strike movement. \u201cYet three years later, the government is failing to take necessary action.\u201d Germany, a major carmaker that burns coal for one-quarter of its electricity, is on track to fall just short of its target to pump 65% fewer planet-heating pollutants into the air in 2030 than it did in 1990. Its top court ruled a previous version of its climate law partly unconstitutional in 2021 when Neubauer and other activists won a legal challenge. Chided by the court and admonished by activists, the previous government updated the law to cut emissions faster and include targets for each sector. But this year \u2013 under pressure from the market-liberal Free Democrats party, a minor coalition partner that controls the transport and finance ministries \u2013 the current government scrapped the sectoral targets, watered down requirements for catch-up actions and reduced legal pressure to plan beyond 2030. Liz Hicks, a law researcher at the University of M\u00fcnster, said \u201cconflicting visions\u201d on climate action within the governing coalition had made it harder to enforce the 2021 ruling. \u201cThe [latest] amendment makes it more difficult to implement the targets in the Climate Protection Act, even if they exist on paper.\u201d The previous ruling deemed Germany\u2019s old climate law unconstitutional because it violated \u201cintertemporal freedoms\u201d \u2013 pushing the burden of fast action on to future generations \u2013 but stopped short of saying the government had failed in its obligations so far. Since then, Germany\u2019s scientific watchdogs have repeatedly documented gaps between targets and actions in sectors of the economy such as transport and buildings. The Council of Experts on Climate Change, a body set up by the government after the climate law was first established, said that a transport ministry action plan to make up for its shortcomings in 2022 was too weak to even warrant a formal assessment. The activists argue the government has \u201cwastefully used up the carbon budget\u201d in the three years since the last court ruling. They point to its rejection of cheap policies to cut pollution, such as putting a general speed limit on motorways, as missed opportunities. Maxim B\u00f6nnemann, the editor-in-chief of Verfassungsblog, an academic publication about German constitutional law, said the constitutional complaint was trying to \u201cgive teeth\u201d to the principle of intertemporal freedom. \u201cGermany is unlikely to meet its climate targets for 2030, which means that young people will have to accept significant restrictions on their freedoms in the future if Germany does not make its climate policy more ambitious today.\u201d A spokesperson for the German climate and economy ministry said the federal government was \u201cconvinced\u201d that the amendment to the law in April was constitutional. The spokesperson said it improved the evaluation of climate policy by introducing an annual forecast of emissions reductions, allowing for more reports by the Council of Experts on Climate Change, and required adjustments if targets were missed two years in a row. \u201cIn addition, every new government must adopt a comprehensive climate protection programme within the first 12 months of its term in office,\u201d the spokesperson said. The complaint, brought by Fridays for Future together with other environmental groups including Greenpeace and Germanwatch, also argues that people in rural areas and other socially disadvantaged groups will be hit hardest by tougher measures necessary to make up for a lack of action today. \u201cToday\u2019s inactivity violates fundamental rights,\u201d said Roda Verheyen, a lawyer for the activists. \u201cWe are running into a situation where freedom is just a question of the purse.\u201d The complaint cites the recent victory at the European court of human rights of 2,400 older Swiss women demanding Switzerland do its fair share to stop climate change because their demographic is more likely to die during heatwaves. The court ruled partly in their favour \u2013 finding that the Swiss government had violated their human rights with weak policy \u2013 but Swiss lawmakers rejected the ruling. Neubauer said the situation in Germany was similar to that in many other liberal democracies and hoped that the case would close the gap between rhetoric and action across the board. \u201cIn theory, our governments applaud climate action. In practice, they keep delaying necessary measures to cut emissions \u2013 hence increasing the burden for the future.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-25T16:00:00Z",
            "content": "Not many people seem to feel happy about their financial lives right now. In the US, 63% of Americans cited money as a \u201csignificant stressor\u201d in their lives, according to the American Psychological Association\u2019s 2023 Stress in America report. Among those aged 18 to 34, that number went up to 82%. In the UK, a November 2023 poll found that a third of adults had felt anxious in the past month because of their personal financial situation, and 9% reported feeling \u201chopeless\u201d.cdxnmgh There are concrete reasons for this anxiety. In the US, high inflation has given consumers a grim outlook on the economy, and a cost of living crisis has seized the UK. But there is something else at play, too. For how central money is to our lives, many of us were never explicitly taught about it; some of us were expressly forbidden from discussing it. Instead, we learned about finances by watching how our family and friends handled it. We drew conclusions \u2013 often incomplete \u2013 and then brought those with us into adulthood. Is it any wonder, then, that so many people have a fraught relationship with money? Enter financial therapy. Still a relatively young field, financial therapy was born in 2008 when a small group of therapists and financial experts gathered in Garden Grove, California, to discuss how to bridge their two areas of study. A year later, they formed the Financial Therapy Association (FTA) to help shape and standardize the practice, develop ethical and training requirements, and grow the profession. \u201cMost people don\u2019t initially recognize the connection between their upbringing and beliefs, and what they do with their money,\u201d says Dr Traci Williams, a clinical psychologist and certified financial therapist (CFT). We talked to five CFTs to learn how to build a healthier, happier relationship with money. Know the basics \u201cMany people don\u2019t know how much they make. They don\u2019t know what their actual paycheck is, and what deductions are coming out of it,\u201d Williams says. Take stock of your current financial situation, experts say. At the very least, figure out how much money you bring in each month and how much you spend. And then, be honest about it. Avoiding conversations about money is common, especially with couples, says Lauren Staley, a CFT and marriage and family therapist. If couples don\u2019t discuss financial issues, there\u2019s no route to solving them. There is a sense of \u201cif we don\u2019t talk about it, it will disappear.\u201d Don\u2019t be down on yourself Staley says the financial issue her clients struggle with the most is shame. Many people are aware that there are tools and resources available to help them save more or get out of debt \u2013 like budgeting apps \u2013 but can\u2019t bring themselves to use them, she says. \u201cThat brings a lot of embarrassment and it brings a lot of shame.\u201d Letting go of your shame can help you move forward, she says. In order to do this, though, you have to figure out why you carry so much financial baggage in the first place. \u201cGetting to the root of why you do what you do can help you detach from feelings of \u2018I\u2019m not good enough,\u2019\u201d she explains. Figure out your money script \u2026 Just as people fall into certain patterns in their romantic relationships, they can fall into financial patterns as well. Traditionally, in the field of financial planning, there are four so-called \u201cmoney scripts\u201d people tend to follow that shape their financial behavior, says Bill Nelson, a CFT and certified financial planner: money avoidance, money worship, money vigilance and money status. Money avoiders may try to avoid thinking about money at all costs, while money worshippers may believe financial wealth is the key to happiness. Those with money vigilance may obsessively track every penny in and out, while those with money status may feel their self-worth is inextricably linked to how much they make. Nelson argues that, in reality, there are far more than four money scripts, and that people may fall into multiple different buckets. But in most cases, he says, our personal money scripts are \u201cincomplete or partial truths\u201d that are capable of being changed. \u201cEverybody has these underlying principles that we can uncover with some digging and reflecting. Then the question is: which of those money beliefs are problematic, and which are the ones that are driving the financial outcomes we\u2019re looking to change?\u201d \u2026 And your partner\u2019s money script When couples fight about money, often it is the result of not understanding each other\u2019s \u201cinternal wiring\u201d, says Elana Feinsmith, a CFT and financial coach. \u201cIf one person has a very strong money script that says money is supposed to be spent, and the other has a very strong money script that says money is supposed to be saved, then in every conversation that couple has, those scripts are going to be fighting,\u201d she says. Don\u2019t try to do too much too fast Staley says that she has some clients who, when they want to understand and improve their finances, can sometimes take on too much at once. They make spreadsheets, download personal finance apps, read books and listen to podcasts. While that may be helpful for some people, it can be too much for others. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be that complicated,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can do something simple and take some of the anxiety away and still be very successful.\u201d To start, she often encourages her clients to make a Google spreadsheet of their income and expenses, and to spend five to 10 minutes a day recording the money they have coming in and going out. \u201cI find the commitment to a smaller chunk of time helps folks feel like it\u2019s doable,\u201d she says. Make a realistic plan This can be as small as a weekly or monthly budget, or as big as a five-year plan, says Williams. \u201cOne of the things that I repeat at least once a week in my work is that if you don\u2019t tell your money where to go, it will go where it chooses,\u201d she says. If you\u2019re struggling to figure out what you want to do with your money, Nelson says it can be helpful to reflect on your goals and values. He says he encourages couples he works with to come up with a family mission statement that defines who they are and what\u2019s important to them. For example, is their goal to stay debt-free, or to invest in a growing business? Is traveling a priority, or is it more important to save for their children\u2019s college education? \u201cWhen you have that clarity around who you are and where you\u2019re looking to go, it can make some of the more difficult financial decisions \u2013 particularly the emotional financial decisions \u2013 feel a bit easier,\u201d he says. Stick to it \u2013 but be flexible To paraphrase the famous poem, the best laid financial plans often go awry when, say, your car\u2019s engine stops working, or your dog swallows a toy and needs emergency surgery. One of the biggest challenges with a budget is that expenses vary from month to month, says Kelly Reddy-Heffner, a CFT and financial planner. While surprise costs are unavoidable, Reddy-Heffner says it\u2019s important to try to stick to your budget, even if that means making small tweaks. \u201cYou might not always be able to follow your plan to the letter, but can you go back to it?\u201d she says. \u201cCan you make a minor adjustment? How can you pivot and also continue the good work that you\u2019re motivated to do?\u201d Figure out what money means to you In addition to identifying their financial scripts, Nelson says it\u2019s helpful for people to reflect on their relationship to money. Ask yourself what your first memory is of money, Nelson says. When did you first realize that money was a thing? Nelson says his favorite question to ask is: Why is money important to you? Often, he says, people will either say \u201cfreedom\u201d or \u201csecurity.\u201d But he encourages people to go deeper. What does freedom or security really mean? What does it look like? Get as detailed as possible, he says. Williams says she also encourages her clients to dream. \u201cStop and think about what you would like your life to look like in five years,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you tie your goals to something you actually care about, you\u2019re more motivated to achieve them.\u201d Think about what a healthy relationship with money looks like While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to money, experts agree that a healthy relationship with money is one where you feel like your money is helping you accomplish your goals, but it\u2019s not taking up too much of your brain space. \u201cIt\u2019s using your money as the sail in your sailboat,\u201d says Nelson. It\u2019s not the end destination, nor is it the boat itself, he explains, but it\u2019s a tool to get you where you want to go. \u201cYou want to have a plan for how you\u2019re going to use it \u2013 are you going to let the sail out or take it in?\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-29T06:00:49Z",
            "content": "People who look after family members free of charge are taking a huge hit to their finances which could continue into their retirement as they find themselves unable to balance paid work with their caring commitments. Recent analysis of official figures by the financial firm Just Retirement found seven in 10 people who were receiving carer\u2019s allowance were not in paid work, and missing out on earnings and private pension contributions. Andresearch last year by the charity Carers UK found that 40% of those providing high levels of care for an ill, elderly or disabled relative or friend had left their employment, while 22% had reduced their working hours. \u201cToo often for unpaid carers in work, the immense stresses and challenges of the role with little support can mean having to reduce working hours or come out of the workplace altogether,\u201d says Helen Walker, the chief executive of Carers UK. \u201cThis can have a significant impact on household finances, exacerbated by the current cost of living crisis.\u201d With just days to go until the election, the party that looks most likely to take power has said very little about what it would do to help the UK\u2019s army of unpaid carers. The Labour manifesto does not include a single mention of the word \u201ccarer\u201d. The Conservative manifesto does include a few brief mentions. Only the Liberal Democrats have put forward substantial proposals for better support. Carer\u2019s allowance is now worth \u00a381.90 a week and is available to people who provide at least 35 hours a week of care to a disabled person. Carers UK has been conducting an annual survey for several years, each time asking people about the impact of their role on their finances. Last year, it found 75% of those receiving carer\u2019s allowance were struggling with cost-of-living pressures, with almost half cutting back on essentials including food and heating. The proportion saying that they were struggling to make ends meet had risen to 45%, from 39% in 2022. The survey found that 72% were worried about the financial hit from expenses linked to caring, such as petrol for hospital visits, heating and specific dietary requirements. Those who were employed worked in low-paid jobs as a result of the strict rules around carer\u2019s allowance. An earnings limit means you do not qualify if you earn more than \u00a3151 a week \u2013 after that, you lose the entire benefit. The Guardian has revealed that carers who have inadvertently earned more have been taken to court by the Department for Work and Pensions. Carers UK and Just Retirement say that these rules make it hard for people to stay in paid work. \u201cRemoving unnecessary pressures and ensuring those who can, and want to, remain in paid work is essential,\u201d Walker says. She says the low level of the payments doesn\u2019t recognise what carers do, \u201cand there are clear problems in the way that it\u2019s delivered, making even small amounts of work challenging. Raising the earnings limit is something that would help more carers to stay in paid work and help avoid some devastating overpayments.\u201d Stephen Lowe from Just Retirement says carer\u2019s allowance was never intended to be a \u201cwage\u201d or payment for caring services. \u201cHowever, if the rules are stopping or limiting people from taking up employment and earnings opportunities that are available to them, then we have to question whether it is fit for purpose.\u201d He warns that if people restrict their work or give it up entirely to provide care, \u201cthat loss of income and other work benefits such as employer pension contributions is likely to have an impact on their lives for decades to come, as well as on the businesses who lose key staff.\u201d Among proposals in the party manifestos for next week\u2019s general election are a pledge by the Lib Dems to increase carer\u2019s allowance by \u00a320 a week and to introduce a new earnings taper of \u00a3183, after which carers would start to lose some of their allowance. Labour has previously said it would review the system but included no details in its election pledges. Walker says that without better support for working carers, the problems they face will show no sign of abating. \u201cThe last decade has seen a significant rise in the number of hours of unpaid care being provided and a reduction in social care available,\u201d she says. \u201cOur recent YouGov research revealed that 62% of UK adults \u2013 the equivalent of 10 million current or former unpaid carers \u2013 said they have had no choice about taking on an unpaid caring role.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-18T12:00:19Z",
            "content": "Claire*, 42, was always told: \u201cFollow your dreams and the money will follow.\u201d So that\u2019s what she did. At 24, she opened a retail store with a friend in downtown Ottawa, Canada. She\u2019d managed to save enough from a part-time government job during university to start the business without taking out a loan. For many years, the store did well \u2013 they even opened a second location. Claire started to feel financially secure. \u201cA few years ago I was like, wow, I actually might be able to do this until I retire,\u201d she told me. \u201cI\u2019ll never be rich, but I have a really wonderful work-life balance and I\u2019ll have enough.\u201d But in midlife, she can\u2019t afford to buy a house, and she\u2019s increasingly worried about what retirement would look like, or if it would even be possible. \u201cWas I foolish to think this could work?\u201d she now wonders. She\u2019s one of many millennials who, in their 40s, are panicking about the realities of midlife: financial precarity, housing insecurity, job instability and difficulty saving for the future. It\u2019s a different kind of midlife crisis \u2013 less impulsive sports car purchase and more \u201cwill I ever retire?\u201d In fact, a new survey of 1,000 millennials showed that 81% feel they can\u2019t afford to have a midlife crisis. Our generation is the first to be downwardly mobile, at least in the US, and do less well than our parents financially. What will the next 40 years will look like? Claire was raised by a single mom who worked as a librarian. Even on a single salary, her mom had been able to buy a C$178,000 (US$130,000) house, not far from Ottawa\u2019s downtown core. Shortly after the pandemic, Claire looked at a house nextdoor to her mom, hoping to be closer to her and her business, but the house was listed for over C$800,000. Claire still rents; she has about $75,000 saved up for a downpayment, though she fears that\u2019s \u201cshockingly far from enough.\u201d In Canada, people under 40 have the lowest homeownership rate, hit by soaring home prices and recent interest rate increases. The average home price in Ottawa is just over C$700,000. She has a six-year-old son and sometimes wonders if she should give him a sibling. But she\u2019s concerned about how that would affect the family budget. \u201cTwo kids would make this 1,000 times more stressful,\u201d she says. \u201cTrying to save for two kids\u2019 educations, summer camps for two kids? I feel like I\u2019m barely scraping by with one.\u201d These days, she\u2019s not sure if running her store is sustainable. \u201cIs it supposed to be a hobby for me to do this?\u201d she asks. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a millionaire \u2013 I just want to make like, $70,000 a year. Is that too much to ask?\u201d While Claire is her own boss, others are at the whims of an ever-changing labor landscape, living through layoff after layoff, watching some industries disintegrate over the years. Katie, 43, is a journalist who worked at newspapers and magazines before she went freelance 11 years ago. She\u2019s experienced job precarity her whole career. Her first real byline, she told me, ended up on the front page on her 21st birthday: \u201cCollege Seniors Fear the Job Market.\u201d Indeed, she moved back in with her parents in St Paul, Minnesota after college \u2013 at the time, the journalism job market \u201cwas dismal\u201d, she says. Much like the present, the industry \u201cwas being gutted at an alarming pace and outlets did not have the capacity to hire\u201d. When she finally did land a job, as an editor for a weekly community newspaper in St Paul, she remembers calculating her hourly pay and realized \u201cpeople were making more money in fast food\u201d. Over the next few years, she found steadier work. Then in the financial crash of 2008, like many in her generation, she was laid off, right before her wedding. By the time she was 30, she\u2019d already had to \u201chopscotch to three different jobs\u201d, she says. \u201cThings often felt pretty bleak. Everything that worked out simply felt like a lucky strike.\u201d Though she finally feels more secure in her work opportunities now, she worries about the future; she doesn\u2019t feel optimistic about building wealth, either. Older friends always said things would be easier as she got older, her own cohort feels less optimistic. \u201cWe\u2019re running headlong into a future that is not going to be predictable the way their lives had been,\u201d she says. She knows some might say to change careers if it feels so bleak, but that\u2019s not easy. \u201cThere\u2019s never been anything else I\u2019ve wanted to do or felt suited for,\u201d she says. As for 20 years from now, well: \u201cRetirement feels like a joke,\u201d she says. Of course, not all millennials are feeling this pinch equally. In a study of millennial wealth in the US led by the University of Cambridge, researchers found a significant wealth gap. \u201cThe wealthiest millennials have more wealth than previous generations at the same age, but the poorest millennials have less [than previous generations]\u201d, Rob Gruijters, one of the researchers involved with the study, told me. While the wealthiest millennials are doing fine, Gruijters points out that \u201ca substantial number of millennials remain stuck in precarious careers, with limited economic prospects.\u201d When it comes to family, he says millennials are more likely to stay in the parental home longer, have children later and be \u201csingle at midlife than previous generations\u201d. Like Claire and Katie, I grew up with humble means but managed to get an education and worked in my chosen field not long after graduating. But I\u2019ve always felt like the rug was going to be pulled out from under me. Within the first six months at my first newsroom job, my employer announced massive layoffs. I still remember the knot in the pit of my stomach while I waited to find out if I\u2019d be affected, wondering how I\u2019d pay my rent or afford to live in Toronto, where I\u2019d just moved. I lived in fear until I could confirm my contract job was safe, at least for the time being. I feel exactly the same nearly 20 years later, watching staff jobs and entire outlets disappear. Many of my friends in their mid-30s to early 40s who work in tech, media and finance have also been laid off recently. With precarious gig work and patchy, temporary employment making greater headway in the jobs market, the number of years a person might spend in any one role has fallen. There have been trend pieces about how much millennials are struggling financially and career-wise for 10 or 15 years. It feels like nothing has changed for us. We should be at the peak of our careers and enjoying some security, but many of us are still renting: millennials make up the majority of the renting population, at the mercy of landlords and drastically rising rents. I\u2019m 41. I have three young kids, and when I think about the coming decades I feel a tightness in my chest. What job should I even strive for when so many in my field \u2013 media \u2013 no longer exist? I spend a good chunk of my days researching other careers, but the landscape looks challenging everywhere. I dream of moving to a small town, but that wouldn\u2019t necessarily solve any of my problems, given that the housing crisis has spared not even the farthest of reaches. Katie has three school-age kids and is concerned about what the next 20 years might look like for them too. \u201cWatching what\u2019s happened in their lives and what might be coming for their future has me deeply worried,\u201d she says. I always imagined a midlife crisis was something fanciful. It used to mean taking the opportunity to live out a youthful dream or change up your life because you finally had the means to do so. But millennials\u2019 midlife crisis looks quite different. For Katie it means feeling shorted. \u201cI think a lot of millennials rightfully feel left behind,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have choices they want to make but the reality of the situation is they can\u2019t.\u201d I feel the same \u2013 like the promise of financial security still exists because generations before us had it. In reality, though, it may be entirely out of reach. * Name has been changed"

            "date": "2024-06-30T18:57:59Z",
            "content": "Rising government debt levels could disturb global financial markets, the head of the body that advises central banks said on Sunday before France\u2019s high-stakes parliamentary elections. Agust\u00edn Carstens, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said the world economy was on course for a \u201csmooth landing\u201d from the inflation crisis, but he warned that policymakers, especially politicians, needed to be careful. Global government debt is already at record levels and elections ranging from the US presidential vote in November, to recent polls in Mexico and South Africa, and votes in France and Britain in the coming week, all carry risks. Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to call a snap election in France has sent the country\u2019s bank stocks crashing and alarmed the bond markets, exacerbating fiscal sustainability concerns in the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy. Polls released before the first round of voting on Sunday suggested the far right could win the largest share of the vote, amid record turnout. Carstens said the BIS was not calling out any \u201cone or two\u201d governments but that the message was clear. \u201cThey [governments] must cut short the rise in public debt and accept that interest rates may not return to the pre-pandemic ultra-low levels,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a solid foundation to build upon.\u201d With interest rates not about to go back to ultra-low levels, and cost pressures from ageing populations, climate breakdown and rebuilding defence capabilities, economic stimulus plans and a general rise in protectionism could unsettle sensitive markets, BIS warned as it published its annual report. \u201cThey can surprise you with not much notice,\u201d Carstens told reporters, pointing to the turbulence in Britain\u2019s markets after then prime minister Liz Truss\u2019s budget plans, which put some pension funds at risk of collapse. \u201cYou really want to avoid that.\u201d France\u2019s main parties have all promised new spending. Macron\u2019s government had promised to cut the budget deficit from 5.5% of gross domestic product last year to a European Union ceiling of 3% by 2027 \u2013 an objective that may be unattainable after the vote, which concludes with a second round on 7 July. If it forms a government, Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally (RN) wants to cut value-added tax (VAT) on energy, which it says would cost \u20ac7bn (\u00a35.9bn) for the rest of this year and \u20ac12bn in a full year. The RN would also scrap a 2023 increase in the retirement age to 64 from 62, and says its spending plans would be paid for by cutting contributions to the EU budget. The left-wing New Popular Front alliance, now polling second, says its first moves would include a 10% civil servant pay hike, providing free school lunches, supplies and transport while raising housing subsidies by 10%. The turmoil has sent the cost to the French government of servicing its debt on the international markets rocketing, with the risk premium, or spread, demanded by holders of French debt over Germany\u2019s rising to its highest level since 2012. France\u2019s blue-chip CAC 40 index is down 6% since Macron dissolved parliament, with French banks having been among the biggest losers. The big three \u2013 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, BNP Paribas and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole \u2013 are down 10%-14% since Macron\u2019s announcement. French banks have a large amount of debt and are expected to suffer if credit costs increase sharply. The positive for Carstens was that central banks have successfully reined in inflation, which had hit decades-long highs after the Covid-19 pandemic, and then Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which riled commodity markets. \u201cCompared to last year, I have to say we are in a much better place,\u201d the former Mexican central bank governor said. Although Carstens said central banks deserved praise for navigating a difficult path that could have resulted in a wave of recessions, he added that they needed to persevere, likening the inflation fight to a course of antibiotics to tackle an illness. He described an \u201cextreme\u201d scenario where inflation raced up again and central banks needed to raise rates further. But that is not what the BIS expects."

            "date": "2024-06-22T20:31:26Z",
            "content": "Water companies in England and Wales have averaged five serious sewage spills into rivers or seas every day over the past decade, the Observer can reveal. Analysis of Environment Agency data has found that the 10 firms recorded 19,484 category 1-3 pollution incidents between 2013 and 2022, the most recent year recorded, an average of one every four and a half hours. Campaigners accused the water industry of \u201cpolluting our rivers and seas at a catastrophic scale\u201d, while Labour said the government had \u201cfolded their arms and looked the other way\u201d as the crisis worsened. Thames Water was the worst offending company according to the Environmental Performance Assessments analysed by this newspaper, recording some 3,568 incidents in that time, followed by Southern Water (2,747), Severn Trent (2,712) and Anglian Water (2,572). Most of the incidents recorded were category 3, the least severe of those collected and a type that is supposed to have only a localised effect. But the figures are also likely to be an underestimate. The number and severity of sewage spill incidents are self-reported by water companies themselves. The incidents, and their actual severity and impact, often go unverified. The Environment Agency, which regulates the sector, has faced staff shortages and major budget cuts that have forced it in the past to tell its inspectors to not investigate less serious incidents in order to cut down on costs. Between 2020 and 2022, there were reportedly 931 pollution incidents in the north-west of England, but the EA attended just six. A BBC investigation last year into the area\u2019s water company, United Utilities, found that it had wrongly downgraded the severity of a significant number of its own sewage spills to lower categories, with the result that it avoided potential further scrutiny from the EA. The state of the UK\u2019s rivers and seas has become a major campaign issue in the general election. Labour\u2019s shadow environment secretary, Steve Reed, told the Observer that the Conservative government had \u201cjust folded their arms and looked the other way while water companies pumped a tidal wave of raw sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas\u201d. He said that Labour, if elected, would give regulators the power to ban bonus payments and even levy criminal charges for \u201claw-breaking water bosses\u201d. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, whose rural Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency is one of the 25 worst affected by sewage releases, said the issue was a \u201cnational scandal which has gotten worse and worse under the Conservatives\u2019 watch\u201d. \u201cThe Conservatives\u2019 record is one of rising sewage levels and water firms stuffing their pockets with cash,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Liberal Democrats have led the campaign against sewage, with plans for a new water regulator, an end to disgraceful bonuses and profits, and new sewage inspectors.\u201d In March it was revealed that England\u2019s privatised water firms released raw sewage for a total of 3.6m hours in 2023, more than double the scale from the year before. A small number of untreated sewage releases are allowed during periods of unprecedented rainfall when sewerage systems are overwhelmed, but a recent BBC investigation found thousands of \u201cillegal\u201d releases on days when it hadn\u2019t rained, including during a record heatwave. Despite the growing scrutiny of the industry in recent years, the pay packets for its leadership have remained high, with the nine chief executives of UK water companies receiving more than \u00a325m in bonuses and incentives since the last general election. That has included bonuses awarded for hitting environmental and sustainability targets. \u201cThis is further evidence of what we\u2019ve all long suspected: water companies are polluting our rivers and seas at a catastrophic scale, each and every day,\u201d said Giles Bristow, the chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage. \u201cThese companies are brazen in their lack of regard for the law and have been allowed to pollute with barely more than a slap on the wrist.\u201d A Conservative spokesperson said the government had been clear that \u201cwater companies need to be held to account\u201d and that they had \u201cintroduced unprecedented levels of transparency with 100% monitoring, and applied the largest ever fines to law-breaking water companies\u201d. A spokesperson for Water UK, the organisation that represents water companies, said that numbers of the most serious pollution incidents had fallen over the last decade, and stressed that the industry plans to invest \u00a3100bn into its network that will come into action once it receives approval from the regulator, Ofwat."

            "date": "2024-06-22T07:00:26Z",
            "content": "So-called MRP polls, which use large-scale polling data to extrapolate individual seat tallies, have become something of an obsession in UK politics since an early version by YouGov predicted 2017\u2019s hung parliament, while other surveys were tipping an easy Conservative win. So popular are MRPs, an acronym for a very technical approach known as multilevel regression and post-stratification, that three were published on a single day this week. All gave pretty different results, particularly when it came to the fate of the Tories. So what would these various scenarios, if replicated on 4 July, mean for the Conservatives and their future, particularly in terms of personalities and ideology? Loss: More in Common, 155 Tory MPs Amazing as it might sound were you to tell this to a Conservative MP in mid-2021, when the Tories were 15-plus points ahead of Labour in polls, quite a lot of party officials and candidates would probably accept this result if it were offered now: a Labour majority of 162. Even with this scenario there would be some high-profile casualties \u2013 understandably, given it is a cull of 210 Tories from the 2019 election. The MRP extrapolation predicts Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, would lose his seat to the Lib Dems, with fellow cabinet ministers Grant Shapps and Mark Harper among those ousted by Labour. What would the remaining parliamentary party look like? There are many imponderables, not least the influx of new MPs, with dozens of incumbent Tories having stepped down. It would, at least, be the opposition by some distance \u2013 under this model the Lib Dems would have 50 MPs \u2013 and there would be plenty of big beasts to compete for the leadership were Rishi Sunak to step down or be challenged. Jostling for this race has already begun, with Kemi Badenoch, Priti Patel, Suella Braverman and Robert Jenrick expected to try their luck from the right of the party. For the centrists, while Shapps would be gone, the home secretary, James Cleverly, would still be around, as would Penny Mordaunt, whose Portsmouth seat is seen as very vulnerable to Labour. In brief: expect a big fight. Rout: YouGov, 108 Tory MPs We are now venturing into fevered-nightmare territory for Tory MPs. If not approaching a Canada 1993-style complete wipeout, this would still be the Tories\u2019 lowest-ever Commons tally. The Labour majority of 200 would be greater than that won by Tony Blair in 1997. The list of top Conservatives losing their seats would also increase, taking in Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, who would lose in Chichester to the Lib Dems, forecast by YouGov to gain 67 seats. Senior Tories toppled by Labour would include Mordaunt, as well as Shapps and Harper, plus Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, with Cleverly\u2019s seat almost too close to call. If the home secretary joined Mordaunt and Shapps in being ousted, that would leave the ranks of senior centrist Tories quite thin, perhaps needing someone like Tom Tugendhat to step up \u2013 which he may well do anyway. Another key change in this scenario is Reform UK winning five seats, among them Nigel Farage in Clacton. Would a decimated and divided Conservative party be vulnerable to a hostile takeover by Farage? More moderate Tories would loathe this, but might end up being powerless to stop it. Wipeout: Savanta, 53 Tory MPs Yes, the Conservative parliamentary party would still exist, but it could comfortably fit into one of the larger Commons committee rooms. As a proportional decline from 2019, this would be more or less the same as the Lib Dems suffered in the 2015 elections, renowned as perhaps the most brutal electoral punishment beating in modern UK politics. The Labour majority of 382 would be, in effect, off the psephological charts, not far short of double the previously biggest single-party majority in comparable history, the 209 won by Stanley Baldwin\u2019s Conservatives in 1924. Savanta\u2019s list of senior Conservatives who could lose their seats under this scenario is, as you\u2019d expect, eye-popping, taking in a series of MPs from the right of the party who occupy what would normally be seen as ultra-safe seats. Among its names are Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, and Richard Holden, whose 180-mile flit from his North West Durham seat, which vanished under boundary changes, to Basildon and Billericay in Essex, would be rewarded with a loss to Labour. Under this scenario, Braverman and Badenoch would be vulnerable \u2013 and even Sunak himself, who recorded a 27,000-plus majority in his Richmond, Yorkshire seat in 2019. What would be left for the stragglers in this post-apocalyptic Tory landscape? Whoever took over would, at least, be opposition leader under this model, which predicts a Lib Dem total of 50. They would, however, be facing a Labour parliamentary party almost 10 times bigger, numbering 516. Who would emerge as leader from this wreckage? It is almost impossible to tell, not least because it is hard to know how many viable candidates would even want to take on this most thankless challenge. One curiosity of the Savanta MRP is that it predicts zero Reform seats, even for Farage, meaning that if the Conservatives did want to make him their leader, they would need to find a seat for him first, and one he had a chance of winning. A final note MRP polling can be hugely informative, but it is heavily caveated, not least by the pollsters themselves, all of whom emphasise that many dozens of seats are too close to call, meaning the totals could end up being quite different. Those who put together the polls also stress that, as with all algorithm-based models, the numbers you get depend not just on the raw polling results, but also the complex models used to crunch the data. And, as with all polls, it is a snapshot, not a prediction."

            "date": "2024-06-20T15:00:39Z",
            "content": "Australians\u2019 annual household power bills could increase by hundreds of dollars, and up to $1,000, under a Coalition plan to slow the rollout of large-scale renewable energy and use more gas-fired electricity before nuclear plants are ready, analysts say. As Peter Dutton faced cross-party resistance to his announcement that he would go to the next election promising to eventually build seven nuclear plants, energy market analysts warned the Coalition\u2019s proposal would probably lead to a significant rise in prices over the next decade, before a nuclear industry came online. Few details of the opposition\u2019s proposal have been released, but Dutton told a press conference on Wednesday that the Coalition would restrict investment in solar and windfarms and cover the electricity shortfall created as old coal-fired plants shut over the next two decades by using more gas power. Analysts said gas was a far more expensive power source in the national grid than renewable energy or coal, and opening new gas basins was unlikely to change this as the country\u2019s cheap gas had already been extracted. They said adding more gas power could also increase greenhouse gas emissions, accelerating the climate crisis. Tristan Edis, a director with the firm Green Energy Markets, said the wholesale electricity price was set by the most expensive fuel being used at any given time. Those prices were \u201cvery high\u201d \u2013 between $250 and $300 per megawatt hour of electricity, about three times the average price \u2013 whenever fast-start gas plants were used to complement cheaper coal, solar, wind and hydro energy. Gas now provides less than 5% of electricity in the national electricity market, and is only called on when needed to meet demand. Edis said if a Coalition government put a hold on investment in solar and windfarms and boosted gas power so that it was replacing coal and always setting the price, \u201cyou\u2019re talking about an increase of $500 to potentially even $1,000 per annum for a household power bill\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Dr Roger Dargaville, an associate professor and the interim director of the Monash Energy Institute, said it was difficult to predict what the Coalition\u2019s announcement would mean for bills due to a lack of detail, but agreed the increase in an annual bill could be $1,000. \u201cIt seems the options being presented will either lead to extraordinary maintenance bills to keep old coal plants going or using a lot more gas,\u201d he said. \u201cCoal is a very cheap fuel, so if you\u2019re going from a coal-dominated system to a gas-dominated system, you are going to see very steep energy prices.\u201d Dargaville said more renewable energy backed by \u201cfirming\u201d support \u2013 including energy storage, new transmission lines and gas power only when required \u2013 was \u201cthe only sensible option and almost certainly the least cost option\u201d. Dr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems researcher at the University of New South Wales, agreed that using more gas-fired power would push up prices for consumers. He estimated the increase in annual bills, if gas replaced renewable energy as the main new energy source over the next decade, could be $400 or $500. \u201cIf you slow the rollout of renewable energy and backfill with gas we\u2019re talking about quite a large cost,\u201d McConnell said. The analysts\u2019 estimates are at odds with the Coalition\u2019s claim that its approach would lead to \u201ccheaper, cleaner and consistent electricity\u201d compared with the Albanese government\u2019s goal of 82% of generation coming from renewable sources by 2030. Labor suggested before the last election that under its policies average annual power bills would fall $275 by 2025. Instead, bills went up. The Coalition has blamed the rise on new renewable energy but analysts say it was largely due to fossil fuels, including the Ukraine war pushing up gas and coal prices. Regulators say prices for households should fall up to 7% next year. The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, told the ABC\u2019s Radio National on Thursday that power prices could be reduced under the Coalition before nuclear came online because of \u201cshorter-term strategies\u201d including using more gas. The opposition has said it would make announcements on gas and renewable energy before the election. Coalition MPs have signalled they may offer more support for household solar systems but stall investment in the large-scale renewable developments. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has argued \u201cwe won\u2019t need them\u201d. Dutton said he wanted the commonwealth to build nuclear plants on the site of existing or past coal-fired plants in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia. But he has not released the cost of the plants, explained how the Coalition would lift legislated federal and state bans on nuclear power, or said why he believed the first two plants could be operating by 2035 or 2037 \u2013 a much faster timeframe than experts say would be possible. On Friday the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute released the results of a survey of 1,005 Australians that it commissioned from the firm Dynata in May. It found nearly two-thirds (65%) said they were not prepared to pay extra to have nuclear power in the mix. But nearly one-quarter of respondents said they would be prepared to pay more to introduce nuclear. About 4% said they were prepared to pay more than $500 extra a year. The executive director of the Australia Institute, Richard Denniss, said it showed that \u201cresidents across the country, regardless of who they vote for, don\u2019t support a nuclear future that requires them pay more for electricity than they already do\u201d."

            "date": "2024-06-28T15:00:28Z",
            "content": "Major private debt collector Panthera Finance has appointed new directors and put parts of the company into administration as it seeks to sell off its scandal-plagued business. Last month, Guardian Australia revealed Panthera, one of the country\u2019s biggest private debt collection firms, had circumvented a blacklisting designed to stop it from operating in Victoria and continued to strike debt purchase deals within weeks of regulatory warnings. The company has now announced two of its holding companies have been voluntarily placed into administration. Two new directors \u2013 the existing chief financial officer, Frank Terranova, and Ryan Shaw \u2013 have also been appointed. The company denies the moves are linked in any way to public revelations about its circumvention of the Victorian blacklisting and a related investigation by Consumer Affairs Victoria (CAV), which could result in significant fines. The company has brought in PwC consultants to assist with the voluntary administration process. It says its day-to-day debt collection business will not be affected and that its subsidiaries, including Panthera Finance Pty Ltd, the company subject to the CAV investigation, are operating as usual. \u201cPanthera Finance Group continues to operate on a business-as-usual basis after the group\u2019s holding companies entered voluntary administration on Wednesday,\u201d a spokesperson for Panthera said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cThe group\u2019s subsidiary companies are not in voluntary administration and will continue to conduct their normal activities under the leadership of Panthera\u2019s existing chief financial officer, Frank Terranova, and Ryan Shaw, who have been appointed as directors.\u201d \u201cThe voluntary administrators, Andrew Scott, Adam Colley, Derrick Vickers and Stephen Longley of PwC Australia, have advised us that at this stage they do not foresee any changes to the group\u2019s ordinary business activities and are undertaking a process to decide on the appropriate next steps for the Panthera business.\u201d The two companies put into administration were PF Group Holdings Pty Ltd (PFGH) and PF Management Holdings Pty Ltd (PFMH). PwC said the move would not affect the subsidiaries and their ongoing debt collection work across the country. Colley said: \u201cWe intend to urgently assess the options available to PFGH and PFMH as the parent entities of the Panthera Finance Group of companies and will work closely with stakeholders to ensure minimal disruption to the group\u2019s operations. \u201cWe will be undertaking a process to identify interested parties who may wish to purchase the business as a whole or to acquire distinct operating units or assets.\u201d One of its main subsidiaries, Panthera Finance Pty Ltd, was blacklisted from operating in Victoria in 2020 due to a federal court finding it had unlawfully harassed Australians for money they did not owe. Despite the blacklisting, Panthera Finance Pty Ltd continued to buy up and collect debt. A Guardian investigation last month revealed that Panthera Finance Pty Ltd had received direct warnings from CAV in 2022 to cease operating in the state or face criminal sanctions. Within weeks of the warning, the same company struck debt purchase agreements to buy up old debt from Origin and Optus, the Guardian revealed. Origin said it was left oblivious to any restriction on Panthera\u2019s debt collection activity prior to the sale. The company argues that it did not breach any law because it was using another entity to collect debts in Victoria, the similarly named Panthera Finance (Vic) Pty Ltd. That entity is owned by the same parent company, has the same principal place of business, staff numbers and directors, and uses a carbon copy website that appears to have been created as recently as last year. The entity only began using the name Panthera Finance (Vic) Pty Ltd in June 2022, about the same time as Panthera\u2019s dealings with the regulator. It was called CDDS Pty Ltd for about 15 years before that. CAV says it is investigating Panthera\u2019s conduct but is yet to announce any enforcement action. A Panthera spokesperson previously said Panthera Finance had voluntarily contacted the Victorian regulator in May 2022 to alert it to a potential problem with the licence it needs to engage in debt collection. \u201cAs soon as Panthera Finance Pty Ltd became aware of a possible licensing requirement under the act, we voluntarily contacted the regulator on 17 May 2022,\u201d the spokesperson said."

            "date": "2024-06-20T04:00:29Z",
            "content": "The world\u2019s consumption of fossil fuels climbed to a record high last year, driving emissions to more than 40 gigatonnes of CO2 for the first time, according to a global energy report. Despite a record rise in the use of renewable energy in 2023, consumption of fossil fuels continued to increase too, an annual review of world energy by the Energy Institute found. Juliet Davenport, the president of the Energy Institute, said the report had revealed \u201canother year of highs in our energy-hungry world\u201d including a record high consumption of fossil fuels, which rose by 1.5% to 505 exajoules. The findings threaten to dash hopes held by climate scientists that 2023 would be recorded as the year in which annual emissions peaked before the global fossil fuel economy begins a terminal decline. The Energy Institute, the global professional body for the energy sector, found that while energy industry emissions may have reached a peak in advanced economies, developing economies are continuing to increase their reliance on coal, gas and oil. Overall, fossil fuels made up 81.5% of the world\u2019s primary energy last year, down only marginally from 82% the year before, according to the report, even as wind and solar farms generated record amounts of clean electricity. The report, authored by consultants at KPMG and Kearney, found that wind and solar power climbed by 13% last year to reach a new record of 4,748 terawatt hours in 2023. But that was not enough to match the world\u2019s growing consumption of primary energy, which rose 2% last year to a record high of 620 exajoules and led to more fossil fuel use. The review found that the world\u2019s appetite for gas remained steady in 2024 while consumption of coal climbed by 1.6% and oil demand rose by 2% to reach 100m barrels a day for the first time. Simon Virley, the UK head of energy and natural resources at KPMG, said: \u201cIn a year where we have seen the contribution of renewables reaching a new record high, ever increasing global energy demand means the share coming from fossil fuels has remained virtually unchanged at just over 80% for yet another year.\u201d Nick Wayth, the Energy Institute\u2019s chief executive, added that the \u201cslow\u201d progress of the energy transition \u201cmasks diverse energy stories playing out across different geographies\u201d. \u201cIn advanced economies, we observe signs of demand for fossil fuels peaking, contrasting with economies in the global south for whom economic development and improvements in quality of life continue to drive fossil growth,\u201d said Wayth. The report found that, in India, fossil fuel consumption climbed by 8% last year, matching the increase in overall energy demand to make up 89% of all energy use. This meant that, for the first time, more coal was used in India than Europe and North America combined, it said. In Europe, fossil fuels fell to below 70% of primary energy use for the first time since the Industrial Revolution, driven by falling demand and the growth of renewable energy. Europe\u2019s demand for gas in particular has continued to tumble since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which caused pipeline gas imports into Europe to collapse. Overall gas demand fell by 7% in 2023, according to the report, after a fall of 13% the previous year."

            "content": "Young people feel more economically insecure, ignored and apathetic than the average voter before the election, amid evidence that they could be fuelling the growth of smaller parties. A strong rejection of the Conservative party among the youngest voters continues to be evident: the latest Opinium poll for the Observer has a 52-point Labour lead among the under-35s. But analysts pointed to economic pessimism and potential apathy that could also spell trouble for Labour in the years ahead. The European elections last week saw young voters help the rise of the far right in countries including France and Germany. While analysts said there is limited evidence Reform UK has picked up substantially more younger voters in the UK \u2013 some polls in the last week had it ahead of, or on a par with, the Tories among 18- to 24-year-olds \u2013 it is the Liberal Democrats and Greens who could stand to benefit if young people ultimately feel uninspired by Keir Starmer\u2019s pitch. \u201cThey tend to be much more pessimistic about the economy than the population overall,\u201d said Keiran Pedley, director of politics at Ipsos. \u201cIn 2023, younger people tended to be as pessimistic about the economy as they were during the pandemic, with young women particularly pessimistic. That has not always been the case. There\u2019s no surprise to anybody that housing is much more of an issue for this group.\u201d The dynamics of an election in which the Tories are trying to shore up their core vote and Labour is going after middle England also has the potential to leave young voters out. \u201cOn average, 43% of our respondents who have a voting intention say that there\u2019s no chance they\u2019re going to change their mind,\u201d said Guy Miscampbell, head of political and social research at Focaldata. \u201cThat\u2019s only 24% for 18- to 24-year-olds, rising to 38% for 25- to 34-year-olds. \u201cIf you\u2019re a young person who\u2019s facing really high rents, tuition fees and a job market with low real-term wage growth, it\u2019s hard to feel that there\u2019s a party representing you \u2026 Overall, 18- to 24-year-olds are fractionally more likely to be supporting non-major parties and slightly less likely to report satisfaction when voting or [about] the idea of voting.\u201d If they are put off by Starmer, Pedley said that the Greens could benefit. \u201cIf you look at Green voters generally, they do tend to be younger than the population as a whole,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also tend to be very dissatisfied with Keir Starmer, which separates them from Liberal Democrat voters, who tend to be net neutral on Starmer.\u201d In Luton, a town with one of the youngest populations outside areas dominated by a university, there was evidence of both anger at the Tories and a lack of enthusiasm for Labour. Patryk Kuna recently turned 18 and is still undecided on who his vote will go to. \u201cLabour has been making some pretty funny TikToks, so I might vote for Labour, maybe,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t like the guy [Rishi Sunak] in general. No one picked him for office so why is he there?\u201d Distrust of the Conservatives was echoed by 18-year-old Izzy Cowell, though she will vote Green, not Labour. \u201cI don\u2019t want to vote for Labour,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s another way to change things and not rely on a two-party system. I used to resonate with [Labour] quite a bit, but I wouldn\u2019t say that any more. I no longer agree with their leader or what they currently stand for.\u201d Nashe, a 23-year-old hospitality worker, voted Labour in 2019, but will not vote for the party this time. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in Palestine and the reactions from politicians has impacted my decision to not vote for Labour again,\u201d she said. A 25-year-old NHS worker, who chose to remain anonymous, said she is not voting this year and has a lot of distrust towards all parties and politicians. She is one of many young people in Luton who are apathetic about the forthcoming election. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of young people like me who don\u2019t give a shit because our vote doesn\u2019t count and it\u2019s all about what the old people think,\u201d she said. However, Bruno Rebelo, 24, wants to fight against the unwillingness to vote demonstrated by other young people. He said: \u201cI think voting sometimes isn\u2019t about making a difference but is about sending a message. It\u2019s all about numbers, so if people in power see that change is wanted through voting numbers, then something might come out of that.\u201d In a sign that their attention might be elsewhere, parties have not figured out how to make use of new routes to younger voters such as TikTok, according to Dr Stephanie Luke, a researcher for the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank. \u201cThere\u2019s different strategies with TikTok and I don\u2019t think necessarily any political party has really got the ability to use it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first post for the Tories was Rishi Sunak\u2019s announcement on national service. Doing the same content on TikTok as Twitter [now X] is not a good strategy. It requires tailor-made content. Labour is currently top for followers, but it is not increasing substantially.\u201d There are attempts to engage the young. Green energy tycoon and Labour donor Dale Vince has been funding a campaign to boost turnout that claims people who vote are seen as more attractive. He said he was inspired by new voter ID rules that he feared would hit young people more: \u201cThe voter ID laws do focus on younger people and make it harder for them than it is for older people.You can use an old person\u2019s bus pass as proof, but you can\u2019t use a young person\u2019s student card.\u201d"

            "content": "Rishi Sunak must be cursing the British weather. He got soaked to the skin when announcing the general election outside 10 Downing Street last month. Now it appears wet weather has brought a halt to the UK\u2019s economic recovery. Statisticians always caution against reading too much into a single month\u2019s figures and on a quarterly basis things don\u2019t look too bad for the prime minister. Indeed, the economy expanded by 0.7% in the three months to April, compared with 0.6% in the quarter ending in March. But during an election campaign each piece of economic data takes on heightened importance and Labour was quick to exploit the fact that there was zero growth in April. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said it exposed the damage caused by 14 years of \u201cConservative chaos\u201d. In truth, it looks as if Reeves will inherit an economy in a slightly better state that she might have imagined a few months ago. The economy is out of recession and inflation is expected to be back to the government\u2019s 2% target when the May figures are released next week. What\u2019s more, the economy would have grown in April had it not been for a 1.7% drop in construction output and a 2% fall in retail activity. Both declines were almost certainly weather-related. That\u2019s not to say the economy would have exactly been booming had April not been so cold and wet. Manufacturing output, which is not affected by the weather, fell by 1.7%. Sunak really can\u2019t catch a break. The latest growth figures are not strong enough for him to boast about on the campaign trail but not weak enough to persuade the Bank of England to cut interest rates next week. Threadneedle Street is expecting growth in the second quarter to be just 0.2% but that looks overly pessimistic. It would only take monthly growth of 0.1% in both May and June for the economy to expand by 0.4% in the second quarter. Unless something truly unexpected happens in the next three weeks, Reeves will be installed in the Treasury by the time borrowing costs start to come down."

            "content": "A new era of protectionism is leading to slower global growth and hindering attempts to eradicate poverty, the World Bank has warned. The Washington-based institution said 80% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 more than 6 billion people \u2013 were living in countries where growth would be slower in the next three years than in the pre-Covid decade. In its half-yearly global economic prospects, the World Bank said the model of international cooperation that had allowed the poorest countries to close the gap with the wealthiest had fractured. Even though the global economy had avoided recession, it had stabilised at a lower level than in the years leading up to the start of the pandemic. Indermit Gill, the World Bank\u2019s chief economist, said policymakers had cause to celebrate a \u201csoft landing\u201d despite the steepest rise in global interest rates since the 1980s. \u201cBut they would be wise to keep their eye on the ball: growth rates remain too slow for progress. Without stronger international cooperation and a concerted push for policies that advance shared prosperity, the world could become stuck in the slow lane.\u201d The bank\u2019s forecasts show global growth holding steady at 2.6% in 2024 before edging up to an average of 2.7% in 2025-26. In the pre-Covid decade, growth averaged 3.1%. Gill said progress towards prosperity occurred when governments put in place policies that fostered productivity, entrepreneurship and innovation \u2013 and when they did so while cooperating. \u201cThat was the model that flourished after the fall of the Berlin Wall. By encouraging the flow of goods, capital, and ideas across borders, it ushered in an extraordinary era of global prosperity: a span of roughly 25 years when the incomes of the poorest nations, on average, were catching up with those of the wealthiest, and when the world came within striking distance of ending extreme poverty,\u201d he said. But Gill added its global economic prospects provided a \u201csobering assessment\u201d of how the model of international cooperation had been fracturing, pointing to how trade measures designed to restrain cross-border commercial flows were growing at a historic pace. \u201cFour years after the upheavals caused by the pandemic, conflicts, inflation, and monetary tightening, it appears that global economic growth is steadying,\u201d Gill said. \u201cHowever, growth is at lower levels than before 2020. Prospects for the world\u2019s poorest economies are even more worrisome. They face punishing levels of debt service, constricting trade possibilities, and costly climate events. Developing economies will have to find ways to encourage private investment, reduce public debt, and improve education, health, and basic infrastructure.\u201d Gill said the world\u2019s 75 poorest countries, eligible for grants or cheap loans from the bank, would not be able to make the necessary progress without international support."

            "date": "2024-06-30T10:00:20Z",
            "content": "Ron DeSantis stripped more than $32m in arts and culture funding from Florida\u2019s state budget over his hatred of a popular fringe festival that he accused of being \u201ca sexual event\u201d, critics of the rightwing governor say. DeSantis justified his unprecedented, wide-ranging veto of grants to almost 700 groups and organizations by saying it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d for $7,369 of state money to be allocated to Tampa fringe, a 10-day festival that took place earlier this month with a strong message of inclusivity, and its sister event in Orlando. \u201c[It\u2019s] like a sexual festival where they\u2019re doing all this stuff,\u201d DeSantis said at a press conference Thursday, without elaborating. \u201cWhen I see money being spent that way, I have to be the one to stand up for taxpayers and say: \u2018You know what, that is an inappropriate use of taxpayer dollars.\u2019\u201d As a result, he has canceled almost the entirety of Florida\u2019s already slim funding to the arts world, denying much-needed dollars to a diverse array of groups including youth orchestras and choirs, museums, art galleries, dance troupes, zoos, cinemas and community theaters. Most rely on the state contribution to operate fully, or in many cases simply for their survival. So it makes little sense to any of them that what DeSantis sees as standing up for the taxpayer equates to killing performances, exhibitions and jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a combination of everything, from tightening our programming and salaries, and going to our patrons, once again, for donations,\u201d said Margaret Ledford, artistic director of City Theatre Miami, a small performing arts group that, among other projects, focuses on presenting short-form plays to middle schoolers. Her group, with two full-time and three part-time employees, lost a $47,000 grant, about 6% of its annual budget. Other allocations quashed by DeSantis range from $500,000 each for organizations including the Tampa Museum of Art, Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Museum of Science and Discovery and Miami\u2019s Pelican Harbor seabird station, to a few thousand dollars each for groups such as the Amelia Island opera and the Annasemble community orchestra of Gainesville. Ledford is among those who believe the governor\u2019s action against the arts world is purely political, a continuation of his well-documented targeting of minority groups, including the LGBTQ+ community, through executive action and legislation designed to stifle discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity. Asked for details, the governor\u2019s office issued a statement condemning a performance at Tampa fringe that featured transgender characters. \u201cYou can\u2019t say gay, you can\u2019t do anything he considers woke, and the word climate change has been taken out of state statutes,\u201d Ledford said. \u201cWe\u2019re also trying to figure out how we reach the students of the community if we can\u2019t talk about things they need to talk about in schools. If we bring in a play with a gay character, we can do that because we\u2019re theater, but whose job are we putting in jeopardy if a student then asks a question of a teacher?\u201d Margaret Murray, chief executive of the non-profit arts agency Creative Pinellas, called DeSantis\u2019s veto \u201cincredibly disheartening\u201d. \u201cArts money does so much more than allow us to enjoy a performance or visit a museum, and now is the time to invest more heavily, rather than less, in our cultural community,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cAccording to a recent report by the Florida Cultural Alliance, every $1 spent on the arts generates $9 in economic activity. Unfortunately, there is little recourse to reverse the state\u2019s decision, but we do still have a voice. Please continue supporting the artists and arts organizations. Now is the time to buy that piece of artwork or purchase tickets to the play you recently heard about. Collectively, we can amplify our advocacy for the arts and make our voices heard.\u201d Among those also puzzled by DeSantis\u2019s motives are political allies, some in the Republican-dominated Florida legislature that crafted a $117.5bn state budget earlier this year that the governor trimmed by almost $1bn before signing it this month. Those politicians rubber stamped grant applicants that were vetted and approved by the Florida Council on Arts and Culture, a 15-member advisory body hand-picked by the governor. Additionally, the state\u2019s own publications trumpet the economic value of investment in arts and culture, a $3.1bn industry in Florida that it says \u201csupports jobs, generates government revenue and is a cornerstone of tourism\u201d. Anna Eskamani, a Democratic state representative representing Orlando, said DeSantis\u2019s veto was irrational. \u201cIf we\u2019re struggling economically, then yes, you cut programs, those that aren\u2019t going to impact things like public safety, education, food security. You go after the line items that won\u2019t lead to urgent problems,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not there. Florida has like $17bn in reserves, and this was $32m, a drop in the bucket compared to the budget as a whole. Now these organizations are going to have to make budget decisions, likely reduce staff, cancel programs and reduce the events they can host. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a ripple effect because the folks going to the shows are eating at the small restaurant next door, they\u2019re buying printed materials and swag the art group is selling, they\u2019re paying to park, there\u2019s an entire ecosystem that revolves around arts and culture. \u201cThat\u2019s why it makes no sense. It\u2019s another DeSantis culture war, the same old playbook, just a different chapter.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-27T05:00:29Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s the middle of August 2023 and the Danish It-girl brand Ganni is throwing a party to celebrate the last night of Copenhagen fashion week. In a room hidden behind a heaving dancefloor, Paloma Elsesser, the curve New York model who opened Ganni\u2019s show hours before, is dominating the karaoke room and creative director Ditte Reffstrup is dancing on the bar. It feels like a celebration from a different era. Independent designers are struggling. The news of Matches Fashion\u2019s closure in March was followed by announcements that the Vampire\u2019s Wife and Mara Hoffman would shut down. Roksanda had filed a notice of intent to appoint an administrator, a fate avoided only by the entrance of a buyer. All offer similarly playful garments and are, in many ways, despite higher prices, Ganni\u2019s peers. But the Danish brand, which Reffstrup took over in 2009 alongside her husband, Nikolaj, has reason to be cheerful. The brand is stocked at more than 600 retailers globally and has 70 concept stores across Europe, North America and Asia. The Ganni Girls hashtag, a social media calling card for anyone wearing the brand, has been used more than 111,000 times on Instagram. Laura du Rusquec, the former deputy CEO of Balenciaga, was recently named CEO. In 2017, LVMH-backed investment firm L Catterton bought 51% of the business. Last year, Ganni launched a series of high-profile collaborations that included Barbour, New Balance and Dr Martens and in May this year a line in collaboration with Elsesser. If you haven\u2019t heard of Ganni, you have probably seen it. For several years it has been the choice brand of a certain well-heeled young professional, offering easy-to-wear, feminine garments that can be worn at the office and for the bike ride in, or to dinner out afterwards. They represent the sartorial side of the Scandimania that took over our lives in recent years, from TV to baked goods and furniture. True to Scandi-form, Ganni is big on sustainability, too. It has set the ambitious goal of halving its emissions by 2027 and, according to its latest responsibility report (the brand eschews the word \u201csustainability\u201d due to overuse) in 2023, Ganni\u2019s carbon emissions were 7% lower than a 2021 baseline \u2013 despite revenue growing by an average of 18%. It is an impressive achievement that timed perfectly with the publication of The Ganni Playbook: How to Get Started Creating a Responsible Business, a sort of sustainable business manifesto out now. Almost 10 months have passed since the party, and I am back in Copenhagen, sitting in the Reffstrups\u2019 eclectic, airy home \u2013 the living room is all bright colours and natural textures \u2013 to talk about the book and the formula that keeps Ganni, and the look it epitomises, thriving against the odds. The couple themselves are a good place to start. They met on a dance floor 20 years ago and were married in seven months. \u201cShe was always wearing a mix of vintage so she would kind of look like the lead singer from Bananarama one day and something else the next,\u201d says Nicolaj, some helium balloons \u2013 probably from one of their three children\u2019s parties \u2013 bobbing against the ceiling behind him. Today Ditte is wearing an oversized silver blazer, a white T-shirt, against which a turquoise pendant hangs, and a black pointelle skirt. A few years after they met, Ditte \u2013 an experienced fashion buyer \u2013 was approached to design some cashmere garments for a friend\u2019s small fashion label called Ganni. Nicolaj was working in tech start-ups and understood how to scale a brand. Together, they identified a customer who was not being served by the minimalist, normcore Scandi designers that were popular in 2009 and decided to take over the business.The customer they identified as underserved was essentially Ditte \u2013 the original so-called Ganni Girl. She has proven to be the business\u2019s silver bullet, embodying something aspirational that appeals to women of many ages, nationalities and body types, as well as having a keen understanding of what women want from clothes. While the term Ganni Girl may sound like cloying marketing jargon, it came about shockingly, almost irritatingly organically. In 2015, the model Helena Christensen came to lunch with a friend, the actor Kate Bosworth. Both wore the same Ganni jacket. They snapped a selfie, wrote #GanniGirls in the caption and a clique was born. \u201c[The Ganni Girl may] not be the most obviously beautiful girl in the room or wearing the most trendy clothes,\u201d says Ditte. \u201cBut she\u2019ll just have this certain aura around her \u2013 an energy and the confidence that comes when you dress for yourself and no one else.\u201d The term has inspired a coffee table book and the trope has even made it into literature. In his Sunday Times bestseller, Trivial Pursuits, the writer Raven Smith describes a drunk party trick so misguided it resulted in \u201cmuch spilled prosecco and many a drenched Ganni dress.\u201d The line is a gripe \u2013 the Ganni girl can be seen as a bit, in modern parlance, \u201cbasic\u201d. But it shows how far she has come.Ganni has been shrewd, capitalising on the immediacy and community social media offers by focusing on local influencers that have a more engaged following over celebrities with bigger audiences. Although the hashtag was a happy accident, building a community around it was strategic. For all its local roots, Nicolaj knew the brand would not survive if it did not work for customers outside Denmark. Ganni\u2019s outlook has always been purposefully global. They have kept prices accessible, believing it would help the brand to endure. \u201cIt has always been a joy to create something that people actually use,\u201d says Ditte. \u201cLike having a restaurant that people actually enjoy eating in, or making music that people are actually listening to.\u201d The only time Ganni\u2019s pursuit of the best product is forsaken is when it comes into conflict with achieving their carbon goals. If the book has one recurring theme it is how to make money without maximising it at the expense of the planet. This will be interesting to watch play out over the next few years \u2013 to halve their emissions they will have to focus on materials, which are responsible for 58% of Ganni\u2019s total carbon footprint. Ditte is honest about her design perspective on sustainability: initially she only saw limitations. But Ganni has become a champion of, and investor into, next-generation materials and one of their biggest achievements was phasing out virgin leather at the end of 2023, which accounted for a third of the brand\u2019s carbon footprint. Doing so meant discontinuing two colour ways of their best-selling cowboy boots at a cost to the company of \u00a3300,000 a year. Nicolaj is upfront about how expensive it is to be a responsible business. There\u2019s a \u201cdirect investment that\u2019s invisible \u2026 in the certifications, the consultants, the premium fabrics,\u201d he says. But what hurts more is \u201cthe sacrifices, the frustrations, like the letting go of bestsellers and saying no to collaborations.\u201dOf course for all of the worthy talk, like all fashion brands, the business is far from faultless \u2013 synthetic materials, which are blended through most of Ganni\u2019s garments, shed microfibres into the ocean, will never biodegrade and currently, are not able to be recycled. Nicolaj returns to a tech tagline again and again: he\u2019d rather build knowledge through trying and failing, being clear on the vision and loose on the details, rather than not trying at all. If nothing else, Nicolaj promises: \u201cGanni is honest, not perfect.\u201d The Ganni Playbook: How to Get Started Creating a Responsible Business by Nikolaj Reffstrup with Brooke Roberts-Islam, is published on 27 June by Penguin."

            "date": "2024-06-09T21:16:04Z",
            "content": "At a smart party venue overlooking the woodland of the Bois de Vincennes, east of Paris, members of Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (Rassemblement National, or RN) clinked glasses to the sound of jazz piano. Savouring their historic result in the European elections, they were also looking forward with excitement to the sudden, shock parliamentary election in France. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for power if French people put their trust in us,\u201d said Le Pen to cheers and applause from senior party officials in suits and cocktail dresses, after the president, Emmanuel Macron, made the dramatic and unexpected announcement that he was dissolving the French parliament in the wake of the results. The election, called for three weeks\u2019 time, saw Le Pen\u2019s anti-immigration party, with around 31% of the vote, come first \u2013 and more than double the score of the president\u2019s pro-European centrists. Smiling, Le Pen said her party best represented France and had succeeded in capturing French people\u2019s daily concerns, which her party officials say are immigration, the cost of living and a feeling of insecurity and fear of crime. \u201cWhen the people vote, the people win,\u201d she said. The RN\u2019s European score of over 30% is an unprecedented high for the party, a clear defeat for Macron and, in the words of one senior party member, a \u201cstepping stone\u201d to the presidential election in three years\u2019 time. But few among the elected officials and canvassers who had gathered at the celebration party overlooking one of Paris\u2019s most picturesque parks had expected Macron to drop the bombshell of dissolving the French parliament on Sunday night. As the president made the announcement on television, a roar of cheers went up across the room. It was exactly what Le Pen had wanted Macron to do \u2013 the RN has 88 members of parliament and is currently the biggest single opposition party in parliament. Le Pen said this score could now be vastly increased to \u201cconsecrate our movement as the great alternative political force\u201d in France. Macron\u2019s party, which for the past two years has struggled with no absolute majority in parliament, could not have limped on, a party adviser said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard to stop us now,\u201d said Aymeric Durox, an RN senator. The 38-year-old former history teacher in the well-heeled town of Fontainebleau had seen first-hand how this European election had won over new higher-earning, highly educated voters and public-sector workers. \u201cWe\u2019re everywhere now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no more fortress that is impossible for us to take. We have voters in every sector of life, every profession.\u201d Durox said the significant rise in teachers who voted for the party in the last French presidential election in 2022 had already shown that the party could reach beyond its traditional heartlands. \u201cIt\u2019s something that a few years ago would have been unthinkable,\u201d he said. When Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old party president who led the European election campaign, strode into the room to give a triumphant victory speech, he was accompanied by some of the RN\u2019s parliamentarians to send a message about the party\u2019s position not just in Europe, but in France. Behind him, a screen read: \u201cFrance is back.\u201d Bardella is credited with appealing to voters who would have been put off by Jean-Marie Le Pen. He does not seek to dilute the party\u2019s hardline anti-immigration message, which has not changed since the 1970s; instead he wants to make it respectable and fully mainstream. \u201cFrench citizens have shown tonight that they want change,\u201d Bardella said. \u201cTonight a wind of hope has risen over France and it is only just beginning.\u201d He said the European vote was a \u201crepudiation and clear rejection\u201d of Macron\u2019s politics. \u201cTonight, Emmanuel Macron is a weakened president. He already lacked an absolute majority in parliament, and now his margin for action has shrunk at the heart of the European parliament,\u201d Bardella said. For months, Le Pen has been suggesting that Bardella \u2013 who was elected to the European parliament five years ago when he was 23 and has very high popularity ratings \u2013 could be a potential prime minister. Now, senior party figures were putting Bardella forward as the figurehead for the new parliamentary campaign. Near the cheese platter, the carefully laid-out designer finger-food and chardonnay wine in ice buckets, a young advertising executive from Normandy said his feeling from his months canvassing on the European campaign trail was that the party had been swelled by rural and farming communities expressing anger at Macron, but also by new professionals who had never before voted for the RN. \u201cBefore, we had an electorate that was more working class. Now we\u2019re attracting managers, senior staff in big companies,\u201d he said. He had seen local membership in his branch of the party in Calvados rise from six people to 51 in less than a year. \u201cI joined the party six years ago and I\u2019ve seen a change. It\u2019s interesting how renaming the party and getting rid of the old name, Front National, has made a difference. The driving force of our ideas has remained the same: security and the fight against mass immigration.\u201d Gilles Penelle, an RN regional councillor in Brittany and senior party official, said the RN\u2019s growing support in places such as Brittany, once a pro-European stronghold for Macron\u2019s centrists, showed that \u201cthere is a message being sent that there is a countryside in France that feels abandoned, and forgotten, even in Brittany. When you take away the city of Rennes and the tourist coast, there is another Brittany that no one\u2019s talking about \u2013 that Brittany is not on the postcards, it\u2019s suffering, it feels forgotten, abandoned.\u201d Penelle said Macron was now facing an \u201cnational political crisis\u201d unprecedented in modern France. He said the president had had no choice but to call a parliamentary election in France because the governing centrists\u2019 poor performance was directly attributable Macron himself, and his prime minister, Gabriel Attal, who had been actively campaigning. \u201cThis party is at the gates of power in France,\u201d said Herv\u00e9 Moreau, a former senior gendarme from Burgundy who recently joined the RN. He said its result in the European elections meant that \u201cin people\u2019s minds, this party is the political alternative\u201d."

            "title": "Benjamin Netanyahu dissolves Israeli war cabinet ",
            "date": "2024-06-17T14:26:34Z",
            "content": "Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved the Israeli war cabinet that had been overseeing the conflict in Gaza, rebuffing his far-right allies who had been seeking seats, and apparently moving to solidify his grasp on decision-making over the fighting with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah across the Lebanese border. The prime minister announced the move to ministers, saying the war cabinet had been established as part of an agreement in which the moderate politician Benny Gantz and his National Unity party joined an emergency coalition last year. The disbanding of the war cabinet was confirmed by Israeli officials against a backdrop of mounting discontent over the conduct of the war in Gaza and calls from anti-government groups for a week of daily protests. David Mencer, a spokesperson at the prime minister\u2019s office, said the war cabinet was a \u201cprerequisite\u201d for Gantz, a former army chief and defence minister, to join a unity government. He added: \u201cSo with Mr Gantz leaving government, there is no need for the cabinet. Its duties will be taken over by the security cabinet.\u201d Netanyahu reportedly told ministers that the war cabinet was no longer needed following Gantz\u2019s resignation a week ago. Gantz, one of the members of the war cabinet, quit the coalition along with Gadi Eisenkot, one of the three observers in the body. Netanyahu is now expected to hold consultations about the Gaza war with a small group of ministers, including the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, and the strategic affairs minister, Ron Dermer, who had been in the war cabinet. The dissolution of the war cabinet is unlikely to have any meaningful impact on the conflict \u2013 decision-making will move back to the security cabinet \u2013 but the political ramifications may be more significant. The move appears to be a deliberate snub to Netanyahu\u2019s far-right allies in the coalition, including the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who had been angling for a seat in the war cabinet since Gantz\u2019s departure after complaining he had been sidelined for key decisions. Reports in the Hebrew-language media suggested Netanyahu intends to make key decisions in meetings with his own advisers, excluding Ben-Gvir, before presenting them to the security cabinet. The move comes amid divisions of opinion between Netanyahu and senior Israel Defense Forces commanders. According to reports in the Israeli media on Monday, Netanyahu told the regular Sunday meeting of the full cabinet that \u201cin order to reach the goal of eliminating the capabilities of Hamas, [he had] made decisions that were not always acceptable to the military echelon\u201d, but added: \u201cWe have a country with an army and not an army with a country.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s moves suggest an increasing confidence as the prime minister\u2019s poll numbers have improved since the departure of Gantz, which has caused the latter\u2019s polling to decline markedly. While Netanyahu had been under pressure from the Biden administration to maintain the war cabinet, which was viewed as a more moderate forum, some analysts saw the move as preserving the Israeli prime minister\u2019s desire to continue with the conflict, even as he sidelined Ben-Gvir and the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich. The small war cabinet had been the source of friction between Netanyahu and other members, including over the issue of hostages being held in Gaza by Hamas and other groups. However, the war cabinet had also worked effectively, meeting numerous times since Hamas\u2019s surprise attack on southern Israel\u2019s Gaza border communities on 7 October. In the immediate aftermath of the dissolution of the war cabinet, the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth speculated that some key decisions would now go to an expanded cabinet, sometimes numbering 50 participants, where more hawkish voices dominate, giving Netanyahu more political cover for the continuing conflict. Groups opposed to Netanyahu\u2019s leadership of war have begun a week of daily demonstrations calling for a ceasefire, a deal to secure the release of hostages and elections. While demonstrations against the prime minister during the war have yet to reach the scale of pre-war protests, Saturday\u2019s weekly demonstration in Tel Aviv attracted larger numbers than usual. Those at the rally heard a recorded message from the recently rescued hostage Andrey Kozlov, who called on the government to make a deal to secure the release of the remaining captives. \u201cNearly every Saturday night [his captors in Gaza] showed us rallies from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. I didn\u2019t count how many people were there but we saw many,\u201d Kozlov said."

            "date": "2024-06-19T05:00:24Z",
            "content": "If some mechanism existed for bringing polling day forward to this coming Thursday, I wonder how many Conservative candidates would pull the lever, taking an electoral beating now that they must otherwise dread for another fortnight. Plan A has failed, and there is no other. The prime minister hoped that polls would narrow in the campaign, as they often have done in the past. Labour would be spooked. A Conservative comeback would gain momentum in the frenzy of Fleet Street gratitude for a narrative twist and a competitive race. But hope is not a strategy. Ministers have resorted to pleading with voters not to give Keir Starmer too big a majority. There is a deficit of drama in the contest to be prime minister. The gap is filled with speculation over the size and character of Britain\u2019s next opposition. Convention dictates that this be construed as a civil war. On one side is the remnant of the traditional Tory party that David Cameron led until 2016. These are MPs who mostly voted remain and endorsed Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. They venerate fiscal discipline and managerial sobriety. They are moderate, at least by demeanour and in comparison with the other side \u2013 a messy coalition of nationalist demagogues, social reactionaries, libertarian ultras and Brexit puritans who hanker for congress with Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform party. In reality, the lines are blurred. Vibes count for more than policy. Rishi Sunak was the moderates\u2019 choice in the 2022 leadership contest against Liz Truss, who ran as the Boris Johnson continuity candidate. Truss had been a remainer in 2016. Sunak got no credit for his superior Brexit credentials. In many respects, Johnson\u2019s instincts were to the left of both of them. He had no qualms about state intervention when it came to levelling up, building infrastructure and accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy. Sunak jettisoned those goals. The current prime minister\u2019s record doesn\u2019t match his designation as a moderate. His first choice of home secretary was Suella Braverman. The immigration policy they co-authored took the hardline template designed by Priti Patel and hardened it. Sunak benefited from a gloss of competence carried over from his handling of the pandemic as chancellor. He acquired an aura of pragmatism by virtue of not being Truss, although they are more alike than either cares to admit. Both are Thatcher fetishists. Both put their faith in tax cuts to generate prosperity and reject the idea that government should engineer a fair distribution of the proceeds. The main difference is that Truss provoked a global market recoil by refusing to say how a shortfall in revenue would be recouped. Sunak has that angle notionally covered with a plan for sustained, eye-watering budget austerity. The ideological alignment is explicit in a recording of comments Jeremy Hunt recently made to a Conservative audience. He said he \u201cset out to achieve some of the same things\u201d as Truss, but on a more gradual trajectory. He also praised the former prime minister for \u201caccepting the mistakes she had made with good grace.\u201d If so, she must have done this in private, because her public account of what went wrong is an unrepentant, self-pitying conspiracy theory about deep-state sabotage. The chancellor is no stranger to the craft of making moderate excuses for wild notions. In the 2019 leadership contest, Hunt was notionally the sensible alternative to Johnson in the final round. On the big issue of the moment, he took the view that Britain could crash out of the EU without a deal, and pick up the pieces afterwards. Johnson denied that there would be any breakage to repair, and won easily. That was the Rubicon for realist Tory MPs of the old school. They knew a no-deal Brexit would be a calamity. They knew Johnson was a compulsive liar. The few who put up resistance \u2013 voting to allow the Commons to seize control of the Brexit timetable \u2013 were purged. The party of Ken Clarke, Philip Hammond, David Gauke, Dominic Grieve, Rory Stewart and others was driven into exile. To continue being a Conservative meant signing up for Boris fandom and the cult of Brexit rapture. Some were guided by conviction, others by ambition and inertia. The subsequent landslide election victory vindicated the Johnsonian method: campaign against economic gravity; suffocate awkward choices in an ideological comfort blanket. Now gravity is having its revenge and many Tory candidates pine for the old giddy weightlessness. They forget public revulsion over Partygate. They solicit Johnson\u2019s endorsement as if he is the missing fuel to get their grounded campaigns airborne. They invoke the old \u201cBoris effect\u201d as the only force capable of rivalling Farage at voter magnetism. But the voters they have in mind are not the ones that can keep the Tories in power. Since 2019, about 1.7 million people have switched allegiance from Conservative to Labour. It is a vast electoral swing, one of the largest on record. Downing Street has given up even trying to reverse it. These are people who tell pollsters their biggest concerns are the cost of living and crumbling public services. Tax cuts are at the bottom of the list. Some have voted Tory in every election since 2005. Johnson\u2019s malfeasance drove many away; Truss provoked an exodus. Sunak has nothing to say that can win them back. He is fishing in the pool of voters who say they won\u2019t vote at all or are leaning to Reform. But he also doesn\u2019t want to demean himself by actively repudiating Farage\u2019s agenda. He picked the fight but now won\u2019t stoop to making the argument. It isn\u2019t even clear what that would sound like. The prime minister who made \u201cstop the boats\u201d his mantra is not going to denounce Reform\u2019s sinister fixation on repelling migrants. Nor can Sunak ridicule Farage\u2019s phoney budget figures that pretend vast tax cuts can be afforded by scrapping chunks of the state. That doubles as a caricature of his own manifesto. Then, of course, there is the ultimate taboo \u2013 beware the charlatan who prescribed Brexit as a national tonic and now comes peddling the old poison in new bottles. No Tory can say that now and none will say it after the election. Not even the moderates who think it. They know they can\u2019t regain control of their party by declaring their heresies aloud. But because they are heretics at heart, they can never sound authentic in espousing the post-Brexit creed. There will be some bitter arguments and an ugly blame game after the election. But it isn\u2019t really going to amount to a Tory civil war or anything as grand as a battle for the soul of the party. Civil wars need two armies equally committed to the fight. When one side adopts all the terms and conditions dictated by the other, it\u2019s called a surrender. And if there were enough moderates capable of winning a struggle for the Conservative soul, it might not have been sold in the first place.

            "title": "Berlin by rail: a cold-war adventure",
            "date": "2024-06-20T06:00:29Z",
            "content": "Eagle-eyed football fans heading to Berlin\u2019s Olympiastadion for the Euros may spot what looks like an abandoned space station topped with four enormous white orbs on a hill a mile or so south of the ground. The stadium \u2013 which will host the Euro 2024 final \u2013 has a more storied past than perhaps any other. Built by the Nazis for the 1936 Berlin Olympics, the great African American sprinter Jesse Owens won four gold medals here in front of a watching Adolf Hitler, single-handedly debunking the F\u00fchrer\u2019s myth of Aryan supremacy. But the weird sci-fi-looking building nearby has an even more fascinating history. Teufelsberg (Devil\u2019s Mountain) is a manmade hill eight miles west of the city centre, created from 25 million cubic metres of second world war Berlin rubble that was piled on top of a Nazi military academy to form the highest point in the city. Then, at the height of the cold war, US intelligence agencies built a hilltop listening station on Teufelsberg to intercept East German and Soviet communication. The station\u2019s towers and enormous antenna radomes \u2013 those white domes that resemble giant golf balls which protected the radars \u2013 are almost comically eerie. I\u2019m in Berlin with my 15-year-old son, George, and we take the S-Bahn out to Grunewald, then hike up through the forest to Teufelsberg. After German reunification, the hill fell into disrepair and is now a weird and wonderful canvas for street artists. We climb the listening station tower to take in stunning views of the Berlin skyline and what is one of the world\u2019s largest street art galleries, with more than 400 murals by artists from all over the world. It feels like an abandoned set from Dr Strangelove that\u2019s been reclaimed by graffiti artists. George thinks the whole place is \u201cvery cool but a bit bonkers\u201d. We\u2019re in Berlin to explore the city\u2019s enthralling cold war legacy. Like most teenagers, George has to be dragged around ancient landmarks, however momentous (on a recent trip to Pompeii he declared himself officially bored 30 minutes in), but loves exploring anywhere with a more relatable modern history. (Two of our best trips have been on the Beatles\u2019 trail in Liverpool and a tour of political murals and the Bloody Sunday march in Northern Ireland.) So where better to take a teenager than Berlin, epicentre of 20th-century European history? As well as kid-friendly favourites like the Wall and Checkpoint Charlie, there is lots of \u201cnew\u201d cold war history to explore. And equally important for a teenager, it is one of the coolest cities in the world, packed with great shops, markets and \u201cedgy\u201d neighbourhoods. We\u2019ve come on the train from London, and as the overnight sleeper pulls into Gesundbrunnen station, it is still dark, deserted and shrouded in a pre-dawn mist \u2013 such a broodingly atmospheric welcome to the city, it feels made to order for our cold war adventure. The European Sleeper we\u2019re on (it starts in Brussels and was recently extended to Dresden and Prague) feels like an Eastern bloc relic, too. The carriages were built in the 1950s and 60s and are full of Soviet era \u201cquirks\u201d: the doors of the compartment don\u2019t fully close, the heating is on full-blast all night, and the curtains look as if they went up before the Wall. But the duvets are soft, the berths comfortable and we\u2019re rocked to sleep as the train trundles through the night from Amsterdam to Berlin. (For travellers who would rather connect in Paris, and travel in something less retro, a new Nightjet sleeper route links the French and German capitals.) On our first day we take in the Reichstag and walk through the mighty Brandenburg Gate on the way to the new Cold War Museum, which brings the era to life through a series of gripping virtual reality tours. The first takes us back to the seminal moment when Berlin was literally split in two, right down the middle of Bernauer Strasse, which we\u2019re standing in here. The story is told through the eyes and words of a terrified East German soldier; we hear him agonising over his future in a divided Germany: should he stay or go? In a heart-stopping moment, he deserts his post and leaps from east to west over the barbed wire border and into another country. Nowhere in the city emanates history like Tempelhof airport. Designed by the Nazis to be the world\u2019s largest airport and a showcase of power, it was never completed, but still played a pivotal role in both the second world war and the Berlin airlift in the late 1940s. If we\u2019d stood here in 1948, the air would have been thick with American, French and British aircraft (a plane landed here every 45 seconds at times) airlifting food and fuel into West Berlin after Stalin had blockaded the western outpost. To celebrate the centenary of its 1923 opening, an elegant wooden terrace has been added, giving access to the airport\u2019s original control tower and views of the city centre. Since the airport closed in 2008, the runways have been turned into Tempelhofer Feld, one of the world\u2019s largest city parks, and we look out from the control tower on hundreds of cyclists, skaters, runners, dog walkers, revellers and families enjoying picnics and barbecues. Like Teufelsberg\u2019s ever-evolving canvas, the unfinished airport still feels like a work in progress. This is what makes Berlin so fascinating: what to do with all this living history as the city figures out where its difficult past sits in relation to its uncertain future? It\u2019s why four-metre-tall sections of Berlin Wall are still strewn about the centre: some curated in outdoor galleries or left as they were in 1989; other standalone sections are now memorials or tourist attractions; we even spot one in a junkyard, awaiting a new home. Even our hotel has a cold war legacy: you wouldn\u2019t guess it now, but the lovely Lux Eleven apart-hotel (double rooms and apartments from \u20ac106), on vibrant Rosa-Luxemburg-Strasse in Mitte, was once home to the Soviet secret service. From our window, we have a neck-wrenching view of the famous East German TV tower, a reminder that we are in the former GDR. But east Berlin isn\u2019t all about the cold war. On Karl-Marx-Allee, the showcase boulevard built by the communists after the war, the Computerspielemuseum documents the history of arcade computer games. George joins the dozens of other excited kids discovering the communal joy of 20th-century video games, including classics such as Asteroids, Space Invaders and the original Playstation. There\u2019s even an arcade machine developed in the GDR in the mid-80s: Poly-Play contains seven different games, including a Pac-Man clone. Some of the 300 games that can be played are housed in an original 1980s video arcade. Like the Berlin Wall, a 20th-century phenomenon that has been consigned to history. \u2022 The trip was supported by Visit Berlin. Rail transport from London to Amsterdam was provided by Eurostar (from \u00a339 one-way) and from Amsterdam to Berlin by the European Sleeper (couchettes from \u20ac49 one-way)."

            "title": "Russia-Ukraine war: Kremlin refuses to comment on Trump\u2019s claims he would settle war \u2013 as it happened",
            "date": "2024-06-29T14:55:29Z",
            "content": "We\u2019ll be closing this blog shortly. Here is a roundup of today\u2019s developments. The council of the EU on Saturday announced fresh sanctions against Belarus due to its involvement in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. Ten Ukrainians held prisoner for years by Russia were released with the Vatican\u2019s mediation, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced. The Kremlin refused to comment after Donald Trump has said that if re-elected in November, he will settle its war against Ukraine. Russia has lost 541,560 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion, Ukraine\u2019s armed forces reported on Saturday as part of their rolling update on casualties. At least one person was killed and 12 were injured in Dnipro, after a Russian strike destroyed the top four floors of an apartment building on Friday evening, regional head Serhii Lysak said. Ukraine has lost 80% of its thermal and a third of its hydroelectric power in Russian strikes, Zelenskiy said. Russia has taken control of village of Shumy in the Donetsk region, Russian-state media reported. Belarus has increased air defence forces along Ukraine border following rising drone activity. The council of the EU has introduced new sanctions against Belarus due to its involvement in Russia war against Ukraine. The council on Saturday adopted measures targeting the Belarusian economy, which it said aim to echo several of the sanctions already in place against Russia. The measures target trade with Belarus, as well as prohibiting the provision of certain services to the state. It will be illegal to import gold and diamonds from Belarus, as well as helium, coal and mineral products including crude oil. The move also bans the export of certain goods, including luxury products, to Belarus. It has also broadened the ban on the road transportation of goods within the EU, by trailers and semi-trailers registered in Belarus. Some images showing the aftermath of Friday\u2019s missile attack in Dnipro, where at least one person was killed and 12 injured. While the Kremlin refused to comment on Donald Trump\u2019s claims that he would settle the war, the US presidential debate was watched closely in Ukraine. Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a Ukrainian lawmaker, told the Kyiv Independent that the result looked bad for Biden. \u201cI would definitely not pay attention to some of the statements now, but the results of the debates do not look like they helped Biden. It seems to me that they have made it much worse\u2026 even within the Democratic Party,\u201d Zhelezniak told the Kyiv Independent. He added that it appeared that the odds of Trump\u2019s re-election were increasing. \u201cIt is not good that he repeats this \u2014 \u2018if he is elected president, he will resolve this issue.\u2019 To put it mildly, it probably won\u2019t be on Ukraine\u2019s terms,\u201d Zhelezhiak added. Oleksandr Kraiev, an international relations analyst at the foreign policy thinktank Ukrainian Prism, described the overall debate as \u201cvery depressing\u201d. \u201cIn terms of information and narrative saturation, none of them showed any real class \u2014 one because of fatigue, the other because of lies,\u201d Kraiev said on social media. Reuters reports that Belarus has deployed additional air defence forces to its border with Ukraine to protect \u201ccritical infrastructure facilities\u201d due to increased Ukrainian drone activity in the area, a Belarusian military commander said on Saturday. Belarus, an ally of Russia in the war with Ukraine, said earlier this week it had shot down a quadcopter that had illegally crossed the border from Ukraine \u201cto collect information about the Belarusian border infrastructure\u201d. The situation in the airspace over the border remains tense, Andrei Severinchik, commander of the Belarusian Air Defence Forces, said on Saturday. \u201cWe are ready to decisively use all available forces and means to protect our territory and the population of the Republic of Belarus from possible provocations in the airspace,\u201d he said in a statement published on the Defence Ministry\u2019s Telegram channel. The Defence Ministry said earlier on Saturday it had information showing Ukraine had been moving more troops, weapons and military equipment to the northern Zhytomyr region, which borders Belarus. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine. After Russia took the village of Shumy in the Donetsk region, let\u2019s take a step back and look at the bigger picture of how the war is progressing this summer. Russian forces are pushing through outgunned Ukrainian defences, who are struggling with insufficient manpower and have bitterly suffered the consequences of US delays in delivering military aid. Russia took advantage of these shortages to intensify attacks in several areas along the 1,000-kilometer front, the AP news agency reports. Relatively small Russian units are searching for weak spots in Ukrainian defences \u2013 and could be preparing for an expanded push. In a positive development for Ukraine, Russia\u2019s offensive near Kharkiv, the country\u2019s second biggest city, that began in May appears to be running out of steam after the Ukrainian army redeployed troops from other sectors to this section of the front. But Russia has made small but steady advances within the Donetsk region. By stretching out its army along the length of the frontline, Russia is playing to its strengths \u2013 and against the weaknesses of Ukraine, which lacks the size and training for a major offensive, Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute told AP. The breadth of the strikes has forced Ukraine to spread out its artillery, \u201cexpending munitions to break up successive Russian attacks,\u201d Watling said in an analysis. \u201cRussia\u2019s aim is not to achieve a grand breakthrough but rather to convince Ukraine that it can keep up an inexorable advance, kilometre by kilometre, along the front.\u201d Moscow also has increased the frequency of its airstrikes on Ukraine\u2019s energy facilities and other vital infrastructure, with president Volodymyr Zelenskiy saying Ukraine had lost about 80% of its thermal power and a third of its hydroelectric power in the strikes. Watling said the shortfall of air defences is forcing Ukraine to choose between safeguard critical infrastructure or protecting troops on the front. Jewish people in Dagestan have vowed to regroup and rebuild following the deadly attacks on Jewish and Christian houses of worship by Islamic militants in two cities in the north Caucasus region last weekend. The attacks in the regional capital of Makhachkala and the city of Derbent on Sunday killed 21 people and injured at least 43 others. The Associated Press reports that Chief Rabbi of Russia Berel Lazar said a 110-year-old Derbent synagogue was destroyed in a fire during the attacks. Among those slain was the Rev. Nikolai Kotelnikov, a 66-year-old Russian Orthodox priest who was killed as the faithful gathered on Pentecost, also known as Trinity Sunday, at a church in Derbent. \u201cThe message we are getting from the Jewish community in Dagestan is that they are not going to hide behind high walls and be intimidated by extremists,\u201d said Lazar. \u201cThey are going to practice their religion openly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are optimistic that the government will take steps to protect them. They believe they can rebuild and get stronger.\u201d Rabbi Lazar said a majority of Dagestan\u2019s Muslim population still has a good relationship with Jews and is dismayed by Sunday\u2019s attacks. \u201cThis was not just an attack on Jews, but also on churches, the state and all people,\u201d he said. \u201cMost Muslims in Dagestan are also worried about this new wave of extremism. But we know that this is coming from outside the country and a very small percentage of Muslims are influenced by such ideology.\u201d Russia has taken control of village of Shumy in the Donetsk region, Russian-state media reports. Citing the country\u2019s ministry of defence, Russian state-owned news agency Ria reported on Saturday that the army had seized control of the settlement, which is near the city of Toretsk. It claimed that Ukrainian suffered 360 casualties. The Guardian has not verified this. At least one person was killed and 12 were injured in Dnipro, after a Russian strike destroyed the top four floors of an apartment building on Friday evening, regional head Serhii Lysak said. The attacks came as Russia intensifies airstrikes in a bid to drain Ukraine\u2019s resources, often targeting energy facilities and other vital infrastructure, the Associated Press reported. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his country had lost about 80% of its thermal power and a third of its hydroelectric power in Russian strikes. He said the attack in Dnipro showed that Ukraine needed more air defense systems. The Ukrainian air force said on Saturday that it had downed 10 Russian drones overnight. This is why we constantly remind all of our partners: only a sufficient amount of high-quality of air defense systems, only a sufficient amount of determination from the world at large can stop Russian terror,\u201d he said. Kyiv has also struck back at Russia with its own aerial attacks, also often targeting energy infrastructure. Here are some photos from Toretsk in Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region, from where civilians are being evacuated. The city has become a strategic target for Russian troops that shell it so often and are getting closer each day. Russian attacks on residential areas in the eastern Donetsk region have killed four civilians and wounded six over the past day, Donetsk governor Vadym Filashkin said. Most of the casualties took place in Niu-York, a village on the frontline that has been under fire since 2014, Filashkin said on Telegram. The Ukrainian authorities are urging civilians remaining in frontline areas like Niu-York \u2013 which is less than five kilometres from the front \u2013 to evacuate. Further casualties were reported in the southern Kherson region, where one civilian was killed, and two were wounded during the morning attacks, according to the local authorities. In the northeastern Kharkiv region, one person was killed, and nine were wounded over the past day, according to the region\u2019s governor Oleh Syniehubov. Russia has lost 541,560 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion, Ukraine\u2019s armed forces reported on Saturday as part of their rolling update on casualties. This number includes 1,070 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day, according to the Ukrainian army. It also reported that Russia has lost the following military resources and weaponry since its invasion began: 8,073 tanks, 15,505 armored fighting vehicles, 19,568 vehicles and fuel tanks, 14,480 artillery systems, 1,109 multiple launch rocket systems, 871 air defense systems, 360 airplanes, 326 helicopters, 11,538 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine. As a new recruitment drive looms, some Ukrainian men are turning to online handlers and forgers to escape the horror of war. Attempts to flee the country are expected to increase after Ukraine\u2019s recent adoption of new sweeping mobilisation measures, which allow the military to call up more soldiers and impose stricter penalties for draft evasion. I am not made for war. I can\u2019t kill people, even if they are Russians. I won\u2019t last long on the front \u2026 I want to build a family and see the world. I am not ready to die,\u201d Dmytro, 31-year-old Ukrainian, said. As the number of available soldiers dwindles, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, last April signed a controversial law that lowered the mobilisation age from 27 to 25. Under the new guidelines, draft evaders can lose their driving licence, have their bank accounts frozen and property seized. A Ukrainian drone has killed five people in Russia\u2019s borderline Kursk region, the Russian state-owned news agency Tass news agency reported on Saturday, citing Kursk governor Alexey Smirnov. \u201cTonight, a Ukrainian copter attacked a residential building in the village of Gorodishche, Rylsky district. Unfortunately, 5 people died as a result of the discharge, including 2 small children. \u201cTwo more family members were taken to the Rylsk regional hospital in serious condition, where they are receiving medical care. I offer my deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims,\u201d Smirnov wrote on Telegram. The Guardian has not independently verified the report. Both sides have used drones extensively throughout the conflict which began in February 2022. Ten Ukrainians held prisoner for years by Russia have been released with the Vatican\u2019s mediation, president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced on Friday. The Associated Press reported that part of the group arrived overnight at Kyiv International Airport \u2013 the first passengers the airport has received in over two years. The rest of the group arrived by bus. Among the freed was Nariman Dzhelyal, the deputy head of the Mejlis, a representative body of Crimean Tatars that was relocated to Kyiv after Russia seized Crimea. After Vladimir Putin\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, Crimean Tatars were persecuted using harassment, arrests and disappearances. Moscow banned the Mejlis, declaring it an extremist organisation, and it has jailed members of the community since, citing security concerns. Dzhelyal was taken from Crimea, where he lived despite the annexation, one year before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \u201cI was in captivity, where many Ukrainians remain,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot leave them there, because the conditions, both psychological and physical, are very frightening there.\u201d According to Ukraine\u2019s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, 3,310 Ukrainians have been released from Russian captivity. But many thousands, both civilians and military personnel, are still imprisoned. Although the Kremlin refused to comment on Donald Trump\u2019s claims that he would end the Russia-Ukraine war, Russian state media state media reported on the debate in detail, honing in on Joe Biden\u2019s weak performance and Trump\u2019s remarks on settling the conflict. The Kremlin downplayed the significance of the event. \u201cI don\u2019t think you expect the president of Russia might set an alarm clock, wake up before morning and watch the debates in the United States of America,\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked if he had watched the debate, adding: \u201cDebates in the United States are not part of the main issues on the agenda.\u201d But while the Kremlin affected an unbothered stance on the event, which later saw president Biden acknowledge his shaky performance, Russian state news honed in on it. In its coverage of the debate, state news agency RIA included a tally of how many times the candidates mentioned the name \u201cVladimir Putin\u201d (seven times for both) and Russia (Trump: 16, Biden: 0). State media also shared the results of a CNN poll showing that two-thirds of US voters believe Trump won the debate. Several Russian media outlets also published stories on Trump\u2019s comments that \u201cUkraine\u2019s not winning that war\u201d because of Biden \u201cand his stupid decisions\u201d. Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s Ukraine blog. The local time in Kyiv is 10:42am. The Kremlin has refused to comment after Donald Trump has said that if re-elected in November, he will settle its war against Ukraine. Trump made the remarks during Thursday\u2019s US presidential debate, where he and president Joe Biden competed to appear tougher on foreign policy. \u201cAs far as Russia and Ukraine, if we had a real president, a president that knew \u2013 that was respected by Putin, he would have never \u2013 he would have never invaded Ukraine,\u201d Trump said. Biden responded: \u201cGo ahead, let Putin go in and control Ukraine, and then move on to Poland and other places. See what happens then. He has no idea what the hell he\u2019s talking about.\u201d More on that in a bit. Meanwhile, the following developments have been reported: A Russian missile strike hit a nine-storey residential building in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Friday, killing at least one person and injuring six others, officials said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said 10 civilians including a politician and two priests taken prisoner in Russia and Belarus had been freed in a deal mediated by the Vatican. Russia\u2019s defence ministry claimed its forces had taken control of the settlement of Rozdolivka in eastern Ukraine, but the Ukrainian military said heavy fighting was raging in areas around the settlement. The Biden administration will provide Ukraine with $150m worth of weapons and ammunition, including Hawk air defence interceptors and 155mm artillery munitions, two US officials said. We\u2019ll bring you more updates and context as the day unfolds."

            "date": "2024-06-01T10:00:35Z",
            "content": "This year the Bilderberg summit, now under way in Madrid, turned 70 years old. But the controversial and secretive gathering of the world\u2019s elites shows no signs of slowing down. For decades the Bilderberg meeting, where the rich and the powerful gather behind closed doors to talk about what ails the world, has been the subject \u2013 understandably \u2013 of conspiracy theories. In recent years, Bilderberg has sought to remake itself and open up a little: more Davos than Illuminati. But it still raises hackles from many observers. Its beady eyes, twinkling with billionaires, are this year fixed firmly on the future. Specifically, the \u201cfuture of warfare\u201d. And with conflicts raging from Sudan to Ukraine to Gaza, it feels like it is the spirit of the age. This grim subject is being thrashed out under the hum of police drones hovering over the hotel, making sure such luminaries as the king of the Netherlands and the head of Nato are safe inside. Even by Bilderberg standards, the security at this year\u2019s conference is intense, but it managed to gear up even more when the Spanish king\u2019s entourage swept into the venue past a traffic jam of police vans. The heightened security is perhaps a reflection of the threats and \u201cchallenges\u201d packed into the conference agenda: Russia, China, the Middle East, the climate \u2013 while the session on Ukraine, titled Ukraine and the World, has a worrying hint of a wider world war. And when the topic of the Changing Faces of Biology is being discussed by the CEO of Pfizer, the head of the EU Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and the man who led the Human Genome Project, you can almost hear the alarm bells over the police sirens. The world of Bilderberg in 2024 throbs with threats; it\u2019s what conference participant Alexander Stubb, the president of Finland, recently described as \u201cthe weaponisation of everything\u201d. It\u2019s a world of \u201chybrid attacks\u201d driven by disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence. There\u2019s even a session on AI safety at this year\u2019s gathering, one of two sessions devoted to AI, securing its place at the head of Bilderberg\u2019s agenda. The conference hall is heaving with tech luminaries, including the heads of Google DeepMind, Microsoft AI, Mistral AI and Anthropic, making the event a high-level AI summit in its own right. Many of these AI chiefs are tech optimists; Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, recently raved about AI \u201cspreading consciousness to the stars\u201d. But the contingent of US national security officials, who have flowed in from Washington for these talks, tend to take a more worldly and weaponised view of the subject. They\u2019re led by the deputy national security adviser, Jonathan Finer, and Jen Easterly, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. They are joined by one of the US\u2019s most senior soldiers, the supreme allied commander Europe, Christopher Cavoli, who warned recently that the conflict with Russia was shaping up to be a \u201clong fight\u201d. So the immediate future of war sounds like it\u2019ll be more war. It\u2019s just sad that Henry Kissinger isn\u2019t here to enjoy it. The elder statesman of Bilderberg died in November at the age of 100. Certainly the world\u2019s military \u2013 and the industries that surround it \u2013 take Bilderberg seriously. Gen Cavoli is taking time out from leading a \u201cwholesale modernization\u201d of Nato\u2019s defense capabilities to attend the Madrid conference. His boss at Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, is attending his last Bilderberg as secretary general. His successor is hotly tipped to be Mark Rutte, the outgoing Dutch prime minister. Rutte is a Bilderberg regular, and doubtless the group will be delighted, though perhaps not surprised, if yet another of their charmed circle lands a top job. The other prime minister here in Madrid is Estonia\u2019s Kaja Kallas, who said recently that \u201copenness is our greatest weapon\u201d in free societies. \u201cAt its core,\u201d she said, \u201copenness represents getting rid of barriers that hinder the flow of information.\u201d Sadly, we won\u2019t know if she talks at Bilderberg about openness, because of all the barriers hindering the flow of information. We do know that Kallas believes that on the battlefield, \u201cUkraine has out-innovated Russia, fielding entirely new weapons systems\u201d \u2013 some of which will have been developed by the tech companies at this year\u2019s conference. Time magazine has dubbed Ukraine \u201can AI war lab\u201d, and the Economist agrees, describing it as \u201ca testing ground for companies like Anduril and Palantir\u201d \u2013 the heads of both of these defense tech companies are here in Madrid. The founder of Anduril Industries is Palmer Luckey, the designer of Oculus VR, who got bored of making headsets and wanted to build autonomous combat vehicles instead \u2013 so in 2017 he set up the defense contractor Anduril Industries, with investment from Founders Fund, which is run by the venture capitalist and Bilderberg insider Peter Thiel. Another of Thiel\u2019s happy investments was in Palantir \u2013 the AI surveillance giant run by Alex Karp, who sits alongside his mentor, Thiel, on Bilderberg\u2019s steering committee. War is a fantastic opportunity for R&amp;D; as Karp says: \u201cThere are things that we can do on the battlefield that we could not do in a domestic context.\u201d Meanwhile in Palestine, Palantir technology is being used by the IDF \u201cin support of war-related missions\u201d. The onslaught has been excellent for the company\u2019s bottom line. \u201cOur products have been in great demand,\u201d enthuses Karp. Karp\u2019s fellow Bilderberg insider and Pentagon favourite Eric Schmidt, who used to run Google, is said by Forbes magazine to have been so \u201cinspired by Ukraine\u2019s use of drones on the battlefield\u201d that he has spent the past year \u201cworking on a secret military drone project\u201d. But for now, if Ukraine is to win the drone war, Schmidt says that it needs \u201csustained financial and technical support from Kyiv\u2019s allies\u201d. This sentiment will surely be echoed by Ukraine\u2019s representative at the Madrid conference, the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who will no doubt be doing his best to coax some extra billions out of the crowd. This year\u2019s Bilderberg is thick with senior ministers and EU commissioners, not to mention the heads of the European Investment Bank and the Bank of Spain. The event itself is being hosted by Ana Bot\u00edn, the executive chair of Banco Santander, and the heads of numerous other finance giants are attending, including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and Societ\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Big business tends to pick up the tab for Bilderberg, because it\u2019s such a high-end investment opportunity. Bilderberg is the boardroom of the western alliance, so they get to participate in the shaping of the grand strategy and hopefully get a jump on the market. It\u2019s looking like next year\u2019s host will be the Swedish billionaire investor Marcus Wallenberg, the chairman of defense company Saab. His senior adviser, Oscar Stenstr\u00f6m, has been hovering round the venue as a member of the conference \u201cpre-team\u201d. Stenstr\u00f6m was the chief negotiator for Sweden\u2019s successful accession to Nato in March, and what better way to toast the ongoing expansion of the Alliance than with a Scandinavian Bilderberg.

            "date": "2024-06-12T07:05:50Z",
            "content": "The US has said it is \u201cevaluating\u201d Hamas\u2019 formal response to its Gaza ceasefire proposal, as the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, attempts to channel global support for a UN security council resolution backing the proposal into pressure on the Palestinian militant group and Israel. Late on Tuesday, a Hamas official said they had submitted a response to Egyptian and Qatari mediators, seeking some \u201camendments\u201d, and that their priority was to bring a \u201ccomplete stop\u201d to the war. A separate Hamas spokesperson, Jihad Taha, said the response included \u201camendments that confirm the ceasefire, withdrawal, reconstruction and [prisoner] exchange\u201d. Washington received the reply and was \u201cevaluating it right now,\u201d national security council spokesperson John Kirby told journalists on Tuesday night, while declining to provide details on its content. Blinken on Wednesday heads to Qatar, which along with Egypt is a key mediator with Hamas. On his second day of a visit to the Middle East on Tuesday, he said Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had \u201creaffirmed his commitment\u201d to the proposal, although the Israeli government, which has far-right members, has not formally endorsed it. Blinken met Israeli opposition leaders on Tuesday morning, and spoke privately to hostages\u2019 families before travelling to Jordan for an emergency summit on humanitarian aid for Gaza, where more than a million people are on the brink of famine and most of the population are displaced. He announced an extra $404m (\u00a3317m) funding for humanitarian aid for Gaza at the conference, and called on other countries to step up donations. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, said the international community had a responsibility to press Israel to open land crossings into Gaza. His Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, said international pressure was needed to stop Israel using hunger as a weapon. The deal, which was approved by the UN on Monday, was unveiled by the US president, Joe Biden, at the end of May. Biden presented it as an Israeli initiative although Netanyahu has been at best ambivalent about the plan, saying any ceasefire proposal before Hamas military and governance capacity had been destroyed was a \u201cnon-starter\u201d. That position appears to contradict the terms of the agreement, which calls for an initial exchange of elderly, sick or female hostages for Palestinian detainees held by Israel, in the course of a first six-week halt to fighting. The ceasefire would evolve into a permanent end to hostilities and the release of all hostages in a second phase. A final stage would see the launch of a major reconstruction effort. Hamas\u2019s position could also complicate progress. It has said it would only accept a permanent ceasefire deal, after one temporary break in fighting collapsed last winter, and reportedly asked for international guarantees of any ceasefire. Senior officials from the group on Tuesday welcomed the resolution and said it was ready to negotiate details. A spokesperson, Jihad Taha, said Israel was \u201cstalling and procrastinating and creating obstacles\u201d so it could continue fighting. The UN vote on Monday was the first time a deeply divided security council has endorsed a comprehensive plan for Gaza. Palestinian support for the US resolution made it much harder diplomatically for Russia or China to veto it. The rare show of relative unity puts pressure on both parties to the conflict, though both have shown themselves to be far more influenced by local constituencies and the personal interests of leaders than by international public opinion. Netanyahu\u2019s government has shifted to the right since Biden unveiled the deal, with the war cabinet member Benny Gantz resigning from the government over the failure to make a long-term plan for Gaza. That has increased the weight of hardline extremists, who want to keep fighting and have said they would resign if Netanyahu accepted a deal. However, the prime minister is also under pressure over the fate of hostages still in Gaza, whose relatives are lobbying hard for Israel to accept the deal. They demonstrated outside Blinken\u2019s hotel in Tel Aviv, and he also met hostages\u2019 families. Four hostages were rescued at the weekend by Israeli special forces, in a mission that killed more than 270 Palestinians, many of them civilians, prompting international outrage at what the top EU diplomat, Josep Borrell, called a \u201cmassacre\u201d. The UN human rights office said it was \u201cshocked\u201d by the impact on civilians of the rescue operation, and warned that Israeli forces and Hamas may both have committed war crimes. The operation brought the total freed in military operations to just seven, a tiny proportion of the 250 people captured in the Hamas cross-border attacks on 7 October, when militants also killed about 1,200 Israelis. Relatives say military operations cannot free all their loved ones. Most of those who are now home were handed over under a temporary ceasefire deal last November. There are still 120 held in Gaza, at least a third of whom are presumed to have died. In Gaza there was scepticism that the deal would bring a halt to Israeli attacks that have killed more than 37,000 people, according to health authorities in the strip, and brought at least half the population to the brink of famine. \u201cWe will believe it only when we see it,\u201d said Shaban Abdel-Raouf, 47, displaced with his family of five to the central town of Deir al-Balah. \u201cWhen they tell us to pack our belongings and prepare to go back to Gaza City, we will know it is true,\u201d he told Reuters. Four Israeli soldiers were killed there in an ambush on Tuesday, Israeli media reported. Forty Palestinians were killed in Gaza over the last 24 hours, and 120 injured, Gaza health authorities said. Fears of escalating conflict between Hezbollah and Israeli forces across the northern border were also on Blinken\u2019s agenda in Israel. Late on Monday Israeli forces killed three fighters when they hit a convoy of tankers, and on Tuesday Hezbollah fired a barrage of about 50 projectiles towards the Golan Heights. Blinken told Gantz that the ceasefire deal for Gaza would improve Israel\u2019s security by taming tensions on that border, the US state department said."

            "title": "Pressure grows on Benjamin Netanyahu to back Gaza ceasefire plan",
            "date": "2024-06-04T17:34:08Z",
            "content": "Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is facing growing pressure at home and internationally to support a new ceasefire plan for Gaza, a move he is resisting over fears it will collapse his government. Far-right members of the prime minister\u2019s coalition have threatened to quit the coalition if Israel \u201csurrenders\u201d before \u201ctotal victory\u201d over Hamas, while his leading rival, the centrist Benny Gantz, has said he will resign from the emergency unity government if Netanyahu does not commit to a deal and \u201cday after\u201d plan for Gaza by 8 June. Staying in office is Netanyahu\u2019s best chance of evading prosecution for corruption on charges he denies. But the longtime leader was forced into a corner on Friday, when Joe Biden unveiled a new truce and hostage release plan, which he said was an Israeli proposal. In the unexpected announcement, Biden urged Hamas to come to the table \u2013 but the speech, which was not coordinated in advance with Israeli officials, is widely believed to have been aimed at reluctant elements of the Israeli leadership, too. Netanyahu almost immediately undermined the US president, on Saturday calling the plan a \u201cnon-starter\u201d. He has since begrudgingly acknowledged the new proposal, which has been relayed to Hamas, but also reportedly reassured his political partners that \u201cthe war would not end and the chances of reaching a deal were very low\u201d. After several failed rounds of talks, a second ceasefire following a week-long truce that collapsed in November is still far from certain. Qatar, a mediator, said on Tuesday that it was still waiting for a \u201cclear position\u201d from Israel, while a Hamas spokesperson said the group could not agree to a deal in which Israel did not commit to a permanent ceasefire and complete withdrawal from Gaza. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any statements on both sides that give us a lot of confidence,\u201d said the Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari, who also noted that \u201cthe process is progressing and we have been working with both sides on proposals on the table\u201d. But there is a growing sense in Israel \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 that Netanyahu is running out of options. \u201cHe is world champion at stalling, making all sides sick of him and ultimately evading paying the bill when it comes due,\u201d the commentator Ben Caspit wrote in the centrist Israeli daily Ma\u2019ariv on Tuesday. But even a political master such as Netanyahu couldn\u2019t hold off much longer on making a decision on a deal, Caspit said. \u201cHe has to make a real decision. Not a sort-of decision, not a pretend decision, not an on-condition decision and not a temporary decision. A decision.\u201d During Saturday night\u2019s now-weekly protest in Tel Aviv led by the families of hostages held by Hamas, thousands of people called on the government to act on the new proposal, as well as for new elections. On Tuesday, the Shas party, Netanyahu\u2019s ultra-Orthodox coalition partner, came out in favour of the deal, adding to pressure from the leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid, who has promised that his centrist party will help a deal pass in the Knesset even if rightwing government factions rebel. And after months of increasing international isolation and souring relations with the US, Israel\u2019s most important ally, Biden has for the first time appeared to accuse the Israeli leader of prolonging the war effort in Gaza for his own political survival. Asked in an interview with Time magazine, published on Tuesday, whether the Israeli leader was stalling for political reasons, Biden said: \u201cThere is every reason for people to draw that conclusion.\u201d An editorial in the leftwing daily Haaretz on Tuesday speculated that the prime minister, faced with nothing but unpalatable choices, could play a card he has used several times in the recent past: dissolving parliament and taking his chances in new elections. As head of a transition government, he could go ahead with the hostage and ceasefire deal without the fear of losing his far-right partners\u2019 support. Getting back in Washington\u2019s good books would reopen the pathway to a potential legacy-defining normalisation deal with Saudi Arabia. It would also delay decisions on another politically explosive issue dividing Netanyahu\u2019s current coalition: ultra-Orthodox conscription. If, as expected, elections are held sooner than the scheduled date of 2026, it is not impossible that Netanyahu could again cobble together a coalition. The prime minister has recovered in the polls since 7 October. One survey, conducted a few weeks afterwards, found just 4% of Israel\u2019s Jewish public trusted him. Most polling shows that while the majority of Israelis support the war effort, they also blame him for security failures during the Hamas attack. However, new survey data released this week by Israel\u2019s public broadcaster found the gap with Gantz, his centrist rival, is closing, with Netanyahu now eight points behind. \u201cBibi knows he will face elections at some point in the near future, so maybe he will calculate it\u2019s better for him to be in control of the process so he can create the best possible conditions and situation for himself going into an election,\u201d said Dahlia Scheindlin, a Tel Aviv-based political analyst, using Netanyahu\u2019s well-known moniker. A Ramadan ceasefire that Biden said was \u201cvery close\u201d did not materialise, and some progress towards a new truce last month was scuppered by the launch of Israel\u2019s invasion of Rafah, the last pocket of Gaza to have been spared ground fighting. There is one substantial difference between the new plan and previous proposals. The first phase, a six-week ceasefire in which a limited number of Israeli hostages would be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, would be indefinitely extendable while negotiators thrash out the next stage, so an impasse would not necessarily trigger a return to hostilities."

            "date": "2024-06-02T16:14:34Z",
            "content": "Benjamin Netanyahu is once again trying to balance the demands of centrist and far-right members of his government after a threat from his extremist allies to collapse the coalition if Israel moves forward with a new ceasefire plan for Gaza announced by the US president, Joe Biden. In an unexpected broadcast from the White House on Friday night, Biden urged Hamas to accept what he said was a new proposal from Israel for a three-phrase plan towards a permanent ceasefire in the nine-month war. \u201cIsrael has made their proposal. Hamas says they want a ceasefire. This deal is an opportunity to prove whether they really mean it. Hamas needs to take the deal,\u201d he said. But in remarks on Saturday, Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, immediately undermined Biden, reiterating that Israel seeks the complete destruction of the Palestinian militant group before it will agree to ending the war. Any deviation from that condition is a \u201cnon-starter\u201d, he said. Hamas provisionally welcomed the president\u2019s announcement, although it also said as recently as Thursday that it still views a full withdrawal of Israeli troops as a precondition to talks. Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera: \u201cBiden\u2019s speech included positive ideas, but we want this to materialise within the framework of a comprehensive agreement that meets our demands.\u201d As expected, Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition partners \u2013 the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, and the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir \u2013 immediately voiced opposition to the new truce plan when Shabbat ended on Saturday night, threatening to resign if it goes ahead. Such a deal would be \u201cfoolhardy, constituting a victory for terrorism and a threat to Israel\u2019s national security,\u201d Ben-Gvir, the head of the ultranationalist Jewish Power party, said on X. An aide to the prime minister confirmed on Sunday that Israel had put the framework forward, but described it as \u201cflawed\u201d and in need of more work. However, Netanyahu is also under increasing pressure from his military and intelligence chiefs, as well as the centrist members of his war cabinet, to accept a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Benny Gantz, a leading rival who joined Netanyahu\u2019s emergency unity government after 7 October, has said he will resign if the prime minister does not commit to a \u201cday after\u201d plan for Gaza by 8 June. Yair Lapid, Israel\u2019s opposition leader, also urged Netanyahu to agree to a hostage and ceasefire deal, saying his centrist Yesh Atid party would support it even if rightwing factions in the government rebelled \u2013 meaning a deal would be likely to pass in parliament. \u201cThe government of Israel cannot ignore President Biden\u2019s consequential speech. There is a deal on the table and it should be made,\u201d he said on Saturday. Netanyahu, long plagued by corruption charges he denies, sees staying in office as his best chance of avoiding prosecution, as well as putting off investigations and hearings into the security failures that contributed to Hamas\u2019s 7 October assault. During Saturday night\u2019s now-weekly protest in Tel Aviv led by the families of hostages held by Hamas, thousands of people called on the government to act on the new proposal. A joint statement from ceasefire mediators the US, Egypt and Qatar said the three countries \u201cjointly call on both Hamas and Israel to finalise the agreement \u2026 [to] bring immediate relief both to the longsuffering people of Gaza as well as the longsuffering hostages and their families\u201d. Despite Biden\u2019s description of the peace deal as an Israeli proposal, the president\u2019s speech \u2013 his most pointed call to date for the war to end \u2013 appeared to be designed to pressure the Israeli government into coming to the table, as well as Hamas. On Sunday, the White House national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said in an interview with ABC News: \u201cWe have every expectation that if Hamas agrees to the proposal as was transmitted to them, an Israeli proposal \u2013 then Israel would say yes.\u201d In his remarks on Friday, Biden anticipated rightwing opposition to a deal, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve urged the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal despite whatever pressure comes \u2026 Think of what will happen if this moment is lost. \u201cLose this moment, [and continue] an indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory will only bog down Israel and Gaza and further Israel\u2019s isolation in the world.\u201d Gershon Baskin, an Israeli peace activist and former negotiator with Hamas, told the Associated Press: \u201cIt was a very good speech \u2026 It seems that Biden is trying to force it on the Israeli government. He was clearly speaking directly to the Israeli people.\u201d Friday\u2019s announcement is the third \u201clast-ditch\u201d ceasefire proposal endorsed by the US: in February, a Ramadan ceasefire that Biden said was \u201cvery close\u201d did not materialise, and some progress towards a new truce last month was scuppered by the launch of Israel\u2019s invasion of Rafah, the last pocket of Gaza to be spared ground fighting. There is only one substantial difference between the new plan and previous proposals: the first phrase, which is a six-week ceasefire in which a limited number of Israeli hostages would be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, would be indefinitely extendable while negotiators thrash out the next stage. In phase two, all remaining hostages would be released, Israel would completely withdraw from Gaza, and both parties would commit to a lasting truce. The third phrase is supposed to implement as-yet unspecified plans for Gaza\u2019s future, including administration and reconstruction. About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in Hamas\u2019s assault on 7 October, with a further 250 taken hostage: about 100 were released in a week-long ceasefire in November. More than 36,000 people have been killed by Israel in the war in Gaza \u2013 according to the Palestinian health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths \u2013 which has decimated the strip\u2019s infrastructure, displaced 85% of the population from their homes and created a dire humanitarian crisis. Israel\u2019s decision to invade Rafah last month has significantly disrupted aid deliveries, leading relief organisations to again warn of widespread famine. Biden\u2019s initial full-throated support for Israel\u2019s right to defend itself after the 7 October attack has given way to censure of the suffering and death in Gaza after widespread criticism at home over his position on the war. However, the US remains the Jewish state\u2019s most important ally and principal weapons supplier. Being seen to broker an end to the conflict in Gaza would be a foreign policy boon for the president, who is facing an uphill battle for re-election in November."

            "date": "2024-06-11T10:36:54Z",
            "content": "Good morning. A senior Hamas official has said Hamas accepts a UN security council ceasefire resolution that would lead to the release of the remaining hostages taken in the 7 October attack on Israel. The resolution, adopted on Monday, is the first time the security council has endorsed a comprehensive peace deal to end the Gaza war. Only Russia abstained in the vote. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on his eighth visit to the region since 7 October, said the statement of support from Sami Abu Zuhri for a UN resolution backing the proposal was a \u201chopeful sign\u201d, but that it was the word of the Palestinian militant group\u2019s leadership in Gaza that would really count. What does the deal entail? The three-stage deal, proposed by Joe Biden, involves the release of all the remaining hostages, in return for Israel accepting steps towards a permanent ceasefire and the eventual withdrawal of its forces from Gaza \u2013 two key Hamas demands. A third phase would involve a major reconstruction effort. What does Israel think of the deal? Far-right Israeli cabinet member Bezalel Smotrich \u2013 on whom Benjamin Netanyahu is now reliant after the resignations of more moderate ministers at the weekend \u2013 said he would oppose any deal, calling it \u201ccollective suicide\u201d. Trump will not be charged for waving around classified papers, judge says The federal judge overseeing Donald Trump\u2019s prosecution on charges of retaining classified documents ruled on Monday to expunge from the indictment a section describing a time when the former president allegedly waved around a classified document at his Bedminster club in New Jersey. In a move legal experts describe as unusual, US district judge Aileen Cannon said she would strike the paragraph because Trump was not charged with a crime for the conduct it described and it would be unfairly prejudicial if a jury later saw it at trial. The judge\u2019s ruling is notable in that it could indicate how she will rule on future motions as he attempts to limit the scope of the evidence prosecutors can introduce against him.

Stat of the day: May sets new global temperature record The average surface air temperature in May 2024 was 15.91C (60.63F), beating the previous record set in May 2020. It was the 12th consecutive month of record-breaking warmth for each respective month, highlighting an alarming trend in climate change. Sea surface temperatures also hit a new high in May, contributing to the overall global temperature increase.

Competition for control of the avocado \u2013 and the resources needed to produce it \u2013 has led to violence, often at the hands of cartels.

Belgian foundation Child Focus recorded 332 \u201cworrying\u201d disappearances of unaccompanied minors in Brussels last year, including a cohort aged 11 and 12. \u201cWith African minors, essentially Moroccan and Algerian, the most important area is the exploitation by OCGs [organised crime groups] involved in criminal activities such as drug trafficking,\u201d said Eric Garbar, head of human trafficking and smuggling at the Belgian federal judicial police. \u201cWhat we have in the EU is an unstoppable low-cost human resource from Africa.\u201d Climate check: World\u2019s top banks accused of \u2018greenwashing\u2019 A report is accusing five of the world\u2019s biggest banks of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d their role in the destruction of the Amazon, operating on environmental and social guidelines that fail to cover more than 70% of the rainforest. The report, produced by the watchdog Stand.earth and the Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA), alleges that these institutions have provided billions of dollars of finance to oil and gas companies involved in projects that are having an impact on the Amazon. \u201cThe banks try to wash their hands of the blame through vague policies, but must be held accountable for the damage their money is causing to Amazonian Indigenous peoples and the biodiversity of the rainforest,\u201d said Fany Kuiru, the general coordinator of COICA.

            "title": "UN security council endorses US-backed hostages-for-ceasefire Gaza deal",
            "date": "2024-06-10T21:05:56Z",
            "content": "The UN security council has adopted a resolution calling for Hamas to agree to a three-phase hostage-for-ceasefire proposal outlined by Joe Biden, the first time the body has endorsed a comprehensive peace deal to end the Gaza war. A Hamas statement said the group welcomed the resolution, though it was not immediately clear if that meant the leadership in Gaza accepted the ceasefire plan. After the vote, the US president, Joe Biden, wrote on X \u201cThe UN Security Council just adopted our resolution calling on Hamas to accept the deal to establish a ceasefire with the release of hostages. Hamas says it wants a ceasefire. This deal is an opportunity to prove they mean it.\u201d The position of the Israeli government is also ambiguous. It has officially accepted the peace plan but the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has sought to distance himself from it, and his coalition has shifted to the right since the proposal was put forward. Fourteen council members voted for Monday\u2019s resolution, none against, and only Russia abstained on the US-drafted resolution, which calls for an initial exchange of elderly, sick or women hostages for Palestinian detainees held by Israel in the course of an initial six-week ceasefire. The ceasefire would evolve into a permanent end to hostilities and the release of all hostages in a second phase that would be negotiated by the two parties and US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators. A third phase would involve the launch of a major reconstruction effort. The resolution calls on Hamas to accept the agreement and urges both parties \u201cto fully implement its terms without delay and without condition\u201d. The US has been seeking UN endorsement for the proposal since it was unveiled by Biden on 31 May. It won the support of the Palestinian mission, with a clause saying that an initial six-week ceasefire would be extended as long as talks continued over a second phase. The resolution said the US, Qatar and Egypt would \u201cwork to ensure negotiations keep going until all the agreements are reached and phase two is able to begin\u201d. A Palestinian presidential spokesperson, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, said the Palestinian Authority leadership would accept any resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza which preserved Palestinian territorial integrity. Palestinian support for the US resolution made it much harder diplomatically for Russia or China to veto it. Since the start of the Gaza war in October, the security council has struggled to find consensus against a backdrop of deep polarisation. It has agreed on humanitarian resolution involving temporary ceasefires but this is the first time it has embraced a comprehensive peace. \u201cOver the past eight months this council has often faced divisions and the world has taken notice with understandable frustration,\u201d the US envoy to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said after the vote. \u201cBut there\u2019s another side to this story because today we adopted a fourth resolution on this conflict.\u201d She declared: \u201cColleagues, today we voted for peace.\u201d The text stated that Israel had already accepted the ceasefire terms, though that claim is increasingly in question, as the country\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has made a string of sceptical comments on it, claiming that the US had only revealed parts of the plan, and insisting that any proposal for a lasting ceasefire without the complete destruction of Hamas\u2019s military and governing capacity is a \u201cnon-starter\u201d. The resignation over the weekend of a centrist minister, Benny Gantz, has left Netanyahu even more dependent on far-right members of his coalition, who adamantly oppose the deal. Hamas made positive comments when Biden first announced the deal, and said it welcomed the security council vote, but it has yet to give a formal response to the ceasefire proposal. The unusual show of relative unity by a deeply divided security council helps put pressure on both parties to strike an agreement, though both have shown themselves far more influenced by local constituencies and the personal interests of leaders, than by international public opinion. Prospects for a hostage and ceasefire deal were significantly complicated by an Israeli raid in Gaza on Saturday to rescue four hostages, which killed 274 Palestinians. One of the late changes made to the US draft resolution was designed to make it more palatable to Israel. It said the security council rejected any attempt to change the demographic or the geographical boundaries of Gaza, but it omits wording from the earlier version which specifically rejected the creation of a buffer zone around the coastal strip."

            "date": "2024-06-23T15:59:48Z",
            "content": "More than 200 Indian academics, activists and journalists have published an open letter urging the Indian government to withdraw last week\u2019s decision sanctioning the prosecution of the Booker prize-winning author Arundhati Roy under the country\u2019s stringent anti-terrorism law. \u201cWe \u2026 deplore this action and appeal to the government and the democratic forces in the country to ensure that no infringement of the fundamental right to freely and fearlessly express views on any subject takes place in our nation,\u201d the group said in the letter. One of the signatories, the history professor Ajay Dandekar, said the decision was unjustified. \u201cThe Indian constitution upholds Roy\u2019s right to the freedom of her opinions and we are a constitutional democracy,\u201d he said. Others also voiced support for Roy, including the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella group of farmer unions, which condemned the decision. A few protests by civil rights groups, activists, and students in Delhi and Bengaluru have also taken place. Last week the lieutenant governor of Delhi, Vinai Kumar Saxena, gave the go-ahead to the police to prosecute Roy, along with the academic Sheikh Showkat Hussain, under the anti-terrorism law, known as the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), for remarks they made at a seminar in 2010. Roy is reported to have said the disputed region of Kashmir had never been \u201can integral part of India\u201d. Ever since Roy\u2019s literary success in 1997, when she won the Booker prize for her debut novel The God of Small Things, she has been a sharp critic not only of Narendra Modi\u2019s government but of previous governments too. She has attracted praise and censure in equal measure for her critiques of capitalism, the treatment of minorities, and globalisation, as well as her support for human rights causes. However, the decision to prosecute her under the law, which makes bail difficult and results in people spending long years in prison awaiting trial, has shocked some Indians. \u201cAre we a democratic country or not?\u201d asked Mukta Manohar, the general secretary of the Pune municipality Safai union, one of the signatories. \u201cWe signed the letter because we have to uphold our constitutional right to disagree with the government. We can\u2019t let the government take revenge against critics like Roy out of some personal whim.\u201d Arnab Goswami, an unapologetically pro-Modi TV anchor, expressed his \u201cdelight\u201d at the lieutenant governor\u2019s decision. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that Arundhati Roy, that terrorist supporter, that Maoist sympathiser, what I call a Gucci separatist, who made speaking against India a career option when her books failed, is finally going to be prosecuted,\u201d said Goswami. What remains unclear is why the decision to prosecute has been taken at this particular moment, when the complaint against her, filed by someone who attended the seminar, has been pending with the police for 14 years without being pursued. Lawyers say they are puzzled as to why such a draconian law has been invoked. The supreme court lawyer Sanjay Hegde thinks that if Roy had been prosecuted under other, less harsh laws such as those dealing with provoking disharmony or inciting enmity among certain groups, the government would have run foul of the statute of limitations. No such limitation applies to the UAPA. Nonetheless, Hegde thinks the case will be challenged in the courts at a very early stage for two reasons. \u201cThe police will have to explain the 14-year delay and also explain why she should be charged when her words have not resulted in any violence or criminal acts in all this time,\u201d he said. The human rights lawyer Colin Gonsalves agreed that the case, if the government goes ahead, could collapse at the first hurdle. \u201cIt\u2019s a crazy decision and they won\u2019t be able to prove that Roy was linked to any violence or any efforts to overthrow the state. The prosecution is unlikely to succeed,\u201d he said. Nor is it clear whether the decision to sanction action against her is based on evidence that has emerged from a police investigation or whether it is expected to emerge from a police investigation that is still to take place. Some liberals had hoped Modi\u2019s reduced majority in the recent general election and his dependence on two regional parties could herald a more tolerant approach to dissent. But Hegde said the opposite seemed to be happening and that Roy had been chosen as a target for being a \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d in that she is seen as representing a broad swathe of intellectuals and activists ranged against the government. Even if the prosecution failed, he said, it would send a loud message to Modi\u2019s critics that keeping quiet was their best option because one day the state may come looking for them under the UAPA. \u201cThe message is, don\u2019t think that given our reduced mandate, we are going to be any nicer. If anything, we may be even harsher than before,\u201d said Hegde."

            "date": "2024-06-15T14:07:37Z",
            "content": "Indian authorities have granted permission for the prosecution of the Booker prize-winning Indian novelist Arundhati Roy over comments she made about Kashmir at an event in 2010. The top official in the Delhi administration, VK Saxena, gave the go-ahead for legal action against Roy, whose novel The God of Small Things won the Booker prize in 1997, under anti-terrorism legislation, alongside a former university professor, Sheikh Showkat Hussain. The action against Roy and Hussain, a former professor at the Central University of Kashmir, is over allegedly making provocative speeches, the Press Trust of India reports, citing officials from Saxena\u2019s office. Saxena, who is serving as the lieutenant governor, is a politician from prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ruling BJP. While Roy, 62, is one of India\u2019s most famous living authors, her activism and outspoken criticism of Modi\u2019s government, including over laws targeting minorities, have made her a polarising figure in India. Friday\u2019s development follows the news that Saxena had last October given approval for the case to proceed before the courts \u2013 more than a decade on from when a criminal complaint against Roy and several others was originally filed. The complaint concerned Roy\u2019s comment that the disputed territory of Kashmir was not an \u201cintegral\u201d part of India, and accused her and others of giving speeches advocating the secession of Kashmir from India. Roy\u2019s home in Delhi was besieged by protesters in 2010 when her comments from the panel discussion were published, when about 150 members of the BJP women\u2019s organisation demanded that she retract her statement or leave the country. The decision to prosecute was denounced by the Communist party of India (Marxist), which said in a statement: \u201cCondemnable. The Delhi LG has granted permission to prosecute Arundhati Roy under the draconian UAPA [Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act] for a speech reportedly made 14 years ago \u2013 in 2010. Defies logic except the fascist kind. Timing is suspect since courts are on vacation, as are lawyers.\u201d The UAPA \u2013 under which the prosecution has been granted \u2013 is unconstitutional and undemocratic, say critics. UAPA, ostensibly a terrorism prevention law, has been routinely used by the Modi government to try to silence government critics, including lawyers, activists, journalists, priests, poets, academics, civil society members, and Kashmiri civilians. In recent years, Roy has stood out as one of the most high-profile critics of Modi\u2019s government, which has been accused by rights groups and others of targeting activists and the suppression of free speech. Roy was contacted for comment through her agency."

            "date": "2024-06-05T20:36:20Z",
            "content": "French anti-terror prosecutors have launched an investigation after a Ukrainian-Russian man detonated explosive materials in a hotel room north of Paris. A source at the French anti-terrorism prosecutors office (PNAT) said that on Monday night the 26-year-old man was given medical treatment by fire officers in a hotel in the Val-d\u2019Oise, north of Paris, for \u201csignificant burns after an explosion\u201d. An initial search of his hotel room led to the discovery of \u201cproducts and materials intended for the manufacture of explosive devices\u201d, the source said. The man, of Ukrainian and Russian nationality, was still being questioned by police on Wednesday night. The source confirmed that the PNAT, working with France\u2019s domestic spy agency, had opened an investigation into the man, who was suspected of participating in a terrorist conspiracy and bomb plot. It is not clear at this stage if the man is suspected of acting alone or in a group. The suspected is reportedly from the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, part of which has been occupied by pro-Russian and Russian forces since 2014. Another source, who asked not to be named, told the AFP news agency that he appeared to have a \u201cpro-Russian attitude\u201d after fighting \u201cfor two years for the Russian army\u201d. The Ukrainian and Russian embassies in Paris did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, which is close to where the man was arrested, said operations had not been affected. France is on maximum threat alert with less than two months to go until the start of the Paris Olympics. The Games will take place against a complex geopolitical backdrop with the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and pose a major security challenge. Last month French security services said they had foiled a planned attack on the Games with the arrest of an 18-year-old Chechen man allegedly preparing a suicide attack at Saint-\u00c9tienne\u2019s football stadium. At the end of May, before Monday\u2019s arrest, the interior ministry said 50 attacks had been foiled by French intelligence services since 2017. This week France is also hosting high-profile commemorations of the 80th anniversary of D-day in Normandy. US president Joe Biden, Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine and other leaders are expected to attend the main event on Thursday. The presence of so many foreign leaders in France was one reason why the case was immediately handed to the anti-terror prosecutors, a source said. Paris has indicated that President Emmanuel Macron is also seeking to ramp up support for Ukraine, including military backing \u2013 moves that have angered Moscow.

            "date": "2024-06-20T06:00:28Z",
            "content": "We live in uncertain times. Economic shocks, technological changes, pandemics, the climate emergency and conflict after conflict have combined to create a widespread mood of insecurity. This might seem to be the natural realm of the political right: a politics oriented around the protection of the status quo and rooted in the appeal of hierarchy and tradition. In recent years we have seen how it can fuel the populist right in particular, with its politics of stratification, coercion and isolation. The European parliament elections and the prospect of a far-right prime minister in France are just the latest demonstration of the appeal of \u201cbuild the wall\u201d messaging in an age of insecurity. For progressives whose political project draws on optimism about the future, and faith in the power of common endeavour, it makes for a challenging political environment. We might assume it is necessarily barren ground for progressives. But should we? Progressive political traditions also have answers to insecurity, albeit ones different in emphasis from conservative ones. They tend to locate the sources of fragility less in the connections between individuals, classes and nations than in the failings of (or the failings in managing) those connections. They concentrate on the root causes of insecurity, rather than merely on its most immediate manifestations. Progressive answers to those root causes \u2013 greater cooperation across sectarian and national divides, more cohesive and thus resilient economies and societies, and greater capacity for collective responses \u2013 deserve a hearing. As German chancellor Olaf Scholz has put it \u2013 most recently in his statement to the Bundestag on 6 June, and echoing Willy Brandt, \u201cOhne Sicherheit ist alles nichts\u201d (Without security, there is nothing). Around the world, policymakers, politicians and thinkers are grappling with elements of that same sentiment, adding up to something larger: something we might call \u201cprogressive security\u201d. This can be seen as a double-sided effort, asserting that progressives can be trusted with national security and the security people seek in their everyday lives by challenging the status quo to address the root causes of economic and social insecurity. This aligns more naturally with the different traditions \u2013 liberal, social democratic and green \u2013 of progressive politics. In an age of intensifying conflict, progressive leaders have been at the forefront of the new politics of geopolitical security. The two states that contribute most to Ukraine\u2019s self-defence against Russia\u2019s brutal full-scale invasion, the US and Germany, are led by centre-left governments. In a number of countries, it falls to progressives to rebuild military and intelligence-gathering capacity dismantled by budget-cutting, isolationist, conservative governments over the years. Yet, as a new paper produced for the Progressive Governance Summit in Berlin this week argues, progressive security goes beyond security in the military sense. It is both protective and emancipatory, rather than a wall shutting out threats; it is also a hill on which capabilities can converge in the interests of reducing those threats in the long run. Fundamentally, progressive security imagines security fundamentally as a function of three things: cooperation, cohesion and capacity. First, cooperation. Naturally, national governments must focus on their national interests. But in an age where the causes of global insecurity range from destabilising financial flows and dirty money to threats of terrorism, viruses, disruptive technology and the climate crisis, which all operate on a global scale, national governments must also work together ambitiously to reconcile steely awareness of the threats with inclusive, democratic values. The British Labour party\u2019s shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, has captured this pillar of progressive security well with his call for a \u201cprogressive realism\u201d. Second, security demands cohesion. A politics of \u201cthem and us\u201d contributes to worsening polarisation and inequalities that contribute to security threats. Extensive research has shown, for instance, a close link between material inequality and increases in violence and crime. Cohesion also contributes to people\u2019s subjective sense of security, which is bound up with their sense of belonging and self-esteem. That in turn depends on social inclusivity. All of this is the natural realm of progressives. And last, our societies cannot deliver security if they starve themselves of the institutional and financial capacity to do so. The crises of recent years \u2013 the pandemic, climate shocks, Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine \u2013 have been an education in the value of capable and resilient states, supply chains and civil societies in ways that defy old, laissez-faire assumptions about the overweening value of small-state and short-term efficiency. So progressive security also involves building this resilience, by, for instance, revisiting policies like Germany\u2019s debt brake, or the EU\u2019s stability and growth pact, in order to attract more investment. Most importantly, progressive security is about hope. The hope of building a more equal, greener and resilient society even in these dark days of human civilisation; a hope that it falls to progressives to restore and renew. In the next few months the governments of major western democracies in Washington, London, Berlin, Warsaw, Kyiv and Madrid and beyond may be united in a shared commitment to the principles of cooperation, cohesion and capacity. But this period may be brief, so we had better act today, not wait for tomorrow. Florian Ranft is a member of the management board at Das Progressive Zentrum, a thinktank, which is hosting the Progressive Governance Summit in Berlin, 21-22 June. The summit\u2019s keynote event is Freedom, Peace and Progress in Europe, a conversation between the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the Albanian-British academic Lea Ypi, chaired by the Guardian\u2019s editor in chief Katharine Viner.

            "date": "2024-06-14T02:45:42Z",
            "content": "Prosecutors will argue a teenage boy accused of terrorism intended to murder a bishop in south-western Sydney when he allegedly stabbed him during a sermon earlier this year. The 16-year-old is accused of travelling 90 minutes from his home to attack Assyrian bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel, 53, during a live-streamed sermon at Christ the Good Shepherd Church in Wakeley on 15 April. During a brief hearing at Parramatta children\u2019s court on Friday, the barrister for the commonwealth director of public prosecutions (DPP) said the boy had been charged with two new offences in addition to committing a terrorist act. Court documents showed the boy was charged on 31 May with causing wounding or grievous bodily harm with intent to murder over the alleged stabbing of Emmanuel, and wounding a second man with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The teenager allegedly stabbed Father Issac Royel, 39, when he tried to intervene following the alleged attack on Emmanuel, according to police. The priest and the bishop recovered after undergoing surgery. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Emmanuel, who has a popular online presence and a large following, is a prominent Orthodox Christian leader who had previously criticised Islam and the prophet Muhammad in public sermons. The teenager, who was wounded in a scuffle during the alleged attack, was charged in hospital later that week with committing a terrorist act, a commonwealth offence which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. At Friday\u2019s court hearing, the barrister acting for the DPP asked for the matter to be delayed by six weeks to give prosecutors more time to prepare their brief of evidence. The lawyer told the court that investigators were analysing 52,000 images and 7,500 photos on the boy\u2019s phone and it was taking them \u201cquite some time\u201d to see what, out of the \u201cextensive amount of material\u201d, could be \u201cdesignated\u201d as terrorist material. He told the court that a separate forensic analysis of evidence taken from the church \u201cmight cause further delay\u201d but he would be able to give the court an update in six weeks\u2019 time. Children\u2019s court magistrate Tracy Sheedy and the lawyer representing the teenager charged with the alleged attacks agreed to adjourn the case until 26 July. The boy, whose lawyer did not apply for bail on his behalf, will remain in custody and will appear before the court via audio-visual link at his next hearing. His lawyer previously told the court the boy had a history of behaviour consistent with mental health issues."

            "date": "2024-06-02T07:00:25Z",
            "content": "When Ocado entered the FTSE 100 six years ago, it was seen as a flag-bearer for changing consumer tastes, as traditional retailer Marks &amp; Spencer narrowly avoided relegation from the top tier on the same day. This week, those roles look set to be reversed, with M&amp;S riding high and Ocado now expected to drop out of the index of the UK\u2019s top companies in the quarterly reshuffle, after its valuation plunged to about \u00a33bn from a high of \u00a322bn during the pandemic. What\u2019s more, its joint venture partner M&amp;S is part of the reason for the weakness in its share price. The pair are wrangling over a final payment for their UK-based grocery delivery tie-up, Ocado Retail, which was hoped to be worth more than \u00a3190m. M&amp;S says it should pay nothing because performance has been so poor. Ocado\u2019s feisty boss, Tim Steiner, has threatened legal action in response. The final call on Ocado\u2019s FTSE position will be made using market data on 4 June, but based on Friday\u2019s figures its share price would have to take a last-minute leap to avoid relegation. That seems unlikely amid uncertain sentiment that has led to a drop of about 50% so far this year, to 373p. Ocado is described by Dan Coatsworth at stockbroker AJ Bell as \u201cone of the most Marmite names on the UK stock market\u201d. When high streets were shut down as way to control Covid, Ocado enjoyed a boost from the shift to home deliveries \u2013 and convinced many that the change would be permanent. In the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, it emerged that people had quite missed visiting a shop for their groceries, with the UK\u2019s online orders shifting back to about 11% of the market, from a peak of 14% in 2021. Specialists in ultra-fast grocery delivery which enjoyed a private-equity-backed boom during lockdown, such as Getir and Gorillas, have rapidly folded in the UK, leaving the field largely to takeaway meal specialists such as Deliveroo and Just Eat \u2013 none of which appear to be making much profit. The trajectory of such groups does not fuel confidence in the future for Ocado\u2019s own fast-track service, Zoom, one of its hoped-for growth areas. Ocado made a pre-tax loss of \u00a3394m for the year to 3 December 2023; the previous year\u2019s loss had been \u00a3500m. In April, a fifth of shareholders lodged a protest vote against the group\u2019s plans for a \u00a314.8m pay package for Steiner. Meanwhile, Ocado\u2019s focus on robot-led warehouse technology has proved to be rather inflexible, such that the company was unable to fully capitalise on booming demand during the pandemic, or row back later without major financial pain. Big supermarkets such as Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose have shut down at least some of their home-delivery warehouses, focusing instead on more cost-effective and flexible deliveries from stores. On the plus side, this year Ocado\u2019s retail venture with M&amp;S has stepped up sales growth. However, M&amp;S boss Stuart Machin has recently pointed out that Ocado\u2019s much-trumpeted Smart Platform technology upgrades \u2013 such as new software and robot picking arms to make deliveries more efficient \u2013 had been \u201cmuch delayed\u201d, possibly further cooling hopes for the group\u2019s efforts to sell its technology around the world. During the pandemic, Ocado\u2019s share price also took off as investors saw it as the UK\u2019s answer to Silicon Valley technology firms rather than simply an online grocer. It has undoubtedly won some major customers for its gadgetry, including Kroger in the US, Groupe Casino in France, Lotte in South Korea and Aeon in Japan, but investors had hoped for more. Critics, such as Shore Capital\u2019s Clive Black, note the millions spent on research and development in return for quite modest sales, while delays to key projects, such as a delivery centre for Coles in Australia, have hit confidence. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cDeals are not being signed as fast as investors were hoping for its future growth engine, Solutions. It charges third-party retailers to use Ocado\u2019s robotic systems. There\u2019s still big potential here, but timeframes of growth look more questionable and that\u2019s knocked the valuation.\u201d Ocado\u2019s expected exit from the FTSE 100 has only fuelled speculation that Ocado will look to list in the US instead of the UK. Steiner may encounter fewer complaints about multimillion-pound pay deals across the Atlantic but whether that will help find new fans of the group\u2019s robots remains in doubt."

            "content": "Immunisation rates are lagging in Australia\u2019s most vulnerable populations \u2013 the very young and old \u2013 with experts blaming practical barriers as well as the misinformation and vaccine hesitancy that took off during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020 Australia achieved a record high rate of 95.09% five-year-olds fully immunised against infectious diseases, even surpassing the government\u2019s target of 95%, which provides \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Between the ages of two months and five years, Australian children are supposed to receive vaccines against viruses including hepatitis B, diphtheria, whooping cough, meningococcal, polio, mumps, measles and rubella. However, the latest government data shows Australian children have fallen below that target, with only 93.93% of five-year-olds who have had all vaccines recommended for their age, 91.24% of two-year-olds and 93.16% of one-year-olds. The government\u2019s data breaking down rates by primary health network also shows certain areas have consistently lower rates. New South Wales\u2019s north coast, Queensland\u2019s Gold Coast and country Western Australia\u2019s rates are all below 90% for one- and two-year-olds. Vaccination rates for five-year-olds in the Gold Coast and country WA were above 90%, but not among children of that age in NSW\u2019s north coast. For the coastal Richmond Valley area within the North Coast Primary Health Network, immunisation rates are below 80% in the youngest age groups. A new study of more than 3,000 Australian parents published in the Medical Journal of Australia found misinformation and vaccine hesitancy increased during the pandemic compared with the views of research participants in 2017. But it also noted that practical barriers, such as disruption to routine vaccination services, was also a factor in decreasing childhood vaccination rates. Vaccination rates are also lagging in older populations not up to date on Covid and flu boosters during a winter wave of Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The most recent federal government data released in May shows only 40% of those over 75 are up to date in receiving their booster shot in the past six months, while only 25% of those aged 65-74 and only 4% of adults under 65 have received a booster shot in the past six months. Only 74% of aged care residents have received a booster dose since the beginning of last year. The government\u2019s advisory group for immunisation updated its guidelines in May recommending a booster dose every 12 months for Australians aged between 18 and 74, who are also eligible for a booster every six months, while those over 75 are recommended to receive a booster every six months. Prof Adrian Esterman, the chair of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of South Australia, said Covid-19 has encouraged vaccine hesitancy. \u201cI think the general thrust of what we\u2019re seeing is that Covid has put a spanner in the works,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically made a lot of people scared of getting vaccinated \u2013 not only adults but of getting their kids vaccinated \u2013 because of all the hype about how dangerous vaccines are. \u201cThe actual number of severe adverse events is minuscule compared to the millions and millions of doses given out.\u201d Prof Robert Booy, an infectious diseases paediatrician, said the overall drop in vaccination rates among children was \u201cnot a lot but it\u2019s important\u201d. \u201cWe need to re-establish the strong trust we\u2019ve always had for a long time with the Australian public about the safety and effectiveness of vaccination in children and adults,\u201d he said. Prof Peter McIntyre, the head of women\u2019s and children\u2019s health at the University of Otago\u2019s school of medicine, and a former director of Australia\u2019s National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, said he believed vaccine hesitancy due to the pandemic was part of the picture but should not be overstated. \u201cThe number of people who are not vaccinated because they are actively avoiding vaccine is still a small percentage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably only about 3% \u2013 maybe it\u2019s kicked up a little bit post-Covid.\u201d McIntyre said the most common reason people were not vaccinated and had not immunised their children was due to service barriers. He said there needed to be greater opportunities for accessing vaccination outside of appointments with GPs, who could often be difficult to get an appointment with, such as accessing vaccines through pharmacists or offering home-visit services. McIntyre said Australia should consider requiring children to be vaccinated to attend school or childcare, as occurs in the US. There were recommendations for schoolchildren in Australia to be vaccinated but it was not enforced, he said. Prof Julie Leask, a vaccine expert at the University of Sydney, said lagging vaccination rates were the result of issues including access to services and vaccine acceptance. Leask said the disparity in rates between areas often demonstrated inequity in access to services where there is more poverty and social exclusion. \u201cThere\u2019s been a big focus on vaccine refusal and misinformation as if there\u2019s this direct and linear impact,\u201d Leask said. \u201cPeople can reject vaccination because of negative experiences with healthcare and due to certain beliefs and values.\u201d"

            "title": "Bird flu pandemic risk rises as cow cases appear and officials warn of humans\u2019 role",
            "date": "2024-06-19T11:00:31Z",
            "content": "Bird flu cases among animals continue to rise as US officials warn about the role of humans in spreading the virus. There are now 102 herds in the US with H5N1 cases, though given the prevalence of inactivated virus in commercially available pasteurized milk, experts believe the true number may be even higher. Poultry operations have reported cases likely linked to dairy farms, indicating the virus may be spilling back from cows into birds. Nearly 97m domesticated birds in the US have been affected by the highly pathogenic influenza since 2022. Although officials believe this outbreak was originally sparked by a single introduction from migratory birds into cows \u2013 for instance, via feed contaminated by bird feces \u2013 late last year, genomic analyses now suggest it is being spread between animals and farms by human activity, according a report released by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Thursday. The report, which focused on cases in Michigan, found that transmission is likely happening when workers, cows, vehicles and equipment go to multiple farms. Among employees at dairies with outbreaks, one in five employees work at other dairies and 7% work on poultry operations as well. That\u2019s in addition to the veterinarians, nutritionists and haulers who regularly visit multiple farms. Three in five Michigan dairies with outbreaks use shared vehicles to transport cows, but only 12% clean the vehicles first. All but one of the affected dairies belong to the same milk co-ops. The results are in line with a second report also released by the USDA on Thursday, showing that about one-third of employees at US dairies with outbreaks also work on other farms with livestock \u2013 usually dairy farms, but sometimes swine and poultry. More than half of affected dairy farms across the US share trucks and trailers to transport cows, and more than half of those who share vehicles don\u2019t clean them first, the report said. \u201cBiosecurity is the key to prevention,\u201d Kammy Johnson, a veterinary epidemiologist with the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, told reporters on Thursday. That means decontaminating everything that goes from farm to farm \u2013 transportation, clothing, equipment \u2013 and reducing the chances of infected animals, or people, passing the virus onward. It\u2019s not clear if the outbreak is continuing to gain force, officials said, but they expect to find more cases in cows. And, as the virus evolves, it could become more of a threat to people, according to a recent report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Officials expect to see more bird flu cases among humans as the outbreak continues, the report said. \u201cThe more infections there are among cows, the more risk there is for infections to occur among humans,\u201d Dr Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, told reporters on Thursday. \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s in 20% of our milk supply should be disturbing to everyone because that means it\u2019s gone around already,\u201d Xavier Becerra, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said last week. \u201cIf it starts to jump, that\u2019s when we really have to worry.\u201d Yet testing has lagged, in a situation reminiscent of the Covid-19 pandemic. The only authorized test for H5N1 among humans comes from the CDC, and it is only available to people who have symptoms and a history of close contact with infected animals or other people. So far, there have only been 45 tests performed this year. Yet there have been reports of workers with positive flu A tests that are not sequenced for H5N1, as well as potential missed cases, like the farm workers and a local maternity worker who reported flu-like symptoms near the first confirmed human case this year in Texas. Providers may now be reluctant to test for influenza even if a patient has respiratory symptoms, since the flu season has ended and thus insurance companies may not pay for the tests. The USDA requires lactating dairy cows to be tested before moving across state borders. The federal government does not have the authority to require testing of animals or people on a wide scale, which means these efforts largely fall to state and local entities. In Wisconsin, for instance, which has not yet announced any infections in cows, farmers are now required to test cows before taking them to fairs and exhibits. Cows have died in at least five states \u2013 South Dakota, Michigan, Colorado, Ohio and Texas \u2013 because they didn\u2019t recover or developed secondary infections after testing positive for H5N1. The majority of infected cows recover, but these deaths indicate the potential financial burden of an uncontrolled outbreak. Barn cats and mice have also tested positive for H5N1, raising concerns the animals could spread the virus in communities beyond the farms. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 June 2024. Barn cats and mice tested positive for H5N1, not H1N1 as an earlier version said."

            "title": "Prof Arturo Casadevall: \u2018It is hubris to think a fungal pandemic can\u2019t happen to us\u2019",
            "date": "2024-06-15T16:00:25Z",
            "content": "Arturo Casadevall is a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He has spent four decades investigating how fungi can both improve and devastate life as we know it. His new book, What If Fungi Win?, charts how we might overcome the rising threat. What first fascinated you about fungi? When I was in training as an infectious disease fellow [in the 1980s], Aids was the biggest problem we had. Patients were not dying of HIV infections [which attack the immune system, leaving it vulnerable to other diseases], they were dying of opportunistic infections \u2013 and these were often fungal. This was the first large-scale human fungal crisis in history. Once I began working on the medical side of fungi, I discovered the wonders of this kingdom. The award-winning series The Last of Us charts a world where a fungus triggers the apocalypse. Could that happen? Improbable, but not impossible. Right now, we don\u2019t know of any fungus that can turn a human into a zombie. But there\u2019s no question in my mind that we\u2019re likely to see dangerous new fungal pathogens emerge in time. In fact, we are already seeing it happen. So who knows? In your book, you describe the climate crisis as a major risk for fungi developing beyond our control. Why is that? Everything in our environment is being affected as temperatures rise; there\u2019s no reason to believe fungi will be an exception. As modern medicine paradoxically creates more people who are vulnerable to new fungal infections, there\u2019s increasing evidence that certain fungi have the potential to unleash new diseases that will harm many more humans in unprecedented ways. What would happen if fungi could adapt to higher temperatures? They would jump over our defences. Are we then going to see many more fungal diseases? That is the fear. Has this happened already? Candida auris was unknown to medicine until 2007 when it was recovered from the ear of an individual in Japan. And then a few years later, in 2010, 2011, 2012, it emerges independently on three continents [South America, Africa and the Indian subcontinent]. So we have a medical mystery. We have an organism that medicine didn\u2019t know anything about. One of the things that we have proposed is that this may have been the first fungus to breach our thermal barriers [most fungi cannot survive at 37C degrees, the body\u2019s internal temperature] after adapting to higher temperatures. It is likely the first example of a new fungal disease emerging from climate change. Can fungi be harnessed for good? Fungi are critical elements for life on Earth. They benefit us in foodstuffs \u2013 you can\u2019t have wine without fungi, you can\u2019t have fermentation without fungi. They are the source of groundbreaking medicines, such as penicillin and statins. Innovators are using fungi to make vegan leather car seats and construction materials. Others are using them to degrade the plastics that fill our landfills. Going forward, they may be sources of new materials, things that could make our everyday life better. Could they be used for more sinister ends? You always worry about engineering organisms for evil. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s being done by anybody. But certainly [for] a kingdom that is so large and so diverse and has so many powerful species, that has to be on the radar \u2013 that bad actors could use it in some way. They make powerful toxins, so they have been considered as agents for biological warfare. There are nefarious uses with fungi but, generally, the good and the potential good that they do far, far outweighs the negatives. How could they be used for biological warfare? Many of the fungi make spores, and the spores are designed to be carried in the wind. Generally when people make biological warfare, they have to change the organism so it can be dispersed by air. Well, the fungi come ready-made to be dispersed by air. Could they cause a pandemic? Humanity does not have experience with a fungal pandemic, but other species do. The amphibians are being decimated by a fungus that has spread to all the continents. So if a fungus can do that to amphibians that have been around for millions of years and which have good immune systems like we do, then I think it is hubris to think that something can\u2019t happen to us. We have a huge blind spot when it comes to the diseases and toxins fungi can wield. What are the biggest challenges in fighting back against fungi? Because fungi are our closest relatives, it\u2019s hard to find drugs that kill them and don\u2019t hurt us. Then there is the economic explanation. Many fungal diseases are not as common [as others], and if you\u2019re a pharmaceutical company and you\u2019re thinking about where to put your money, you often [make the decision] based on market size. Progress is being made, but we have a long way to go. In terms of your own research, what are you most excited about? It turns out that fungi, most of them, make melanin, the same melanin that we have in our skin. This melanin has a lot of properties that can be harnessed. For example, melanin is a natural shield for radiation. [It] is almost like science fiction, but we are working with Nasa collaborators on the idea that melanin from fungi can be used for shielding for spacecraft. I\u2019m also excited about some of the progress that we are making in understanding how fungi cause disease. If you understand the mechanisms, you may be able to interfere with them \u2013 and if you can interfere with them, you can help people. You\u2019ve spoken out about the rise of counterfeit research being driven by \u201cfraudulent data and sloppy science\u201d. How widespread is the problem? I\u2019ve been very worried for a long time that science is not working as well as it should. We have done studies showing that there was an epidemic of retractions. Why is that? Well, we found out that there was a significant amount of misconduct. That\u2019s totally intolerable. I look at this almost like an existential problem. If science doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s not going to give humanity the tools it needs. And if people lose confidence in us [scientists], they\u2019re going to cut the funding, and then it\u2019s all going to be a downward spiral. Less funding, less science, less solutions. The name of the book is What If Fungi Win?. What if they do win? I think they already won. And I think that if they win, we win.

            "date": "2024-06-18T14:07:27Z",
            "content": "World leaders are \u201cgambling with their children\u2019s and grandchildren\u2019s health and wellbeing\u201d by failing to prepare for a future pandemic, a new report warns. Amid surging cases of H5N1 bird flu in mammals, and an mpox outbreak in central Africa, two senior stateswomen have said the lack of preparation had left the world vulnerable to \u201cdevastation\u201d. Helen Clark, former prime minister of New Zealand, and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former president of Liberia, were co-chairs of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, which was set up by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2020. At a World Health Assembly in May 2021, the panel set out a series of recommendations to change how the world tackled pandemic threats and avoid mistakes made during the Covid-19 response. Today, they said that at the current rate of preparation, the world would probably be overwhelmed by any new pandemic threat. \u201cThis is not the time to gamble. Inaction is a dangerous political choice,\u201d they wrote in a new report, accusing leaders of shifting focus \u201cto more politically pressing issues\u201d. The three years since their first recommendations are \u201ca dangerously long time to leave gaping holes in the national, regional and international systems meant to protect 8 billion people\u201d, they said The H5N1 bird flu outbreak, which is affecting rising numbers of mammals including dairy cattle in the US, \u201cportends an influenza pandemic the world is nowhere near ready to manage\u201d, the report warned. Meanwhile, a new deadlier form of mpox has led to children dying in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where there is little access to testing and no access to vaccines. \u201cThe worst could be around the corner \u2013 these should be seen as canaries in the mine,\u201d said Clark. \u201cWe need to be prepared for something that could happen at any time and re-energise leaders around getting the right arrangements in place globally and nationally.\u201d The report warns of a lack of efficient systems that low and middle-income countries can rely on for access to drugs and vaccines in the event of a new pandemic. Surveillance systems lack rigour, and there is \u201ca dangerous gap in trust between countries, within countries, and within communities\u201d. International finance is insufficient, and countries struggling with debt and high interest rates are not investing enough domestically. There has been some progress, the report notes, such as agreement earlier this month to amend International Health Regulations to improve the speed at which information is shared, and to formalise the definition of a pandemic emergency. However, Clark said those changes would need to be fully implemented, and called for more transparency on countries\u2019 levels of preparation, an independent monitoring body, and a formal group of world leaders working on pandemic prevention. Changes to the structure of the WHO might be needed, she suggested. She said: \u201cThe funds now available pale in comparison to the needs, and high-income countries are holding on too tightly to traditional charity-based approaches to equity. \u201cThe pandemic agreement is vital and must succeed but has yet to be agreed. In short, if there were a pandemic threat today \u2013 such as if H5N1 began to spread from person to person \u2013 the world would probably again be overwhelmed.\u201d \u201cThere were lessons to be learned from Ebola in West Africa,\u201d said Johnson Sirleaf. \u201cJust five years later, having not applied those lessons, there were lessons to be learned again from Covid. There is no need to keep learning. Instead of gambling, leaders can make practical decisions and apply those lessons.\u201d"
