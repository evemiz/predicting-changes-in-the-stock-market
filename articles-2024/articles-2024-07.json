            "content": "Pressure on Beijing to take steps to improve Chinese consumer confidence has intensified after news that weak retail spending dragged down the growth rate of the world\u2019s second biggest economy. With falling house prices still acting as a drag on activity, official figures showed the Chinese economy expanding at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter \u2013 much weaker than the 5.1% expected by the financial markets. Annual retail sales growth slowed from 3.2% to 2% in the three months ending in June \u2013 the weakest in 18 months \u2013 and fell slightly in June alone. Lynn Song, the chief China economist at ING bank, said retail sales growth was the lowest since the country emerged from Covid-19 lockdowns and showed the depressed state of consumer confidence remained a big headwind to the economic recovery. \u201cA negative wealth effect from falling property and stock prices, as well as low wage growth amid various industries\u2019 cost cutting is dragging consumption and causing a pivot from big-ticket purchases toward a basic \u2018eat, drink and play\u2019 theme,\u201d Song said. The government in Beijing has set a growth target for 2024 of 5% \u2013 something analysts consider to be a stretch in the absence of tax cuts, spending increases and measures to help the property market. On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded by 0.7% in the three months to June, compared with a downwardly revised 1.5% in the first quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said. To counter soft domestic demand and its property crisis, China has increased infrastructure investment and ploughed funds into hi-tech manufacturing. Strong export growth has partly compensated for the reluctance of consumers to spend. Figures released last week showed China\u2019s exports in June were up 8.6% from a year earlier, while imports shrank by 2.3%. Duncan Wrigley, the chief China+ economist at Pantheon Macro, said: \u201cThe property market is showing tentative signs of bottoming out. New home prices sank 0.67% month on month in June, a trivial improvement from the 0.71% drop in May. Preowned home prices dropped 0.85%, after the 1.00% dive in May. Residential sales value fell 12.2% year on year in June, partly thanks to base effects, after crashing 26.4% in May.\u201d"

            "content": "The pace of US economic growth accelerated in the last quarter, remaining unexpectedly resilient in the face of high interest rates and persistent inflation. Gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of economic health \u2013 rose 2.8% in three months to June, the commerce department reported on Thursday, ahead of economists\u2019 expectations and up sharply from 1.4% in the first quarter. It comes as the presidential election campaign heightens scrutiny of the US economy. While Joe Biden touted the \u201cstrongest economy in the world\u201d as he announced his withdrawal from the race on Sunday, Donald Trump \u2013 who is running to replace him in the White House \u2013 has accused Biden of weakening the economy. In a statement, Biden said: \u201cWhen I took office, we were in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Today\u2019s GDP report makes clear we now have the strongest economy in the world.\u201d Biden said there was \u201cmore to do\u201d over the final six months of his term. \u201cThe vice-president and I will keep fighting for America\u2019s future \u2013 a future of promise and possibilities, of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things,\u201d he said. Despite relatively rosy economic figures, nearly three in five Americans wrongly believe the US is in recession, and the majority blame the Biden administration, according to a Harris poll conducted for the Guardian in May. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve scrambled to bring down inflation from its highest level in a generation, raising interest rates to a two-decade high. They are now considering when to start cutting rates, amid early signs that price growth is falling back towards the Fed\u2019s 2% target. \u201cThis is a perfect report for the Fed,\u201d Olu Sonola, head of economic research at Fitch Ratings, said of Thursday\u2019s GDP numbers. \u201cGrowth during the first half of the year is not too hot, inflation continues to cool and the elusive soft landing scenario looks within reach.\u201d Economists had expected GDP growth of about 2% in the second quarter. Some have questioned how the US economy will fare later this year as high rates take their toll. \u201cWe expect a slowdown from here,\u201d economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics told clients earlier this week, \u201cdriven by the mounting pressure from high interest rates, which likely are only now starting to exert their full impact on the real economy, given the long lags involved.\u201d Associated Press contributed reporting"

            "date": "2024-07-22T14:47:35Z",
            "content": "When Laura Kudrna bought her home on the Ladywood estate in Birmingham, it brought to an end a 12-year period of renting in which she\u2019d moved 20 times. \u201cI was so excited to be able to stay in a home that I thought I would have for life,\u201d she said. But her new sense of security was shattered when she found out that her property was one of 1,900 dwellings listed for potential demolition in what is thought to be one of Europe\u2019s biggest single-site estate regenerations. The scale of the proposed project is staggering: 6,000 people could have their homes torn down as part of a \u00a32.2bn project in which 1,266 council houses and 567 properties belonging to private homeowners could be repossessed in a mass compulsory purchase order for the area. In their place, 7,500 homes will be built in a high-density housing plan on a 61-hectare (150-acre) site. About 1,000 of these will be designated as affordable council-owned homes, according to a report presented to cabinet. If the numbers involved seem imposing, the strength of feeling in opposition to the plan is more than a match. Residents said they were furious and accused the council of \u201cpsychological economic violence\u201d. The battle lines have been drawn over familiar terrain. Birmingham Council described the initiative as the most significant redevelopment project in a generation, in a city where there is an urgent need to build more housing. The number of people who presented to the council as homeless rose to 600 a week last year. On the other side of the debate, Kudrna, 39, is a member of the Ladywood Unite campaign which is voicing people\u2019s concerns about the project. They say they understand the need to increase the housing stock, but not through the demolition of good homes. She said: \u201cThey appear to be planning to knock down good-quality and new housing for this. It is just so egregious. We are absolutely pro-home building. There\u2019s a lot of great land to build on in Ladywood, like this building is derelict, and this building is derelict,\u201d she said, pointing to vacant land near her home. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they just build on those instead of coming after our homes?\u201d The project will be done in phases over a 15- to 20-year period, and compulsory purchase orders would be used as a last resort, the council said. Homeowners would be entitled to a compensation package and the council was exploring options to help people living on the site buy the new homes, for example through shared equity. The council said it intended to take a \u201cbuild-first approach\u201d, meaning people would not be moved out of their homes until a new property became available on site, and would ensure no one had to leave Ladywood if they did not want to. Some people said they were sceptical this would happen. George Smith, who is retiring from his job as the head of an academy trust when he turns 60 this summer, had planned to spend his free time enjoying life at the home he bought when it was built 30 years ago. It sits on a modern, well-maintained estate, but it falls within the red line of the proposed demolition zone, and is at risk of being flattened. \u201cI own the freehold. I\u2019ve put everything in here, this was a lifelong home. I had no thoughts I would ever need to move and, if I did, it would be on my own terms,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the real injustice of it all, and at the same time the council are being totally incompetent at meeting with us.\u201d The regeneration scheme has been beset by problems for months. At a consultation meeting held by the council last year, nearly 100 residents were unable to get into a community centre packed to capacity, prompting an angry crowd to form outside. \u201cThere has been a horrible lack of community engagement,\u201d said Kudrna. \u201cWe\u2019ve really struggled to get the council to meet us, or give us any information. It\u2019s psychological economic violence, truly.\u201d Marco di Nunzio, an associate professor in urban anthropology at the University of Birmingham, is studying the Ladywood regeneration scheme. \u201cBirmingham is seeing a return to what used to happen in the 60s, taking down entire areas and rebuilding them,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin the UK, there are town-planning laws which allow, if there is a public interest, the local authority to seize assets. \u201cBut is the Ladywood regeneration project in its present form actually in the public interest, if it involves displacing a large number of people to make room for a commercial endeavour, with no firm and binding commitment to deliver social and affordable housing?\u201d Ladywood has a large black and minority ethnic population \u2013 58%, compared with 51% in Birmingham as a whole \u2013 and high levels of poverty and deprivation. It has the highest child poverty level of any constituency in the UK. Di Nunzio said there were real fears people could be priced out of the area and there was a significant psychological impact of the upheaval. \u201cThe opacity of the process, that open-endedness when you\u2019re losing your home is excruciating. There is a huge issue of anxiety, some parts of the community are quite vulnerable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe level of injustice that you might experience, it really affects people\u2019s sense of self.\u201d The Labour government has set out plans to build 1.5m homes in its first term, and cross-party concerns have been raised about the risk of overriding community issues in the process. Ladywood residents said they feared the big push for more homes could put freehold properties at risk of demolition as part of similar schemes to increase housing density. Jayne Francis, the council\u2019s cabinet member for housing and homelessness, said: \u201cWe know that much of the community in Ladywood feels frustrated and uncertain about what the scheme means for them, and we\u2019d like to apologise for any distress caused.\u201d She added that the only decision that had been made was to appoint St Joseph, a subsidiary of the housing company Berkeley Group, as the council\u2019s preferred development partner. \u201cNo other decisions have been made on the regeneration scheme or what homes will or will not be demolished. The regeneration of Ladywood is right at the beginning of the process, with many decisions yet to be made with the community.\u201d Francis said the council was developing a \u201ccommunity and resident charter\u201d to set out its commitment throughout the project, and a second round of engagement workshops had begun. \u201cWe will work hard to rebuild trust with the Ladywood community and to make the most of this exciting opportunity to revitalise an area that was primarily built in the 1960s,\u201d Francis said."

            "date": "2024-07-13T12:00:19Z",
            "content": "For a chancellor targeting a decade in power, Rachel Reeves is in a hurry. After 14 years in the wilderness for Labour, and several centuries of Britain awaiting its first female chancellor, it\u2019s not surprising she is keen to get on with the job. So far, two ideas have predominated: blaming the Conservatives for the worst economic inheritance since the second world war, and laying the foundations for national renewal at breakneck speed. Reeves says there isn\u2019t any time to waste to get Britain on track for the highest sustained levels of growth in the G7. But it is a task that will involve tough trade-offs and challenges, and will come to define Keir Starmer\u2019s government. In the scramble to look busy, ministers have been hurriedly working behind the scenes to reshape the institutions of Whitehall and get the government machine aimed at Reeves\u2019s primary objective. One quick win was the creation of a new council of economic advisers, housed within the Treasury and led by top London School of Economics academics John Van Reenen and Anna Valero. More changes are due in Wednesday\u2019s king\u2019s speech, including the government\u2019s legislative plans for workers\u2019 rights, planning reform, the NHS and Great British Energy, Ed Miliband\u2019s prized low-carbon power company. Sources say we can expect a big announcement on infrastructure, too. The government is keen to show it is committed to getting mega-projects built after the stop-start failures of the Tory years. There is a rush to finalise plans, including the potential abolition of the National Infrastructure Commission, which would be replaced with a new body. Elsewhere, Starmer is setting up \u201cdelivery boards\u201d packed with external experts for his five key \u201cmissions\u201d for government: growth, energy, crime, education and health. The challenge, though, is whether the reforms will succeed in getting Britain\u2019s economy back on track. Successive governments have carried out similar tyre changes on the Whitehall motor, only to end up with the wheels spinning on the road to prosperity. This time Labour is preparing to rely heavily on the private sector, in acknowledgment of tight constraints on the public finances. After the Tories\u2019 Brexit-era \u201cfuck business\u201d approach, there is obvious latent potential to unlock. However, the government ought to be realistic about how far this might go. For decades, the UK has trailed comparable rich nations on business investment \u2013 a fact made worse by the economic vandalism of austerity, Brexit, and the churn of Conservative prime ministers. Figures from Capital Economics show total investment in the UK has shrunk from 26% of GDP in the late 1980s to 18% today \u2013 a bigger decline than the rest of the G7. That suggests Labour is aiming to get from the bottom of the investment league table to the top: the equivalent of Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016, a 5,000-1 dream come true. Bringing about stability will help. The UK now stands as a beacon of relative calm in an increasingly volatile world. There will be further tailwinds as inflation cools, and the Bank of England is likely to cut interest rates soon. Reeves\u2019s new national wealth fund could help encourage investment in some certain parts of the economy, as part of a broader modern industrial strategy \u2013 details of which are said to be in the pipeline. However, Labour\u2019s manifesto implies cuts to public investment as a share of GDP from the current starting point, putting even more weight on the private sector to lead the charge in Britain\u2019s unlikely Leicester-inspired campaign. Unlocking more private capital could require the government to be bolder with its own investment plans. To do so without deviating from Labour\u2019s tax promises, Reeves could use the review of public spending she commissioned last week to pave the way for changes in the government\u2019s fiscal rules. The chancellor is also said to be keen to revamp the Office for Budget Responsibility, including a request for reports on the long-term impact of capital spending decisions. Currently, the Treasury watchdog publishes five-year forecasts. But this fails to capture the benefits from big infrastructure programmes, which can take longer to materialise. Such a change could help strengthen the case for investment. There is ample evidence that this might be a good idea, including from Van Reenen and Valero, who were among the authors of a report earlier this year calling for a temporary boost to public borrowing to drive investment in sustainable technologies and infrastructure. \u201c[It] would prove cost-effective and beneficial to living standards and economic competitiveness by increasing productivity and economic growth,\u201d they wrote. In the early days of Labour\u2019s putative decade in power, this could have the biggest effect on growth."

            "title": "The Tulsa race massacre affected the \u2018economic freedom\u2019 of generations",
            "date": "2024-07-10T14:00:02Z",
            "content": "The story of the last known Tulsa race massacre survivors has always been a race against time. A race to preserve and uplift the history of the brutal moment, a race to give the last living survivors the time and platform to tell their story, and most important of all, a race to allow survivors to see a semblance of compensation for the trauma they experienced. The reality of the Oklahoma supreme court\u2019s decision last month to uphold a Tulsa county district court judge\u2019s decision to dismiss their lawsuit is that survivors have likely had their last chances for reparations denied. The reparations conversation around the Tulsa massacre has always been convoluted by an indignant air by the courts and state legislators of \u201cwhy should we have to pay for this\u201d and even more of an: \u201cIsn\u2019t acknowledging it happened enough?\u201d When we consider the estimated 300 Black people who died from the violence and the challenges faced by families in the years after to fight for justice or compensation, acknowledgment \u2013 particularly with just two survivors left \u2013 feels like pennies in comparison. It\u2019s difficult for any descendants to be made whole when parts of their family tree were wiped out so swiftly. But the Tulsa race massacre is a reminder that while there isn\u2019t a magic number that can quantify Black pain, there are real economic reverberations that Black trauma can have across generations. More broadly, today\u2019s generation of Black Americans are experiencing financial pressures. A Pew Research Center report released in February on how Black people view financial success found that 64% of Black adults consider their personal financial situation as only fair or in poor shape. In addition, the report found that about 65% of Black adults surveyed would not be able to sell their assets to cover three months of expenses if they lost their income, while 62% said they would not be able to borrow from family or friends. Financial success for Black people, according to the survey, showed that 67% said being debt-free is essential to how they view financial success. Meanwhile, 49% said that owning a home was an essential part of financial success and 44% said being able to pass down financial assets was essential for them. The fiery loss of businesses and homes at the hands of a white racist mob in 1921 in the Greenwood district, once considered to be the \u201cBlack Wall Street\u201d of America, was not only about loss of life but also loss of Black wealth. Community members today are working to revitalize and reimagine the Greenwood district while honoring its historical significance, but Lessie Benningfield Randle and Viola Fletcher, the last two known remaining survivors of the Tulsa race massacre, have waited decades for compensation. Hughes Van Ellis, another survivor who was part of the lawsuit, died last year at 102. They have lived long lives and gone on to have families. They moved forward with their lives because they had no choice, but they had to live with the memories of those violent nights and what happened to the community they had loved as young girls. Generations of Black Oklahomans lost out on homes and businesses that could\u2019ve been potentially passed on and uplifted those coming behind to a new economic status of prosperity and opportunity. In April, Tulsa city officials released the Tulsa Equality Indicators report, an annual look at inequality in economic opportunity, education, housing, justice, public health and services among Tulsa residents. The 2023 report showed that the median household income of white households was $62,411 compared with $39,779 made by Black households in Tulsa. In addition, 72.4% of south Tulsa residents had household earnings at or above the 200% poverty line while only 42% of north Tulsa residents met that indicator too. When it comes to homeownership, nearly 58% of white people owned their homes in the area while nearly 34% of Black people owned their homes. The intersections of racial trauma and financial trauma in the case of the Tulsa race massacre are not new, but denying survivors accountability or compensation intensifies the pain of this historical incident. Part of healing financial trauma includes understanding where our psychology and emotions around money and wealth comes from, including how we feel when we have money, how we feel when we spend money and more importantly, how we feel when we do not have money or feel like we do not have enough of it. Even the way we think about bills, savings and making large purchases has a psychological component to it. But there\u2019s also the more painful side of financial trauma whether it\u2019s remembering when the lights went out when the electricity bill didn\u2019t get paid, not being able to afford groceries or seeing an eviction notice on the door for unpaid rent or homes being foreclosed. In the case of the Tulsa massacre, it was generations of potential economic opportunity burned to the ground. It was dreams deferred. It was hope vanquished. It was a means of freedom robbed from under generations of Black people. Society today often assumes a multimillion-dollar price point is supposed to be attached to affirming the impact of traumatic incidents. Attempts at reparations and other compensation for Black survivors over the years has taken various shapes. In 1974, survivors of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, where hundreds of Black men had penicillin withheld from them, were part of a class-action lawsuit that led to a $10m settlement and health and medical benefits for them and their families. In 2022, Los Angeles county officials returned Bruce\u2019s Beach to descendants of Willa and Charles Bruce more than 100 years after the Manhattan Beach city council took it through eminent domain. Last summer, the family of Henrietta Lacks settled a federal lawsuit against Thermo Fisher Scientific decades after they took Lacks\u2019s cells without her consent while she was a cancer patient and went on to create HeLa cells that are the backbone of biomedical innovations. The attempt at reparation for Randle, Fletcher and their families\u2019 is about reckoning with the grief that comes with lost economic potential. As the last two known survivors \u2013 both 109 years old \u2013 settle into what will likely be the last years of their life, this is not only about acknowledgment of their pain, but about their hope to leave real dollars for the generations behind them to perhaps rebuild a legacy of business acumen and homeownership that was lost. But wealth, regardless of the actual dollar amount or the physical tangibles acquired from it, is also about economic freedom. Generations of Black people have often had their lack of wealth weaponized against their freedom, independence and their ability to fight back against systemic, structural and institutional racism. The court\u2019s decision to deny the Tulsa massacre survivors a path forward to be compensated for what they experienced compounds their own trauma and why the stakes are often high for Black people when they choose to go to use the court systems. The communal and financial means for Black people to fight injustice in court is no small feat, and in the aftermath of the violence many Black Tulsans tried to get economic relief from insurance companies and other legal avenues to no avail. Black people have often had to rethink what their idea of the American dream looks like and what the most viable path to generational wealth should be. Even as social and cultural movements have tried to disentangle work and US capitalism, the truth is that economic freedom is still an important aspect of this. Having the financial means to stand up to injustice or say no to the status quo of systemic and institutional racism and oppression is an undeniable part of wealth. As we look ahead to what\u2019s next for Randall and Fletcher, all we can hope is that their descendants will have the opportunity in their next lifetimes to be made whole or at the very least experience a partial payment of justice still owed."

            "date": "2024-07-11T07:10:36Z",
            "content": "The City watchdog will trigger the biggest shake-up of London stock market rules in more than 30 years this month, in an attempt to make the UK a more attractive place to list shares. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) confirmed on Thursday it would streamline and loosen rules for listed companies on 29 July, after months of hand-wringing over an exodus of companies from the London Stock Exchange for rival financial hubs. The revamped rules will scrap the UK\u2019s two-tier system of standard and premium listings. The premium listing heaped extra requirements on companies in exchange for a more prestigious label and entry into FTSE-branded indices. Ditching the premium label means companies will no longer have to hold shareholder votes before approving large mergers or takeovers. While current rules have been criticised by some for delaying or increasing the cost of standard deals meant to help companies grow, the change has raised concerns about eroding shareholder democracy. Companies will soon operate under one set of rules, simplifying what some industry bodies have claimed was a \u201ccomplex\u201d and costly listing regime. \u201cOur aim is to encourage a wider range of companies to choose to list, raise capital and grow in the UK, while maintaining high standards of market integrity and consumer protection,\u201d said the FCA\u2019s chief executive, Nikhil Rathi. The changes are a result of recommendations put forward in 2021 by Jonathan Hill, a former EU commissioner for finance. The FCA has already slashed the proportion of shares that must be offered to outside investors from 25% to 10%, and allows companies to issue dual-class shares that give founders more control of listed firms, in response to Lord Hill\u2019s report. Both sets of rules came into force in December 2021. It is also hoped that the latest changes reduce the number of companies leaving or snubbing London for overseas rivals, including the US. \u201cThe need for change is clear and widely acknowledged,\u201d Rathi said. \u201cThe risk otherwise is that our regime falls increasingly out of step with those of other jurisdictions, making it less likely that companies eager to grow choose the UK as a place to list their shares.\u201d The investment platform AJ Bell said the overhaul came with \u201csome serious potential negatives\u201d. \u201cThe government is clearly desperate to bolster UK listings as part of efforts to revitalise the City of London,\u201d said Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell. \u201cThe FCA\u2019s reforms risk diluting the quality of the UK stock market to a house made out of balsa wood. This includes giving shareholders less of a voice on matters like acquisitions, even though they are a company\u2019s owners.\u201d In May, the owner of Paddy Power, Flutter, announced it would switch its primary listing to New York, while the UK chip designer Arm opted to list on Wall Street last August after the government failed to convince it to float in London. The British fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown said in June it would accept a proposed offer from private equity investors, which would leave another hole in the FTSE 100 index."

Unbelievably, less than 2% of the \u00a32.5tn of pension fund assets run by over 30,000 \u2013 often very small \u2013 pension funds are invested in British companies, either on the public markets or as unquoted start-ups and scale-ups. It is a disgrace, serving neither the economy nor pensioners: root and branch reform, as I argue in my new book, This Time No Mistakes, is a precondition for higher growth. The review makes good the limited ambition of last week\u2019s pension bill. First and foremost, Britain needs fewer and much larger funds than the smorgasbord of tiny, underperforming funds whose trustees guard their independence so jealously that property market nimbyism looks tame. It is only very large funds, ideally over \u00a3100bn, that can diversify risk sufficiently to be able to invest more in the full range of productive assets, including those in the UK, to raise returns, boost the economy and lift pensions. Two important targets are identified. First, to explore ways to pool risk and consolidate the multiplicity of fast-growing but often minuscule defined contribution schemes and second, how to turbocharge the glacial consolidation of local government pension funds. That could bring \u00a31tn into productive investment. As important is the further \u00a31.4tn sterilised in closed defined benefit pension schemes. They need a guarantee (or \u201cunderpin\u201d) to persuade trustees to release \u00a3225bn of stagnating surpluses and for another 2,000 very small, closed defined-benefit schemes to agree to be merged into the highly successful Pension Protection Fund. Do all this, and Britain will at last have the investment pools to turn round its decaying stock market \u2013 and trigger an investment boom. \u2022 Will Hutton writes for the Observer and is co-chair of the Purposeful Company"

And remember, Thames has already been abandoned, in effect, by owners who think the firm is \u201cuninvestable\u201d. So, yes, heightened regulatory scrutiny looks like a minimum requirement until a workable solution is found. But the intriguing part was Ofwat\u2019s thinking on how Thames might eventually emerge from special measures. The company will need to show it can maintain \u201cadequate levels of financial resilience\u201d. This could involve \u201cintroducing a limit on the amount of debt the company can take on, a separation of the business into two or more water companies, or looking to a public listing to secure additional equity\u201d. The last of those \u2013 a return to the stock market \u2013 is the one to focus on. If Ofwat has finally concluded that a privatised water system in England and Wales works better if the companies are listed on the London stock market, give thanks. This column has been banging on (repeatedly) about the virtues of a listing. Why? First, stock market investors would never have tolerated the extreme over-leverage that was imposed on Thames after Macquarie bought the company in 2006. You cannot get away with 80%-plus gearing in the public arena. The three firms that still remain on the market \u2013 Severn Trent, United Utilities (in the north-west) and Pennon (owner of South West Water) \u2013 have never strayed far from regulatory norms of 60%-ish. Second, financial transparency improves on the stock market. You don\u2019t have holding companies in the Cayman Islands, or tax-minimising financing vehicles inserted above the regulated entity. Third, a share price and a six-monthly public reporting cycle provides a warning signal of trouble ahead. Incompetent and failing managements tend to be cleared out earlier. Fourth, a public listing ensures closer proximity to the public: the customers can buy shares if they wish. In the post-Macquarie era, Thames\u2019s ownership consortium has included giant sovereign funds from Abu Dhabi and China, for whom a UK water company is a faraway entry on a spreadsheet. A path back to the stock market for Thames looks far from simple, it should be said. Step one would surely have to involve a debt-for-equity swap to clear the decks and reduce the towering \u00a315.2bn pile of borrowings. The process could happen either voluntarily or be enforced via special administration \u2013 one or the other has probably become more likely after Thursday. Nobody should mourn for Thames\u2019s bondholders, who would take a whack in a financial reconstruction: they have also contributed to the soggy disaster. By way of further demonstration of the relative merits of stock market ownership, look at how the quoted firms emerged from Ofwat\u2019s five-yearly review. The business plans of Severn Trent and Pennon were the only two in the sector to be judged \u201coutstanding\u201d and United Utilities got a middle-of-the-pack \u201cstandard\u201d. Nobody is pretending the trio is faultless. All have had pollution and leakage woes (United notably at Windermere; Pennon with a diarrhoea and vomiting outbreak in Devon) And some of the executive bonuses are inexplicable (think Liv Garfield at Severn). Stock market ownership is not a cure-all. The point, though, is that the evidence of a couple of decades suggest it is easier to get listed companies to respond to regulatory incentives than unlisted ones. In a privatised system designed to reward relative outperformers, and penalise underperformers, that is an important point. Indeed, there is a fair argument that regulators only truly lost control of the whole privatised show after the take-private leveraged buyout boom of 2004-08. The new Labour government should take note. It is dead set against nationalising water companies \u2013 and rightly so. But it would perform a service if it could force more firms back to the stock market."

            "date": "2024-07-25T12:36:54Z",
            "content": "Stock markets in Europe and Asia took a tumble on Thursday as jitters over the future artificial intelligence-driven growth of major tech companies sparked a global sell-off. The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed the day down 0.7%, having been hit by a near 4% decline in the Dutch chipmaker ASML, a 7% drop in Germany\u2019s Infineon Technologies, and a 13.7% fall in Switzerland\u2019s semiconductor company STMicroelectronics. The rout began in the US overnight, where the tech-focused Nasdaq fell 3.6% on Wednesday, marking its biggest single-day decline since 2022. About $1tn (\u00a3776bn) was knocked off the value of the Nasdaq 100, which covers the most valuable firms on the index. The main losers were AI-related companies, including Nvidia, Tesla and the Google-owner Alphabet, whose shares have soared in recent months. Investors have poured money into the sector, to ensure they did not miss out on a potential tech boom in artificial intelligence. The fall has raised concerns about whether excitement over major tech stocks, known as the magnificent seven, has been overblown. Nvidia fell 7%, Alphabet fell 5%, Microsoft dropped 3.5% and Apple lost 3%. Other magnificent seven stocks also fell, including Facebook owner Meta, which dropped 5.6%. Tesla had its worst decline since 2020, dropping 12%. The company\u2019s boss, Elon Musk, had reported a 45% fall in profits and pushed back plans to unveil self-driving robotaxis from August to October, igniting scepticism among investors. Musk has been trying to drum up interest in plans for the robot taxis, artificial intelligence and \u201cgenuinely useful\u201d humanoid robots, as demand for Tesla\u2019s electric cars has cooled. The stock market losses later spread to Asia, where tech-related firms continued their decline. That included Samsung, which fell 2%, Sony, which fell 5%, and tech investor SoftBank, which fell 9.4%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei finished the session down 3%. However, the AJ Bell investment analyst Dan Coatsworth said the sell-off may be a \u201cnecessary correction\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is worth putting last night\u2019s weakness into perspective, given indices were recently trading at record highs and there were big moves in some enormous companies. \u201cWhether this is a necessary correction to remove some froth from the market or something more dramatic will depend on forthcoming earnings from the likes of Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Amazon next week, as well as AI-star Nvidia at the end of August.\u201d Early trading on Wall Street was more subdued on Thursday, with the Nasdaq, Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 indices slightly up, as GDP data showing that the US economy grew faster than expected in the three months to the end of June."

            "content": "The cybersecurity firm Wiz has turned down a $23bn (\u00a318bn) takeover bid from Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, spurning what would have been the tech company\u2019s biggest ever acquisition and seeking a stock market flotation instead. Alphabet had been in talks with Wiz, founded by alumni of Israel\u2019s cyberintelligence unit, as it seeks to catch rivals Microsoft and Amazon in the hyper-competitive cloud services market. Wiz offers a service that scans the data on cloud storage providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure for security risks. The New York-based startup, which has the backing of investors including Sequoia Capital and Thrive Capital, was most recently valued at $12bn. \u201cWhile we are flattered by offers we have received, we have chosen to continue on our path to building Wiz,\u201d the company told employees in an internal email. In a memo the Wiz chief executive, Assaf Rappaport, outlined the next targets of reaching $1bn in annual recurring revenue and an initial public offering. \u201cSaying no to such humbling offers is tough, but with our exceptional team, I feel confident in making that choice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market validation we have experienced following this news only reinforces our goal \u2013 creating a platform that both security and development teams love.\u201d Neither Wiz nor Google had released official statements about the termination of the deal talks by Tuesday morning. There has been scepticism that the deal would pass regulatory scrutiny, as regulators seek to toughen their stance against big tech dealmaking. In December, Adobe abandoned its $20bn takeover of its smaller rival Figma, after European and UK regulators raised concerns that it would eliminate competition in the product design software market. Last month, the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission struck a deal on investigations into the main protagonists in the AI market, including Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia. Wiz, founded in 2020, was valued at $12bn during a funding round in May that drew investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Thrive. Wiz says 40% of Fortune 100 companies are its customers, and that it is making $350m in annual recurring revenue."

            "content": "Falling inflation, football fans and fake tan drove supermarket shopping in recent weeks, when improving consumer confidence and excitement around the men\u2019s Euros tournament were only slightly dampened by wet weather. Sales at supermarkets increased by 2.2% year on year over the four weeks to 7 July, with football fans driving up purchases of beers, crisps and snacks on match days. Grocery price inflation has fallen to 1.6% this month from June\u2019s 2.1%, marking the lowest level since September 2021, according to retail analysts Kantar. That drop coincided with the fastest rise in monthly footfall so far this year, with Britons making 2% more trips to the supermarket than a year earlier. Excitement built as England made it to the Euros final, but were beaten by Spain 2-1 on Sunday night, dashing hopes of an end to 58 years without a major trophy. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: \u201cEngland\u2019s hopes might have been dashed on Sunday, but there was still some cause for celebration in the grocery industry. \u201cFootball fans drove beer sales up by an average of 13% on the days that the England men\u2019s team played, compared with the same day during the previous week.\u201d With most England matches played on \u201cschool nights\u201d, many people opted for no or low-alcohol beer, with sales up by 38% on match days. The soggy summer weather boosted sales of artificial tan by 16%, while cold and flu medicine sales jumped by 35%, and dampened demand for sun cream, with sales down 10% compared with last year, when the UK enjoyed the warmest June on record. During the cost of living crisis consumers have switched to supermarkets\u2019 cheaper own-label items but this trend has now reversed, with sales of branded products rising by 3.6%, outpacing own-label groceries at 2.7%. Before the king\u2019s speech on Wednesday, which will set out the newly elected government\u2019s legislative agenda for grocers and other sectors, McKevitt said: \u201cThe retail landscape looks very different from 2010 when the last Labour government was in power \u2013 and so do our shopping trolleys. \u201cAs diets have evolved, sales of popcorn, peanut butter and chilled vegetarian products, such as sausages and grills, have more than trebled. We\u2019re also more likely to have premium ground and bean coffee in our cups now.\u201d Ocado was the fastest-growing grocer for the fifth month in a row, with sales up by 10.7% over the 12 weeks to 7 July giving it a 1.8% market share. The discounter Lidl posted a 7.8% jump in sales, bringing its share of the market to 8.1%, while fellow budget retailer Aldi\u2019s market share is 10%. Waitrose gained market share for the first time since January 2022, edging 0.1 percentage point higher to 4.5%, as spending at the upmarket grocer increased by 3.3%. Britain\u2019s largest supermarket chain, Tesco, achieved its biggest gain in share since November 2021, taking 27.7% of the market, a 0.7 percentage point increase compared with last year."

            "content": "The fortunes of Australia\u2019s economy \u2013 and political polling of the Albanese government \u2013 may well hinge on the strength of Wednesday\u2019s inflation numbers. Economists expect headline consumer prices in the June quarter will land at an annual rate of 3.8%, accelerating from 3.6% in the prior three months. Core inflation \u2013 known as the trimmed mean \u2013 will be steady at 4%, a Bloomberg survey found. The Reserve Bank\u2019s own forecasts in May of 3.8% for both headline and core inflation for the quarter just ended were both elevated from its predictions early this year. An upside surprise will likely heap pressure on the central bank to lift its cash rate to 4.6% \u2013 a 14th hike in this cycle \u2013 when its board meets next Monday and Tuesday. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Australian Bureau of Statistics will release the inflation data at 11.30 AEST. Should it meet expectations \u2013 or even fall shy \u2013 the calls instead will be for early interest rate cuts to ensure an economy already close to stalling doesn\u2019t sink into recession. The RBA wants to be reassured inflation remains headed towards its preferred 2-3% range, a goal it currently expects will be achieved by the end of 2025. Households and businesses with debt are hoping it won\u2019t take another RBA rate rise to ensure that trajectory is retained. Since the central bank began hoisting rates in May 2022, monthly mortgage repayments have increased about $240 per $100,000 borrowed, according to RateCity. Another quarter-point hike would add about $15 to the load and erode some of the government\u2019s modified stage-three tax cuts delivering families about $240 a month. The investment bank UBS is in the minority, predicting the RBA will hike its cash rate to 4.6% next week. CPI has remained above the bank\u2019s target band for 12 consecutive quarters and the past three months will make it 13, it noted. Governor Michele Bullock said in May the RBA board \u201chas been clear that it has a low tolerance for allowing inflation to return to target more slowly than currently expected\u201d, the bank noted. To do so \u201cwould risk eroding public credibility in our commitment to low and stable inflation\u201d. Even accounting for some stickiness in inflation, Australia would be almost alone among rich nations in considering another rate rise. Only Japan, which in March lifted its key interest rate for the first time in 17 years as that nation\u2019s deflation threat finally ebbed, is still considering raising borrowing costs. Canada and the European Union have started cutting rates and the US may follow in September. That downward shift may give the RBA\u2019s nine-member board additional cause to stay put \u2013 as it has done since last November. Politicians have sought to frame the outcome knowing the possible boost \u2013 or hit \u2013 to the government\u2019s standing may pivot on the ABS readings. An election this side of Christmas would be in prospect if the government viewed the RBA\u2019s job was done. Another rate rise, though, would likely delay any election until next May, when the term ends, as any rate relief hopes dim. \u201cAustralians are in enormous pain because of Labor\u2019s homegrown inflation crisis,\u201d shadow treasurer Angus Taylor said, adding the country was the only one among the top 10 economies to have higher inflation compared with the end of 2023. \u201cAustralians face higher prices, higher interest rates and higher taxes for longer because of Labor\u2019s bad economic management,\u201d Taylor said. Treasurer Jim Chalmers said inflation was \u201cpersistent\u201d in the June quarter but the government remained confident it would resume its moderation from now. \u201cWe expect the big drivers on Wednesday to be things like insurance and rent and petrol, and of course petrol is impacted by the global oil price \u2013 and all this uncertainty we\u2019re seeing in the Middle East,\u201d Chalmers told ABC TV on Tuesday. \u201cNone of those factors are about government spending.\u201d Research out this week from the ANZ senior economist Blair Chapman noted much of this year\u2019s inflation pulse was driven by so-called administered or indexed prices, such as university fees. These were immune from higher interest rates in the near term. \u201cNon-administered and non-indexed inflation has declined notably and is running around levels consistent with the RBA\u2019s target band on a six-month annualised basis,\u201d Chapman said. In the March quarter, such items rose 3.3% year-on-year, down from a peak of 9%. In other words, an RBA rate rise \u201cwould likely slow activity in interest rate-sensitive sectors, slow employment growth and add to unemployment\u201d. More reason to hold fire, then. Unless those CPI numbers light the fuse."

            "date": "2024-07-21T09:50:34Z",
            "content": "Rachel Reeves has indicated that the government could agree above-inflation pay rises for teachers and other public sector workers, saying there is \u201ca cost to not settling\u201d pay negotiations. The chancellor, who did not dispute reports that independent pay review bodies for teachers and NHS staff had advised increases of about 5.5% \u2013 higher than the current 2% inflation rate \u2013 said she would set out full details later in July. While Reeves\u2019s tone will be welcomed by unions, the cost of such rises, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimating that a 5.5% increase across all public sector professions would cost about \u00a310bn, would place huge pressure on the government\u2019s tight fiscal rules. Speaking to BBC One\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Reeves said she was willing to make tough decisions neglected by the last government, saying the pay recommendation for teachers had been sitting unaddressed on the desk of the previous education secretary, Gillian Keegan. \u201cAt the moment, we are looking at these pay review body recommendations, doing the analysis,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cWe will work with public sector workers on that. And later this month we will make announcements around public sector pay when we do that full analysis of the public finances and public spending. \u201cBut we also know that there is a cost to not settling \u2013 a cost of further industrial action, a cost in terms of the challenge that we face in recruiting retaining doctors and nurses and teachers as well. But we\u2019ll do it in a proper way. Make sure that the sums add up.\u201d According to IFS estimates reported in the Sunday Telegraph, paying an extra 5.5% to teachers and nurses would cost \u00a35.5bn, rising to about \u00a310bn if the same increase took place for all public sector staff. Acknowledging that she faced \u201chuge spending pressures\u201d, Reeves also hinted that the government would take account of the independent status of the pay review bodies, rather than often rejecting their recommendations, as sometimes took place under the Conservatives. She said the government would do things \u201cin a proper way\u201d, highlighting the need for greater economic growth to improve the fiscal situation. Jeremy Hunt, the shadow chancellor, told the BBC it was \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d for Reeves to suggest Labour had inherited a particularly terrible economic situation and rejected the idea that the Conservatives had dodged difficult decisions. \u201cYou have interviewed me on many occasions over the years and you can criticise me for many things, but not taking tough and difficult decisions is one thing I don\u2019t think people would level at me,\u201d Hunt said, while not denying that his government received the teachers\u2019 pay review recommendation before the election was called. On Sky\u2019s Trevor Philips on Sunday show, James Murray, a junior Treasury minister, refused to be drawn on what would be done about public sector pay, beyond saying Reeves would \u201cset out our response in the context of the public finances and the public spending inheritance that we have in government\u201d. He added: \u201cI think what\u2019s not helpful for me to do for any worker in the public sector is for me to pre-empt the process that we are going through right now.\u201d Reeves refused to say when or if ministers may abolish the two-child limit on working age benefits, a key driver of child poverty about which Keir Starmer faces a looming backbench rebellion, saying it was impossible without knowing where the \u00a33bn annual cost would come from. \u201cI am going to run our economy with iron discipline, bringing back stability, because we haven\u2019t had stability,\u201d she said. Reeves lambasted what she called the inaction of the previous government, citing the example of Keegan. \u201cThe Conservative former education secretary, she had the pay review body recommendation for teachers on her desk when she was in office. \u201cShe didn\u2019t do anything about it. She didn\u2019t publish it. She didn\u2019t say how she was going to respond to it. They called an election. They didn\u2019t make the tough decisions. They ran away from them.\u201d Similarly, Reeves said, a planning decision on an energy infrastructure project was ignored because the then energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, \u201cwasn\u2019t willing to make those difficult decisions\u201d."

            "date": "2024-07-17T11:52:04Z",
            "content": "Inflation is back down to more normal levels. But at the Bank of England, there are concerns that the battle to keep it close to the 2% target set by the government has yet to be decisively won. Official figures from June show the headline measure remained bang on target for a second month in a row, raising hopes that the worst of the inflationary burst after the exit from Covid lockdowns and the Russian invasion of Ukraine has passed. After the Bank hiked interest rates 14 times, to 5.25% \u2013 the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 to fight inflation, there have been hopes for some time that a return to more normal levels could warrant a cut in official borrowing costs. Having come down from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022, signs of stability in consumer price growth will come as welcome relief to households and businesses. However, the cost of living still remains significantly higher than three years ago, and the Bank is worried that inflation will bump back above its target within months. Of most concern to Threadneedle Street will be signs of stubborn inflationary pressure in the services sector \u2013 one of the key areas the Bank has said it closely monitors when considering whether to sanction a rate cut. The latest figures showed services inflation held steady at 5.7%, a blow for those advocating a cut. The ONS said three main sub-sectors were contributing to the sticky levels of price growth: restaurants and cafes, rents and hotels. Some economists said this could be down to Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour landing in Britain last month, triggering a boom in demand for hotels and other consumer-facing services as Swifties flocked to concert venues across the UK. For stubborn inflation, read: \u201cIt\u2019s me, hi, I\u2019m the problem, it\u2019s me?\u201d The ONS isn\u2019t so sure. The government statisticians logged many of the prices in their dataset before the concerts took place, while its samples were taken from hotels across the country, not just in places where Taylormania had taken hold. There may have been some evidence of Swift\u2019s impact in inflation in hotels, where average price growth rose from 7% in May to 9.8% in June. But cultural services inflation, which would capture ticket prices, dipped from 7.4% to 7.3%. Financial markets are, however, taking a cue that domestic inflationary pressures could prove more persistent than hoped. The chances of the Bank cutting rates at its next policy meeting on 1 August have slipped from about 50% to close to 35%, while the pound strengthened to a one-year high, breaking through $1.30 on the global currency markets. Several members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, including its chief economist, Huw Pill, have warned in the past week that service sector inflation and a tight jobs market could force Threadneedle Street to take a cautious approach. Official figures from the jobs market are due to be published on Thursday, giving the central bank plenty of time to come up with a view before its next meeting. Some economists, however, believe that when it comes to signs of inflation persistence in the service sector, the Bank should shake it off. Goods prices, and in particular durable goods prices, remain firmly in deflation. Producer price inflation \u2013 reflecting factory gate prices, which can act as a guide to future consumer prices \u2013 was also weaker than expected. With concerns that high interest rates are weighing heavily on the economy and households unnecessarily, there will be growing demands for a cut in borrowing costs."

            "date": "2024-07-29T15:00:41Z",
            "content": "Perhaps the most important data release in more than two years will land on Wednesday, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics releasing the June quarter inflation figures. Here\u2019s why the consumer price index (CPI) and other inflation numbers are being more closely watched since the Reserve Bank of Australia started hoisting interest rates in May 2022 and what the results might mean. Why is this data batch so important? The RBA wants inflation back within a 2-3% target range by the end of 2025 and the June quarter data might reveal a stalling of that trajectory. If so, the central bank may decide hiking interest rates is needed to ensure inflation resumes its retreat. After the RBA\u2019s most recent board meeting in June, the bank\u2019s governor, Michele Bullock, said the central bank was \u201cvigilant\u201d in watching for proof that inflation wasn\u2019t receding fast enough. But Australia\u2019s in \u201cquite a complex situation\u201d, Bullock said. Pundits demanding another rate hike \u2013 it\u2019s been 4.35% since last November \u2013 were \u201cmuch more definite\u201d than she was but \u201cit\u2019s not as easy as that\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup ABS figures since then, including May\u2019s monthly CPI reading that rose to 4% for the first time in 2024, have helped make things clearer. The jobless rate also nudged up to 4.1% in June, even as the economy added more than 50,000. The ABS only surveys price changes each month for part of the 87 categories of goods and services that make up the basket. That\u2019s why the RBA treats them \u201cwith a bargepole\u201d (as one former senior economist put it), viewing the quarterly numbers as more comprehensive. What\u2019s expected? In May, the RBA forecast June quarter inflation would be 3.8% for both the so-called headline CPI and the trimmed mean. The latter strips away 15% from the top and bottom of the most volatile price movers to approximate \u201ccore\u201d inflation. In the March quarter, CPI and trimmed mean were 3.6% and 4%, respectively. Both have been sinking since scaling three-decade peaks of 7.8% and 6.8% at the end of 2022. Private economists reckon the June quarter CPI will match the RBA\u2019s prediction but the core reading will remain steady at 4%, according to Bloomberg. If that\u2019s the outcome, investors will probably lift the odds of an interest rate rise to 4.6% \u2013 which are now about a one-in-five chance \u2013 when the RBA board meets next week. All four major commercial banks currently expect the next RBA move will be a rate cut. Are governments making the RBA\u2019s job easier or harder? Governments are tending to stoke demand rather than chill it, such as the Albanese government\u2019s stage-three tax cuts that will inject about $23bn into the economy this year, or hefty (extra) energy rebates by Labor counterparts in Queensland and Western Australia. All three have to go to elections within the next 10 months and can\u2019t ignore voters\u2019 pleas for help to deal with cost of living increases. Some of the support, though, will go to (mostly older, mortgage-free) people who need it less. Treasurers and their Treasuries, though, argue the economy would have stalled without these injections. The other half of the RBA\u2019s mandate is to secure full employment and it doesn\u2019t want to send households and businesses to the wall if it can avoid it. The RBA\u2019s models already anticipate a spending jump will follow tax cuts. It also seems to have accepted Treasury arguments rebates serve to \u201cmechanically\u201d lower CPI, and in the process reduce demand in the economy buy cutting CPI-indexed payments such as pensions. \u201cEnergy rebates and rent assistance would lower headline inflation in 2024, though this direct effect would be reversed later in 2025 [should the rebates not be extended],\u201d the RBA said in its June meeting minutes. Economists such as Steven Hamilton are sceptical. \u201cBy lowering prices, the energy rebate increases households\u2019 real incomes, boosting aggregate demand and inflation,\u201d he wrote in the AFR in May. The RBA will update its assessment of budget inflationary effects for its August meeting including, presumably, some early hint of how much of those tax cuts are getting spent. What are central banks overseas doing? Those calling for another interest rate rise argue that Australia was relatively slow to start hiking our cash rate and it hasn\u2019t risen as much as peers abroad. That might be technically true but the RBA\u2019s twin mandate and the fact its inflation target is lower than the US or New Zealand with their 2% or lower goals allows it to be more flexible and patient. There is also proof Australia\u2019s treatment of housing costs has stoked the CPI inflation measure here while moderating it in nations such as the US, Canada and the UK. As it happens, overseas counterparts have lately shifted to cutting rates or will do so soon. Canada lowered its key interest rate in June and July, the European Central Bank cut in June and the US Federal Reserve is widely expected to start reducing rates in September. Falling overseas borrowing costs would take some of the pressure off the RBA to hike again if the Australian dollar strengthens, making imports cheaper. What are wild cards to watch? Core inflation may be the RBA\u2019s primary focus but the central bank won\u2019t ignore what headline CPI numbers do to inflationary expectations of households and businesses alike. Housing makes up about 21.75% of the CPI basket, of which rents account for about six percentage points and the cost of new houses just over eight percentage points. The tight housing market in most capital cities and labour shortages suggest this component of inflation won\u2019t ease much any time soon. Despite heightened media attention, electricity is 2.36% of the basket, with gas accounting for just under 1%. By contrast, transport fuel at almost 3.75%, garners much less attention. Some service price increases will also remain elevated, with insurance costs rising 3% in the June quarter alone, the Commonwealth Bank has noted. That\u2019s down at least from 3.7% in the March quarter, but suggests the sector will continue to be a propellant for price increases. Some food prices are also rebounding. Volatile food and vegetable prices may increase as much as 7% for the quarter, led by lamb, the bank forecasts. Much to chew on, in other words."

            "content": "Time for a recap. Economic storm clouds are gathering over Germany again, after growth fell into reverse and inflation rose. German GDP fell by 0.1% in the second quarter of this year, new economic data shows, putting Europe\u2019s largest economy on the brink of recession. Analysts warned that Germany is the growth laggard of the eurozone, although Latvia (-1.1%), Sweden (-0.8%) and Hungary (-0.2%) all shrank by more. ABN Amro explains: German Q1 GDP undershot expectations, contracting by 0.1% qoq (consensus and our forecast +0.1% qoq) after expanding by 0.2% qoq in Q1 The details will be published late August. For now, Destatis pointed to fixed investment, particularly in transport equipment and buildings as the main drag on GDP growth. Indeed, investment in Germany has been generally weak with the level of investment still lagging 2019 levels by about 4%; this is especially the case for investment in transport equipment such as cars. Furthermore, investment in buildings declined after being a source of strength in the Q1 GDP reading. This is not a surprise given the continued high level of interest rates, which have depressed demand and activity in the construction sector, particularly housing. German inflation, on a harmonised basis, rose to 2.6% this month. The drop in Germany\u2019s GDP took the shine of a solid, unspectacular, growth performance by the wider eurozone, which expanded by 0.3% in April-June. Spain was a bright light, growing by 0.8%, while France expanded by 0.3% \u2013 helped by the sale of a massive cruise ship to Royal Caribbean. Analysts at Nomura say: Euro area Q2 2024 GDP grew by 0.3% q-o-q. Core/periphery divergence continues, worsening even, with Germany contracting and Spain materially outperforming. In other news\u2026. Climate activists have voiced anger after BP beat profit expectations, and hiked its dividend. Drinks company Diageo has been hit by a slump in demand in Latin America, cancelling out a jump in demand for its no-alcohol Guinness 0.0%. Bakery chain Greggs has raised some prices, as it passes on the cost of a higher wage bill. Pfizer has raised its profit guidance, as it shrugged off a drop in revenues from its Covid produces. The number of job openings in the US has fallen slightly. After falling sharply this morning, London\u2019s blue-chip stocks have clawed their way back, mostly. The FTSE 100 share index has ended the day down 18 points, or 0.2%, at 8274 points. Standard Chartered led the risers, after announcing its biggest ever share buyback this morning. But medical device maker Convatec was the top faller, down 5.8%, after missing profit expectations. The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies jumped 0.85%, led by wealth manager St James\u2019s Place (+25%) after it outlined cost-cutting plans. Trouble is mounting in the UK water industry, where Moody\u2019s is threatening to downgrade Southern Water to a \u2018junk\u2019 rating. SW (Finance) I PLC (Southern Water) is currently rated at Baa3 \u2013 the lowest investment-grade rating. Moody\u2019s has now placed its bonds on review for a possible downgrade. Moody\u2019s says: \u201cThe review for downgrade reflects our expectation that Ofwat\u2019s draft determination would, if not materially changed... result in severe Outcome Delivery Incentive (ODI) penalties and total expenditure (totex) allowances below the level needed to fund Southern Water\u2019s investment programme. \u201cTogether with an allowed return that falls significantly short of Southern Water\u2019s actual cost of capital, such under-performance may challenge the company\u2019s ability to raise equity finance to maintain leverage at levels consistent with the current rating.\u201d Southern Water is subject to enforcement monitoring by regulator Ofwat after a record \u00a3126m fine in 2019 over \u201cshocking\u201d failures at the company\u2019s sewage treatment sites that polluted rivers and beaches in southern England. Last week, Moody\u2019s downgraded Thames Water\u2019s credit rating to \u201cjunk\u201d status, adding to pressure on the English water company\u2019s finances. Pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer has lifted its profit forecast after recording its first rise in revenues since the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Pfizer grew its revenues by 2% year-on-year to $13.28bn, despite a drop in revenues from Covid products, as demand for its heart disease drug and its cancer therapy Padcev rise. David Denton, Pfizer\u2019s chief financial officer and executive vice president, says: \u201cThis was Pfizer\u2019s first quarter of topline revenue growth, on a year-over-year basis, since the fourth quarter of 2022 when our COVID revenues peaked. The company now expects annual profit to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, up from a prior profit forecast of $2.15 to $2.35 per share. Pfizer also says it\u2019s on track to cut costs by at least $4bn by the end of the year, through its \u201cCost Realignment Program\u201d. Microsoft has said it is investigating reports of users having problems accessing its services, with some reporting being unable to access email and other functions, PA Media reports. An alert on the technology giant\u2019s service status website said it is looking into a \u201cnetwork infrastructure\u201d issue. According to website status platform DownDetector, users of Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Xbox Live and players of popular video game Minecraft were among those reporting issues. The incident comes less than two weeks after a major IT outage knocked global infrastructure including transport and healthcare services offline because a flawed software update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike affected Microsoft devices. On its service status website, Microsoft said: \u201cWe are investigating reports of issues connecting to Microsoft services globally. \u201cCustomers may experience timeouts connecting to Azure services. We have multiple engineering teams engaged to diagnose and resolve the issue. More details will be provided as soon as possible.\u201d UK auditors BDO and Forvis Mazars have been urged to improve the quality of their audit work. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has today flagged the gap between the Big Four accountancy and BDO and Mazars. In its Annual Review of Audit Quality, the FRC says 74% of audits were categorised as good or requiring limited improvements. The big firms did well, with Deloitte at 94%, EY 76%, KPMG 89% and PwC 76%. But, the audit results for BDO have declined from 69% to 38% year on year, while Forvis Mazars\u2019 results also declined from 56% to 44%. The regulator says: While inspections are based on a risk-based sample, and should not be extrapolated to all of the audits undertaken by both firms, the results do not meet the FRC\u2019s expectations. Given their strategic importance to the audit market, both firms must urgently address the causes of these declines and undertake significant audit quality improvement plans which will be closely monitored by the FRC. Just in: the number of job openings across the US economy has dropped slightly, as its labour market slackens a little. There were 8.184m job opportunies in the US at the end of June, down from 8.23m at the end of May, and 941,000 fewer than a year earlier. The job openings rate held at 4.9 percent in June. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says: Job openings increased in accommodation and food services (+120,000) and in state and local government, excluding education (+94,000). The number of job openings decreased in durable goods manufacturing (-88,000) and in federal government (-62,000) On Wall Street, stocks have made a positive start as trading begins in New York. The S&amp;P 500 share index has risen by 10 points, or 0.2%, to 5,473 points, while the Dow Jones industrial average has gained 0.4%. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite is flat, with cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike losing 7%, as it faces calls for compensation following the IT outage this month that caused millions of computers to crash. Microsoft users have been reporting more problems today, with an outage affecting Azure network infrastructure customers. Microsoft\u2019s share are up 0.4%, though, ahead of its latest financial results tonight. Oil prices have weakened today, weighed down by worries about demand from China, the world\u2019s largest oil importer. Brent crude has dropped by 1.35% to $78.70 per barrel, while US crude is 1.1% lower at $74.87. Joseph Dahrieh, managing principal at brokerage Tickmill, explains: Slower-than-expected economic growth in China as well as declining oil imports have weighed on sentiment. In addition, the planned removal of part of OPEC+\u2019s production cuts could intensify the bearish sentiment. Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, has responded to the CMA\u2019s probe into its partnership with AI firm Anthropic (see earlier post). A Google spokesperson said: \u201cGoogle is committed to building the most open and innovative AI ecosystem in the world. \u201cAnthropic is free to use multiple cloud providers and does, and we don\u2019t demand exclusive tech rights.\u201d Over in the US, home prices have stagnated. US house prices were unchanged in May, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, following a 0.3% rise in April. During May, prices fell by 0.5% in the West North Central division, but gained 0.3% in the New England division. \u201cUS house price movement was flat in May,\u201d said Dr. Anju Vajja, Deputy Director for FHFA\u2019s Division of Research and Statistics, adding: \u201cThe slowdown in U.S. house price appreciation continued in May amid a slight rise in both mortgage rates and housing inventory.\u201d On an annual basis, house prices rose 5.7% compared with May 2023. We also have growth figures from Mexico, which are a little weaker than expected. Mexico\u2019s economy grew by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in April-June, missing forecasts for 0.3% growth. The UK\u2019s Takeover Panel has doled out its harshest penalty for a code breach, after a long investigation into the company which once owned boutique hotel chains Malmaison and Hotel du Vin. The Panel has concluded that ten parties should be \u201ccold-shouldered\u201d, a move which effectively bars them from any takeover-related activity, including buying or selling shares during a live takeover period. The Panel found that several executives of MWB Group Holdings had acquired shares in the company which, when added to the shares held by a pre-existing concert party, meant they controlled more than half its share capital \u2013 which would, if disclosed, force them to make a formal takeover bid. Omar Faruqui, Director General of the Panel, explains: \u201cToday\u2019s ruling concludes the most complex investigation in the Panel\u2019s 56-year history. Ten individuals have been cold-shouldered. They misled MWB Group shareholders and the market through a web of sham transactions and false trails stretching across many jurisdictions. Exposing their deceit and wrong-doing is testament to the skill and determination of the Panel\u2019s enforcement team.\u201d The ruling, which runs to over 100 pages, is online here. The Panel also decided that three members of management, including former MWB CEO Richard Balfour-Lynn, should pay compensation to shareholders, and has rejected an appeal from Balfour-Lynn. It has also publicly censured Andrew Blurton, a joint finance director of MWB at the time of some of the events in question. MWB entered administration in November 2012 and was liquidated on 15 April 2018. The slight increase in German inflation this month (see last post) not only highlights the stickiness of inflation but also suggests that a September rate cut by the European Central Bank is not a done deal, yet, says ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski Another blow for Germany \u2013 its inflation rate has risen. Inflation, on an EU-harmonised basis, rose to 2.6% per year in July, up from 2.5% in June, statistics body Destatis reports. Britain\u2019s competition watchdog has kicked off another probe into the artificial intelligence sector. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is examining whether Alphabet\u2019s partnership with AI start-up Anthropic has created a \u201cmerger situation\u201d, and if so wheter it weakens competition. This is the latest in a series of moves by the CMA. Earlier this month it began a full investigation into Microsoft\u2019s deal with AI startup Inflection, and in April it began seeking views on Amazon\u2019s investment in Anthropic, which is a leading rival to OpenAI. Other regulators also have concerns; in January, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft received inquiries from the US Federal Trade Commission on their investments and partnerships with Anthropic and OpenAI. Getting back to today\u2019s eurozone growth figures, Moody\u2019s Analytics economist Ross Cioffi has warned that the outlook for the region for the rest of this year is \u201cprecarious\u201d. Cioffi explains: Preliminary estimates reported a 0.3% quarter-on-quarter expansion of Eurozone GDP in the second quarter of 2024. Most major economies grew more strongly than we had been expecting, with the notable exception of Germany, which was worse off. Spain\u2019s second quarter was well-rounded, with solid increases in domestic and foreign demand. France gained from both home and abroad, as well, though only to a minor extent with private consumption on the decline, while Italy was bolstered mostly on domestic demand. In Germany, the weak spot was fixed investments. The outlook for the Eurozone economy remains precarious for the rest of the year, with modest growth at best, as prices and interest rates remain high, and weak sentiment keep things cool, before picking up steam next year. A major probe into whether people overpaid on their car loans has been extended by the UK\u2019s financial watchdog. The Financial Conduct Authority now expects to set out the next steps in its review into the past use of discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) in May 2025, having previously aimed to do this by the end of September. The FCA says: We\u2019re working hard to understand how DCAs affected the cost of credit for people borrowing money to buy a vehicle. We\u2019re assessing thousands of records spanning 14 years. The FCA\u2019s investigation centres on the car loans market, and whether commission payments to brokers were too high. Those brokers were able to adjust the interest rates they charged customers, and some received \u201cdiscretionary commission arrangements\u201d, which meant they were paid more if the interest rate was higher. The FCA says today that firms involved in our review have engaged constructively with the regulator, but many have struggled to supply data within the requested time. Another wrinkle is that Barclays Partner Finance has begun judicial review proceedings of the Financial Ombudsman Service\u2019s decision to uphold a complaint relating to its use of a DCA. Thousands of car loan customers who took out loans before 2021 have been complaining to lenders and brokers. The FCA says today it could bring in a redress scheme, so it is asking firms to pause complaint handling until 4 December 2025. Shares in Close Brothers, which has provided motor finance deals, are down around a third since January, when the FCA announced it was investigating the market. JP Morgan is still bullish on the outlook for the UK stock market. In a new research note, its analysts say the backdrop for UK equities is \u201clooking favourable\u201d. They cite attractive valuations, improved political clarity and potentially lower bond yields, which all make dividend yields more attractive again. JP Morgan is maintain its recommendation to remain \u2018overweight\u2019 on UK stocks. They explain: The elections event risk is behind us, and the new government is likely to provide more fiscal credibility and stability, with focus on domestic agenda, homebuilding and the consumer. Broadly, the beneficiaries stand to be Banks, Homebuilders, Real Estate and Utilities, while on the negative side we have Diversified Financials, E&amp;P and Transportation. Within the UK, we have a preference for Domestic over Exporters plays, as GBP is firmer, for UK consumer plays, and for Real Estate and Homebuilders - these typically start performing once the rate cuts begin. In the car world, Tesla is updating the software on more than 1.8 million vehicles in the US to fix a problem that stops unlatched bonnets being detected. Tesla has started rolling out an over-the-air software update to detect the open bonnet and send a notification to customers, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said today. If a bonnet, or hood, was not locked properly, it could fully open while a car is being operated, blocking the driver\u2019s view. The pound is holding firm on the foreign exchanges this morning, unchanged at $1.286 against the US dollar. But, sterling could weaken on Thursday if the Bank of England decides to cut interest rates from their current 16-year high. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, says: \u201cThe Bank of England\u2019s August policy announcement appears on a knife-edge, and one of the tougher rate decisions to predict for some time. We expect the MPC to deliver a 25 basis point cut on Thursday, albeit the vote on rates appears almost too close to call, and could be evenly split between the hawks and doves. On balance, we think that we\u2019ve seen enough progress on inflation for those members that were close to voting for a cut in June to shift their allegiance in favour of the doves. There is, however, a high degree of uncertainty surrounding this view, particularly given the lack of communications from MPC members since the June meeting, in part due to the blackout period surrounding the general election. Currently, the money markets indicate there\u2019s a 59% chance of a rate cut on Thursday. Ryan adds: As this is not yet fully priced in, an immediate rate reduction would likely trigger some downside in the pound, albeit an upbeat set of communications, particularly a sizable upward revision to the GDP forecasts, could limit the extent of any sell-off.\u201d In the UK, the Bank of England has created a new cost benefit analysis panel to provide advice when new rules are proposed for firms and financial market infrastructures. It is chaired by Laurel Powers-Freeling, who is also the chair of Uber UK. Sam Woods, Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation and Chief Executive Officer of the PRA, said: \u201cCost benefit analysis is an essential part of policy development, and I\u2019m delighted that we\u2019ve been able to attract such a strong panel to help ensure that we do the best job we can in this vital area.\u201d Away from Europe, credit rating agency S&amp;P has downgraded Bangladesh\u2019s credit ratings to B+ from BB-, nearly two weeks after the government imposed a curfew to quell deadly student protests. S&amp;P cited a sustained decline in Bangladesh\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, which it says shows there is persistent pressure on the country\u2019s external metrics. Earlier this month, the Bangladeshi government declared a national curfew and announced plans to deploy the army to tackle the country\u2019s worst unrest in a decade, with AFP reporting that at least 105 people have died in the unrest. The protests began this month on university campuses as students demanded an end to a quota system that reserves 30% of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh\u2019s war of independence in 1971. Those protesting have argued that the policy is unfair and discriminatory as young people struggle for jobs during an economic downturn and instead benefits members of the ruling Awami League party, which is led by the Hasina. The drop in German GDP in the last quarter is a worry, says Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets: The trajectory of the German economy remains a concern for Europe, with the manufacturing powerhouse seeing second quarter growth fall back into negative territory (-0.1%). Fortunately, things are more stable for the eurozone as a whole, with the latest GDP figure beating expectations to post a second consecutive 0.3% reading in Q2. Pushpin Singh, senior economist at the CEBR think tank, predicts the eurozone\u2019s growth prospects will improve this year: \u201cFlash estimates from Eurostat indicate that the Eurozone economy grew by 0.3% on the quarter in Q2. This rate was above consensus expectations and matched the corresponding growth rate seen in Q1. The stronger-than-expected growth rate suggests the bloc has turned a corner since the start of the year. Prospects are likely to improve further throughout the year, driven by recent policy loosening by the European Central Bank and expectations for further interest rate cuts down the line. Cebr expects the Eurozone economy to expand by 0.8% in 2024, up from 2023\u2019s growth figure of 0.4%.\u201d The eurozone only grew half as quickly as the US in the last quarter. GDP data last week showed that the US economy grew at a 2.8% annualised rate in the second quarter of 2024, or the equivalent of 0.7% quarterly growth. Today\u2019s eurozone growth report is \u201cmoderate but decent\u201d, says Frederik Engholm, head of Macro &amp; Strategy at Nykredit. Just in: The eurozone grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of this year, a little faster than expected, despite the economic problems in Germany. Statistics body Eurostat has just reported that GDP increased by 0.3% in both the euro area and the EU in the April-June quarter, which matches the growth recorded in the first quarter of this year. Economists had expected growth to slow to 0.2% in Q2, so this is a little better than expected. Ireland (+1.2%) recorded the highest increase compared to the previous quarter, followed by Lithuania (+0.9%) and Spain (+0.8%), while France grew by 0.3% and Italy and Belgium both expanded by 0.2%. The highest declines were recorded in Latvia (-1.1%), Sweden (-0.8%) and Hungary (-0.2%), while Germany\u2019s 0.1% fall in GDP also dragged on growth. The news that Germany\u2019s GDP shrank in April-June (see 9.20am) shows how hard it will be to escape the cyclical and structural headwinds hitting its economy, says Carsten Brzeski, Global Head of Macro at ING. He tells clients this morning that the German economy will continue to hover between hope and despair: With both the US and the Chinese economies losing momentum, along with new trade tensions, there is very little hope for a strong export-driven recovery. Also, weak industrial orders, high inventory levels and precautionary savings are still weighing on the economy. On top of that, the increasing number of insolvencies and individual company announcements of forthcoming job restructurings are still hanging like the Sword of Damocles over the labour market this year. However, despite a weak start to the second half of the year, don\u2019t rule out potential positive surprises. In fact, extremely weak May data could have been exaggerated due to many public holidays and long weekends. Plus, only a small improvement in industrial order books is needed to get industrial production growing again, admittedly from low levels. The highest increase in real wages in more than a decade should also loosen even German consumers\u2019 traditionally very tight wallets eventually. All in all, today\u2019s data once again confirms that Germany is the growth laggard of the eurozone. Caught between cyclical and structural headwinds, there is no easy way out of this long stagnation. Nevertheless, a rebound in the second half of the year is still possible, even though it is highly unlikely that it will be a strong one. Portugal grew by a modest 0.1% in the last quarter, new data shows. Statistics Portugal reports: The contribution of domestic demand to quarter-on-quarter rate of change of GDP became positive in the second quarter, with an increase of investment and a slowdown in private consumption. The contribution of net external demand became negative, with exports of goods and services having a nil rate of change. On an annual basis, Portugal\u2019s economy was 1.5% larger than a year ago. The picture is better in Italy, though, where the economy continues to grow. Italian GDP rose by 0.2% in the April-June quarter, the fourth quarter of growth in a row. Statistics body Istat reports that the services sector grew, while industry, and the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector, dragged on growth. Newsflash: Germany\u2019s economy is back on the brink of recession. Germany\u2019s GDP shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter of this year, new data from statistics body Destatis shows. That\u2019s a blow to Berlin\u2019s government, which has been hit by an ailing train network, the surge in energy prices after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, protests by farmers, weaker demand from China, and a rise in support for far-right politicians. Economists had expected growth of 0.1% in the quarter. The decline in activity was due to a fall in manufacturing and construction investments. Destatis reports that \u201cinvestments in equipment and buildings, adjusted for price, seasonal and calendar effects, in particular decreased\u201d in the last quarter. The drop in GDP in the last quarter follows 0.2% growth in the first quarter of 2024. A technical recession is defined as two quartery contractions in a row. This takes the shine off a decent start to today\u2019s eurozone growth data, with both Spain (+0.8%) and France (+0.3%) beating expectations\u2026.. Here\u2019s our news story on BP\u2019s latest profits: France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno le Maire, has predicted that growth could beat the outgoing government\u2019s forecast this year. He welcomed the better-than-expected 0.3% rise in GDP reported this morning, telling reporters: \u201cWe will probably have growth after all that is better than the 1% forecast in February. \u201cFor two years, France has outperformed; our economic policies work and are giving tangible results.\u201d We flagged earlier that a ship delivery boosted France\u2019s exports in the last quarter. Reuters is now reporting that the vessel in question is the Utopia of the Seas cruise ship, which was delivered to Royal Caribbean. The ship, which cost over \u00a31bn, helped to lift France\u2019s transport equipment exports by +1.8%, and overall exports by 0.6%. The Daily Mail recently took a trip on Utopia of the Seas \u2013 they report it includes five pools, a zip line, an aqua park, a surf simulator, and an on-board train. High street bakery chain Greggs is putting up some of its prices, after its pay bill was pushed up by the rise in the minimum wage this year. Greggs\u2019s CEO Roisin Currie has told the PA news agency that the company has increased the prices of some items on its menu by 5p and 10p in recent weeks, but has kept meal deal prices unchanged. Currie \u2013 who said in March that price rises weren\u2019t planned \u2013 says prices were raised to offset higher pay for its 32,000-strong workforce, having raised salaries earlier this year ahead of the increase in the National Living Wage. She said: \u201cThe biggest inflation cost right now is the increase in the National Living Wage and making sure our employees get the wage increases that are appropriate. \u201cThat puts pressure on the cost increases within the business.\u201d Estate agent Foxtons has reported that this month\u2019s general election has had little impact on customer behaviour or market dynamics. Foxtons says trading in July is in line with expectations, after revenues rose by 11% in the first six months of 2024. Pre-tax profits jumped by almost a quarter, to \u00a37.5m. CEO Guy Gittins says: \u201cThe strong momentum we started the year with has continued, with double-digit revenue and earnings growth and our position as London\u2019s largest Lettings and Sales agency reinforced. \u201cDespite macro headwinds and the election interruption, we continued to outperform the market, delivering strong Sales revenue growth of 28% and market share growth of 30%. Growth was also delivered in Lettings, with a double-digit increase in new business volumes, further bolstered by the acquisitions we made in 2023. Bank CEOs have largely welcomed prime minister Kier Starmer\u2019s government with open arms, cheering the country\u2019s economic trajectory and political stability after years of uncertainty. And the boss of the London-headquartered but emerging markets-focused lender, Standard Chartered, is no exception. Bill Winters told journalists this morning that Labour appeared to be a \u201cserious government\u201d that was supportive of business and ready to tackle fiscal challenges that have dogged the UK economy. He said: The new Labour Government is a serious government and they\u2019ve set out a series of serious statements and platforms, including what the chancellor said yesterday in terms of addressing some of the fiscal challenges that we know are very present in the country. The rhetoric during the election period and in the early days of the government has been supportive of business. I think it\u2019s been tempered by realism about the economic challenges and the fiscal challenges that the UK faces. But I have every confidence that the Chancellor and the rest of the government will pursue their policies in a very thoughtful, open and transparent way. And that\u2019s as much as we could ask. Winters added that he was \u201chappy\u201d to be headquartered in the UK, which he described as having a robust regulatory environment, a \u201cvery stable political environment\u201d and \u201cextraordinarily good rule of law\u201d and corporate governance, adding: \u201cSo there\u2019s certainly nothing that has changed in terms of our views on the attractiveness of the Labour government\u201d. His comments came as the bank raised its earnings outlook, and announced its largest-ever share buyback worth $1.5bn. It sent Standard Chartered\u2019s FTSE 100-listed shares up 5.3% at the start of trading. Shares in drinks giant Diageo have sunk to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, down 8%, after reporting a drop in sales and profits. Diageo, whose brands include Johnnie Walker, Captain Morgan, Guinness, Smirnoff and Baileys, posted a 1.4% drop in reported net sales in the year to the end of June, to $20.3bn. Pre-tax profits dropped to \u00a35.46bn, from \u00a35.64bn a year earlier. CEO Debra Crew told shareholders that the last financial year had been a challenging one for Diageo and the wider industry, due to \u201ccontinued macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility\u201d. Crew added: Fiscal 24 was impacted by materially weaker performance in LAC [the Latin America and Caribbean region]. Excluding LAC, organic net sales grew 1.8%, driven by resilient growth in our Africa, Asia Pacific and Europe regions. This offset the decline in North America, which was attributable to a cautious consumer environment and the impact of lapping inventory replenishment in the prior year. Great Britain was a highlights for Diageo, though \u2013 net sales here grew by 5%, thanks to stronger demand for Guinness \u2013 including the zero-alcohol Guinness 0.0 drink. Diageo\u2019s shares are at a four-year low, hitting levels last seen in March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic forced pubs, bars and restaurants to close. Shares in BP have jumped by 2.6% in early trading, after its profits beat forecasts this morning. It\u2019s the second-highest riser on the FTSE 100 index, after Standard Chartered bank (+4.8%), which announced its largest-ever share buyback programme this morning after a rise in profits. Austria has bucked the trend, though, by reporting no growth in the last quarter: Newsflash: Spain\u2019s economy has also grown faster than expected in the last quarter. Spanish GDP expanded by a pacy 0.8% in Q2, the National Statistics Institute reports, comfortably beating forecasts of 0.5% growth. That matches Spain\u2019s growth in January-March. On an annual basis, Spain\u2019s economy grew 2.9% over the last year. Campaign groups are angered by BP\u2019s latest multi-billion dollar profits. Global Witness has calculated that BP had paid \u201ca staggering\u201d \u00a311.7bn to shareholders since June 2023 \u2013 when the world began a 12-month stint of temperatures 1.5C above the pre-fossil fuel era. After BP reported an underlying profit of $2.76bn this morning, Alice Harrison, head of Fossil Fuel Campaigns at Global Witness, says: \u201cAs the world faces record-breaking heat, most of us are desperate to see urgent action on the climate crisis. Unfortunately, it\u2019s clear that BP couldn\u2019t care less. While millions of us struggle with high temperatures and high bills, BP are raking in billions of profits, paying out massive dividends, and doubling down on dirty new oil and gas projects. Big oil companies like BP know their fossil fuel products are behind more deadly heatwaves, storms, and wildfires around the world, but instead of investing in clean energy, they are continuing to profit from people\u2019s misery. Fossil fuel companies like BP are turning a blind eye to climate breakdown, so now governments must act. Rather than propping up the climate-wrecking fossil fuel industry, we need them to make polluters pay for the damage they have already caused, and steer us towards a cleaner, greener future.\u201d Warm This Winter spokesperson Fiona Waters points out that BP has recently rowed back on some of its green energy plans: \u201cBP\u2019s obscene profits today and the fact they have made \u00a338.4bn since the start of the energy crisis shows they\u2019re not interested in turning off their oil and gas cash cow. They have rolled-back on their green pledges that would mean lower bills, an end to energy price shocks and would also help save the planet.\u201d Chiara Liguori, Oxfam GB\u2019s Senior Climate Justice Policy Advisor, says low-income countries desperately need help to handle the impact of the climate crisis: \u201cIt is inexcusable that BP, one of the world\u2019s most polluting and profitable fossil fuel companies, continues to rake in billions of pounds while low-income countries are in urgent need of funds to tackle the devastating impacts of the climate crisis despite doing the least to cause it. \u201cThe world can no longer afford fossil fuel companies putting short-term profits above people and planet. The costs of inaction are already here with deadly heat waves, wildfires, flooding and drought but it is people living in poverty who are left paying the highest price. On this morning\u2019s growth figures from France, economist Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macroeconomics points out that French food consumption fell in the last quarter, while consumption of gas and electricity, and cars, rose. Philip Jansen, the former chief executive of BT, has been appointed as the new chairman of advertising giant WPP. Jansen, who stood down as chief executive of BT in February after almost five years in the role, will join the board of the FTSE-listed WPP in September and formally take over as chair from January. \u201cPhilip brings a valuable blend of experience, from leading technology and consumer goods companies to transforming large, complex organisations and creating significant value for shareholders,\u201d said Angela Ahrendts, senior independent director at WPP. Jansen, who began his career at Gillette to Ariel maker Procter and Gamble before moving into marketing director roles at Dunlop Slazenger and Telewest, led a BT turnaround strategy that included cutting 55,000 jobs by 2030 and investing \u00a315bn in the nationwide roll out of full fibre broadband and 5G mobile networks. Earlier this month, Jansen, who took home a bumper \u00a33.7m in pay and bonuses in his lat year at the telecoms company, was linked with a private equity backed takeover bid of British pest control firm Rentokil. \u201cTechnology is changing the face of commerce, media and communications, and I am very excited to join a company at the forefront of this change,\u201d said Jansen. Over the first half of this year, though, BP\u2019s profits are lower than a year ago. The oil giant made $5.479bn in January-June, down from $7.552bn in the first six months of 2023. That follows a drop in Q1 \u2013 when earnings shrank to $2.7bn from $5bn a year ago (as we covered in May). In the energy sector, BP has lifted its dividend after beating profit forecasts for the last quarter. BP has reported an underlying profit of $2.756bn for the second quarter of the financial year, up from $2.589bn in the same quarter in 2023, and slightly higher than the $2.723bn it earned in Q1. That beat analyst expectations of $2.6bn. BP said the profit was due to \u201can average\u201d performance in gas marketing and trading, lower refining margins, stronger fuels margins and \u201clower taxation\u201d. It adds: The underlying effective tax rate (ETR)* in the quarter was 33% which reflects the impact of the reassessment of the recognition of deferred tax assets. BP is raising its dividend to eight cents per share, up from 7.27/share. The oil giant has also announced another share buyback, worth $1.75bn, for the last quarter, as it continues to use spare cash to buy back equity. Kate Thomson, BP\u2019s chief financial officer, says: We generated strong operating cash flow in the quarter, which helped reduce net debt to $22.6 billion. Our decision to increase our dividend by 10%, and extend our buyback programme commitment to 4Q 2024, reflects the confidence we have in our performance and outlook for cash generation. We are maintaining a disciplined financial frame and remain committed to growing value and returns for bp. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. It\u2019s eurozone GDP day, when we learn how the countries which share the single currency are faring economically. And the early news is that France\u2019s economic growth was stronger than expected in the second quarter of this year. French GDP expanded by 0.3% in the April-June quarter, new data from statistics body INSEE shows, beating expectations for 0.2% growth. That matches the 0.3% growth recorded across the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy in the first quarter of the year. It suggests France\u2019s economy was stronger than expected this spring \u2013 before Emmanuel Macron stunned Europe by calling snap parliamentary elections last month. INSEE reports that domestic demand \u201cpicked up slightly\u201d, and added to growth. There was also a \u201cslight rebound\u201d in investment (or gross fixed capital formation). Household consumption was stable in the quarter, while foreign trade also made a positive contribution to growth. Exports grew by 0.6%, driven by a rise in transport equipment \u2013 which INSEE attributes to the \u201cdelivery of a new ship\u201d. INSEE has previously predicted that the Olympic Games\u2019 will lift France\u2019s economic growth in the third quarter of this year Economists predict that the wider eurozone also grew in the last quarter, by an estimated 0.2%. We\u2019ll find out if they\u2019re right at 10am, after getting growth figures from Italy, Spain and Germany too.

            "content": "The delivery of the world\u2019s second-largest cruise ship lifted France\u2019s economy in the second quarter, according to official data that also showed Germany heading into a recession. Built in Saint-Nazaire for the cruise ship operator Royal Caribbean, the Utopia of the Seas added \u20ac1bn (\u00a3840m) to French economic output, helping to increase trade growth to 0.6% in the three months to the end of June and gross domestic product to 0.3%. The eurozone grew by 0.3% in the third quarter after a revised rate of 0.3% in the first, prompting many analysts to say that the 20-member euro bloc has turned a corner after flirting with recession in 2023. Spain powered ahead with a 0.8% growth rate in the second quarter, while Italy\u2019s recovery was maintained by a 0.2% rise in GDP. Germany, the largest eurozone economy, slid back into contraction, recording a 0.1% fall in output. Pushpin Singh, a senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research consultancy, said the eurozone growth rate was better than expected by City analysts and \u201csuggests the bloc has turned a corner since the start of the year\u201d. He added: \u201cProspects are likely to improve further throughout the year, driven by recent policy loosening by the European Central Bank and expectations for further interest rate cuts down the line.\u201d Bert Colijn, a senior economist at the Dutch bank ING, was more concerned that German growth would become a significant drag on the eurozone. \u201cGermany remains the weak link in this post-pandemic economy but the rest is not fantastic either. \u201cLeave out Spain and you just have an economy that moves along at a lacklustre growth pace.\u201d France\u2019s economy grew marginally faster than expected and could improve again in the third quarter if the Olympics spur consumer spending, dispelling concerns that deadlock in the French parliament after recent elections would knock the economy off course. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said the economy\u2019s performance in the second quarter and the Paris Games meant growth this year would probably exceed the outgoing government\u2019s 1% forecast. \u201cWe will probably have growth after all that is better than the 1% forecast in February,\u201d Le Maire said. \u201cFor two years, France has outperformed; our economic policies work and are giving tangible results.\u201d He added that the better than expected growth could be positive for the strained budget deficit and France needed to stay focused on reducing spending. Anja Sabine Heimann, an economist at HSBC Germany, said industrial orders were weak and German consumers were reluctant to spend, adding that the risks of a recession were \u201celevated\u201d. The country has suffered almost zero growth over the past two years and avoided a recession only by a whisker. Heimann said many of the ingredients of a slowdown were now in place. \u201cDomestic and foreign industrial orders continue to trend downwards \u2013 highlighting little support from industry in the near-term,\u201d she added. \u201cWith consumer prices nearly one-fifth above 2019 levels, even after recent strong nominal wage growth, German households have not yet recouped their spending power. \u201cConsequently, their spending scope is still somewhat constrained and there is unlikely going to be a large consumer spending spree.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-28T11:00:52Z",
            "content": "Savers are always on the lookout for the best interest rates and the UK seems like a good bet at the moment. In recent months, the pound has climbed in value against the euro and the dollar as economists speculate that UK interest rates will remain at 5.25% for longer than previously expected. While the odds of a cut in borrowing have shortened, with a narrow majority of City analysts expecting a reduction, few outside the Square Mile believe a change is imminent. If anything, Bank officials will send sterling to even greater heights when they signal, as seems likely, that a cut remains some way off. Suren Thiru, economics director of accountancy body the ICAEW, says he still expects the Bank to lower interest rates to 4.75% by the end of the year, but \u201can August rate cut is looking less likely\u201d. Charlie Bean, an economist at the London School of Economics and a former deputy governor of the Bank, says he will be surprised if the cost of borrowing was reduced this week. In March, the Bank\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) said falling inflation and a weak outlook for the economy meant it was on course to lower interest rates. The committee signalled three rate cuts this year and more to come in 2025. Then came figures showing a strong bounce back from last year\u2019s mild recession. According to the latest S&amp;P Global survey of the business sector, manufacturers and services companies are winning new orders and growing in confidence about the outlook for employment and profits. Adding to the sense that the economy was doing fine without lower borrowing costs, official figures for May and June revealed wages growth remained above 5.5% and firms that were laying off workers last year had begun to hire again. The Bank has a mandate from parliament to maintain inflation at about 2% over the longer term. And while the consumer prices index was 2% in May and June, there was concern that wage pressures would reverse the trend. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as fuel and food, is stuck above 3%. Worse, the services inflation figure, which track what businesses charge each, other remains persistently above 5%. Stephen Millard, deputy director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, says: \u201cThe question is whether we are seeing enough evidence to show inflation is going to stay low.\u201d He believes the Bank needs more time to assess the economic situation before beginning to reverse the 14 consecutive rate rises that took place between December 2021 and August last year. Bean says if he was still on the MPC, he would want more evidence that wages were going to fall and that services companies, which have passed on most of their cost increases to customers over the past two years, would stop doing so. The MPC publishes its latest quarterly assessment of the economic outlook on Thursday and is expected to revise upwards its growth forecast for this year and next. A rise from low to moderate growth is welcome news, but is likely to disguise a deteriorating situation in the labour market, which will be characterised by rising unemployment and, about six months from now, falling wages growth. While the overall economy is growing, there are large pockets of industry and the services sector suffering from financial distress, partly as a result of high interest bills. Consumers are also reluctant to spend and businesses are shy of making investment decisions while there is uncertainty about the path of interest rates. Thiru accuses of the Bank of \u201cdithering\u201d when the broad picture shows the UK\u2019s private sector is largely stagnant and desperately in need of lower borrowing costs. The European Central Bank has already cut rates and the US Federal Reserve is poised to follow suit. Thiru is among many analysts who argue that the UK badly needs a boost from lower borrowing costs. \u201cThere is a pressing need to cut rates given the level of stagnation in the economy,\u201d he says. At the last MPC meeting, only two members voted for a cut. With at least four members known to be reluctant to usher in cheaper money, the power falls to governor Andrew Bailey and the other two floating voters. If Bailey joins \u201cthe hawkish four\u201d, judging a further delay necessary, savers will cheer. Those who have accumulated debts will need to wait."

Gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of economic health \u2013 rose 2.8% in three months to June, the commerce department reported on Thursday, ahead of economists\u2019 expectations and up sharply from 1.4% in the first quarter. It comes as the presidential election campaign heightens scrutiny of the US economy. While Joe Biden touted the \u201cstrongest economy in the world\u201d as he announced his withdrawal from the race on Sunday, Donald Trump \u2013 who is running to replace him in the White House \u2013 has accused Biden of weakening the economy. In a statement, Biden said: \u201cWhen I took office, we were in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Today\u2019s GDP report makes clear we now have the strongest economy in the world.\u201d Biden said there was \u201cmore to do\u201d over the final six months of his term. \u201cThe vice-president and I will keep fighting for America\u2019s future \u2013 a future of promise and possibilities, of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things,\u201d he said. Despite relatively rosy economic figures, nearly three in five Americans wrongly believe the US is in recession, and the majority blame the Biden administration, according to a Harris poll conducted for the Guardian in May. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve scrambled to bring down inflation from its highest level in a generation, raising interest rates to a two-decade high. They are now considering when to start cutting rates, amid early signs that price growth is falling back towards the Fed\u2019s 2% target. \u201cThis is a perfect report for the Fed,\u201d Olu Sonola, head of economic research at Fitch Ratings, said of Thursday\u2019s GDP numbers. \u201cGrowth during the first half of the year is not too hot, inflation continues to cool and the elusive soft landing scenario looks within reach.\u201d Economists had expected GDP growth of about 2% in the second quarter.

            "content": "In season 2 of Sex and the City, Miranda \u2013 one of the main characters having sex in the city \u2013 gets asked out in an elevator. The man who asks her out is a recently divorced dad with an annoying son. Things end poorly. But the episode made Shanae, a 23-year-old Californian and part of the gen Z wave repopularizing the show, feel envious. \u201cI wished I lived in New York during that time,\u201d she told me later. Specifically, when people asked each other out in person. \u201cI guess people just didn\u2019t have social media, so if you saw someone you thought was attractive, you just had to say something,\u201d she says. Much of dating today starts on our phones. In the past decade, online dating has eclipsed other ways of meeting romantic partners. In the US, three in 10 adults have used a dating app, according to the Pew Research Center; in 2022, 45% of Americans who were single and dating used online dating platforms. In the UK, 11% of online adults visited an online dating service in May 2023, according to a report from Ofcom. And yet, like Shanae, many seem to be pining for the pre-dating app era. There have been countless articles, essays and teary viral posts about dating app fatigue. The complaints are legion: there are too many bots, swindlers and harassers; people don\u2019t look like their pictures, can\u2019t carry on a conversation, or ghost you. Users argue that popular profiles are effectively paywalled, and that the abstracting effect of a screen encourages bad behavior and unrealistic expectations \u2013 why waste time getting to know someone who is fine when someone perfect might be mere swipes away? So there\u2019s a growing appetite for alternative modes of dating. Speed dating is making a comeback. The apps themselves are offering opportunities for users to meet IRL. And then, there\u2019s the more extemporaneous way of meeting \u2013 seeing a person you think looks cool and asking them out. But after years of digital courtship, how do people really feel about asking out another human face-to-face? On dating advice forums, some users express discomfort at being asked out in person. Some fret that gen Z has forgotten how to flirt. Others worry about coming off creepy if they approach someone. Even Shanae, who yearns for the more direct, Sex and the City approach, says she would be \u201cweirded out\u201d if someone asked her out in person. \u201cI would probably say no because it\u2019s so uncommon,\u201d she says. The divide seems partly generational. In my informal survey process (texting people and bringing up this topic at parties), I found that millennials were more excited about meeting in person. Claire (a pseudonym) said she asked a guy out about a month ago and that it felt \u201cgreat\u201d. \u201cIt was a delight to go on a date and not be surprised by what somebody looks like or how it feels to physically be in their presence,\u201d she says. She added that she \u201cwill never go back to the apps, no matter how this shakes out\u201d. Christianna, 29, said she\u2019s met the last three people she\u2019s dated in person: one at a house party, another at a concert and another at a queer line dancing event. Several men in their 30s said they barely use the apps and primarily meet people in person. Gen Z, meanwhile, seems more ambivalent about the face-to-face approach, mostly because it\u2019s no longer the norm. Precious, 20, says she would like to be asked out, but agrees that it\u2019s just not common. \u201cI feel like a lot of people have lost the skill to talk to people IRL,\u201d she says. Precious also has concerns about personal safety. \u201cI see a lot of crazy shit on social media,\u201d she says. They also say approaching someone from behind a screen feels less daunting. For the most part, Shanae says, her peers find ways to talk online first: \u201cUsually, when people meet each other, they\u2019ll ask for their Instagram or number. I think Snapchat is a bit outdated now, but that used to be more popular.\u201d Precious says that she has asked out someone in person \u2013 but it was someone she already knew, and who had already expressed interest in her. That our phones have atrophied our social muscles to some degree is no great shock. But Dr Michael Rosenfeld, professor of sociology at Stanford University, says there is a much bigger issue at play. \u201cWe are in a dating recession,\u201d he says. According to Rosenfeld\u2019s data, there are roughly 60 million single adults in the US today, up from 47 million in 2017. Yet, he says, \u201call ways of dating are down\u201d. This includes online dating as well as meeting at bars and restaurants, or through friends or family. He attributes much of this romantic recession to the pandemic, which created new and scary barriers to dating, and stripped away the blitheness and excitement necessary to make dating fun. \u201cWhat could be more damaging to people\u2019s dating and relationship prospects than a fear that any kind of physical intimacy, even just talking to another person face-to-face, could kill you or your grandma?\u201d he says. Rosenfeld is skeptical that people are tired of dating apps specifically. \u201cIn my experience,\u201d he says, \u201csingle people looking for a partner are dissatisfied with all the ways of meeting until the day they find that person who put them into a relationship\u201d. He believes that many people are still recovering from having lost two or three years of dating experience, which has been especially hard on adolescents and young adults. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take them a few years to recover and build up that social experience,\u201d he says. \u201cThey need to be comfortable dating and experiencing.\u201d What is the way out of this dating recession, then? Is it asking people out in person? More apps? Matchmakers? Speed dating? Spells? \u201cI think we have to rely on the friskiness of young people to relight the fire and do what they\u2019re best at,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is to hang out and have fun.\u201d"

            "content": "The labor market started to ease in June, with 206,000 jobs added to the US economy last month, according to new labor data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The number of new jobs is close to what economists had expected for the month. The figures represent a slight cooling compared to May, when the economy added a revised 218,000 jobs. The unemployment rate in June was 4.1%, a 0.1% increase compared with May and the first time the rate has been above 4% in over two years. Data released earlier this week suggested the labor market was starting to cool. Payroll firm ADP reported that private employers added 150,000 jobs in June, down from 157,000 in May. Job losses also appear to be growing. Executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas reported 48,786 job cuts in June, down from 63,816 cuts in May but still a nearly 20% increase compared with June of last year. The jobs figures, released on the first Friday of every month, have been closely watched by Wall Street, which is eager to see interest rates drop, and in Washington, where the strength of hiring has been one of the few bright spots for the Biden administration, which is struggling with poor polling on its economic policies. Along with inflation figures, which come out later in the month, the Federal Reserve uses jobs figures to determine whether the economy is cooling and ready for interest rates to drop. Last month, officials at the Fed kept rates at a two-decade high of around 5.3%, where it has been for nearly a year. The Fed has been trying to bring inflation down to 2%. In May, inflation sat at 3.4% \u2013 lower than its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but still higher than the Fed\u2019s target rate. Minutes from the Fed\u2019s last meeting were released on Wednesday and showed the central bank was waiting for \u201cadditional favorable data\u201d before making cuts. But in bringing inflation down, the Fed must make sure the labor market is not cooling too much. Earlier this week, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said at an event that the economy has \u201cmade a lot of progress\u201d and has \u201cseen a pretty substantial move toward better balance\u201d in the labor market. \u201cWe want to be more confident that inflation is moving sustainably down. We want to understand that the levels that we\u2019re seeing are a true reading on what is actually happening with underlying inflation,\u201d Powell said. Inflation figures for June will be released on 11 July. The Fed\u2019s next meeting is on 30 and 31 July."

            "content": "Vladimir Putin is \u201cpeddling lies\u201d about the strength of the Russian economy that must be refuted, finance ministers from eight EU member states have said, with growing signs of deterioration in the face of biting sanctions. They say there are signs that the economy is being \u201csovietised\u201d with many hallmarks of the former USSR including expropriation of private assets to fund public spending, a \u201ctotal disregard to the social and economic wellbeing of the population\u201d and reorientation of the economy towards its war in Ukraine. \u201cIf Putin stays on this path, the long-term damage to the Russian economy will be significant,\u201d they wrote in a joint article in the Guardian. It was imperative, they said, that western democracies turned the screw amid fears that if there were a ceasefire in Ukraine tomorrow, Russia would spend the next few years regrouping its weakening economy for a second attack on Europe. \u201cBy re-Sovietising the Russian economy, Putin has put it on a path towards its own decline. Now it is time for the west to up the pressure even more. Supporting Ukraine and undermining Russia\u2019s capacity to wage war at every turn should be the top priority of every democratic country,\u201d they said. \u201cPresident Vladimir Putin and his authoritarian regime are peddling the false narrative that the Russian economy is strong, and that its war machine is unharmed by western sanctions. This is a lie that must be refuted. \u201cIn fact, there are many signs that the Russian war economy is deteriorating. The sanctions and other measures to weaken the Russian economy are effective, but even more can be done. We must continue to increase pressure against Putin\u2019s regime and support Ukraine.\u201d The article was written by the finance ministers of Sweden, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Netherlands and Poland, whose prime minister, Donald Tusk, has previously said Europe is in a \u201cpre-war era\u201d similar to 1938. The ministers urged counterparts across Europe and the US to ensure greater vigilance on circumvention of sanctions. But they are also calling on them to get behind a \u201cswift \u2026 operationalisation\u201d of a G7 June agreement to raise up to \u20ac50bn (\u00a342bn) in loans to Ukraine using windfall profits from Russia\u2019s immobilised assets. On Tuesday, the Kremlin said it would take legal action over what it called the \u201ctheft\u201d of its cash reserves, which were frozen after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The ministers also want sanctions on energy, finance and technology products getting into Russia to be strengthened to close down circumvention routes. Both \u201cborder and source countries\u201d of technology including many in the EU and the US needed to \u201ccontinue working on closing the loopholes\u201d. This week, the UK pledged to help crack down on \u201cphantom fleets\u201d of tankers that are sneaking oil out of Russia and selling it for more than the $60 energy sanctions price cap and further fuelling Russia\u2019s war machine."

            "date": "2024-07-16T23:01:06Z",
            "content": "Local councils will have to adopt mandatory housing targets within months under planning reforms to be unveiled on Wednesday as part of Keir Starmer\u2019s first king\u2019s speech, which the prime minister says will be focused on economic growth. Starmer will introduce a package of more than 35 bills on Wednesday, the first Labour prime minister to do so in 15 years, as he looks to put the economy at the centre of his first year in office. Labour will use the next 12 months to introduce laws on planning reform, devolution and public transport, the prime minister will tell parliament. But with ministers prioritising growth above all other political ambitions, the government will not legislate to reduce the voting age or penalise employers for not training and recruiting British workers. Starmer said before the speech: \u201cNow is the time to take the brakes off Britain. For too long people have been held back, their paths determined by where they came from \u2013 not their talents and hard work. \u201cI am determined to create wealth for people up and down the country. It is the only way our country can progress, and my government is focused on supporting that aspiration. \u201cToday\u2019s new laws will take back control and lay the foundations of real change that this country is crying out for, creating wealth in every community and making people better off \u2013 supporting their ambitions, hopes and dreams.\u201d Starmer will introduce his first king\u2019s speech on Wednesday by unveiling a wide array of measures mostly focused on the economy. At its core will be planning change, with Starmer having pledged that his party would be \u201cbuilders, not blockers\u201d. In its first week in office, Labour overturned the previous government\u2019s de facto ban on onshore windfarms in an effort to boost the construction of clean energy generation. The prime minister will announce the next stage of the party\u2019s plans to liberalise the planning system on Wednesday with a bill designed to reimpose mandatory housing targets on local authorities. Michael Gove, the former housing secretary, relaxed those targets last year amid pressure from Tory backbenchers, allowing councils to ignore them if they were deemed to undermine the character of an area. The government also wants local authorities to work together to identify regional infrastructure needs in an attempt to stop individual authorities blocking plans. Officials have told the Guardian they will begin a consultation on the new targets in the next two weeks, with a view to having them in place by the autumn. Angela Rayner, the housing and local government secretary, will oversee the planning proposals as well as a separate bill on English devolution. Local authorities will be required not only to create local housing plans, but also a local growth plan detailing how they intend to support industry and the wider economy in their areas. Louise Haigh, the transport secretary, will steer bills to renationalise the railways and to allow greater public sector involvement in running local bus networks. Under the railways bill, rail services will return to public ownership once contracts with private-sector controllers expire. The bill will create an arms-length body called Great British Railways to monitor passenger satisfaction with new systems and to introduce changes such as automatic compensation across the whole network. The buses bill will give local leaders greater powers to launch publicly owned bus services. Not all the bills in the package are expected to be economically focused. Starmer is expected to announce a House of Lords reform bill which could set the mandatory retirement age for the upper chamber at 80. He is also set to resurrect the plan of his predecessor, Rishi Sunak, to bring in a phased smoking ban, which was dropped in the last-minute flurry of legislation passed after the election was called. Other long-held Labour policies have not made the cut, including the party\u2019s promise to bring the voting age down to 16. Government insiders said they remained committed to the proposal but that bills to help drive economic growth were the priority this time round. One source suggested that voting age changes could wait until closer to the next election, prompting speculation that the plan may never happen at all."

            "date": "2024-07-26T11:00:49Z",
            "content": "A greener economy could bring millions of jobs to some of the largest countries in Africa, according to a new report. Research by the development agency FSD Africa and the impact advisory firm Shortlist predicts that 3.3 million jobs could be generated across the continent by 2030. Forecasting Green Jobs in Africa predicts that 60% of the roles, mainly in the renewable energy sector, will be skilled or white collar positions that can \u201cspur the growth of the middle class in countries with high-growth sectors\u201d such as renewable energy, e-mobility, construction and manufacturing. The report was based on forecasts from five countries \u2013 the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa \u2013 that the study says will see more than a fifth of the jobs expected from the green transition over the next six years. About 10% of the jobs created will demand university degrees, 30% will be \u201cspecialised\u201d work that requires certification or vocational training, and 20% administrative. Unskilled labour will be more stable, with opportunities for upward mobility, the study predicts. \u201cThis is the first public report that takes seriously the notion that human capital and talent is important as an input to green economic growth, and as a positive outcome \u2013 in the form of millions of new, direct jobs,\u201d says Paul Breloff, CEO of Shortlist. The renewable energy sector will generate about 70% of jobs, and roughly 1.7m will be in solar power. DRC and Ethiopia, with Africa\u2019s largest and second largest hydropower potential \u2013 will see jobs in that sector. Agriculture should employ hundreds of thousands, with more than half of those jobs in climate-smart technology. The researchers call on policymakers, funders and educational institutions to invest in training a workforce in green industries, saying it could \u201ccontribute to the formalisation of African economies, and the inclusion of whole populations in stable systems of remuneration, social security and taxation\u201d. \u201cPolicymakers and funders and workforce developers need to step up to meet this near-term demand with effective training, apprenticeships, and job/skill matching, in hopes of achieving Africa\u2019s green promise,\u201d said Breloff. With its young workforce and vast renewable energy resources, Africa can \u201cleapfrog\u201d into renewables, skipping over the carbon-intensive pathways taken by industrialised countries, but, the report\u2019s authors argue, it will require \u201csupportive policies, infrastructure, and significant financial investments, estimated at over $100bn annually\u201d. African countries have struggled to attract renewable energy investments due to investor perceptions of risk and concerns over commercial viability. The continent receives only 3% of global clean energy funding. To meet climate and energy access development goals, investments need to more than double to over \u00a3155bn a year by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the African Development Bank. \u201cYou need a base level of good skills in the country to get investors comfortable putting their money into green investments \u2013 those jobs de-risk investments, investments flow into or within the country. If finance flows, then projects get to be realised, and will create even more new jobs,\u201d said Kevin Munjal, director of development impact at FSD Africa. Some countries, especially those with oil and gas reserves, continue to push back on calls for Africa, which accounts for less than 4% of global carbon emissions, to elevate carbon reduction goals over domestic priorities, such as fossil fuels for economic growth or domestic energy, when 600 million Africans do not have access to electricity. Munjal says that, while \u201cthere is need to think about a just transition\u201d, green growth provides critical potential for jobs and economic growth. \u201cThere is a significant opportunity here to address what is quickly turning into a demographic crisis,\u201d said Munjal. \u201cAfrica has the youngest, fastest-growing workforce but \u2026 the youth need jobs.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-21T10:09:11Z",
            "content": "I\u2019m due a haircut and in the past week received a message from my barber containing the news that the price will be 10% higher than the last time I went for a trim. If I call in for a coffee on my way to work it will be a similar story. After recent price rises, I can expect to pay the thick end of \u00a34 for a flat white. These are two examples of what Rachel Reeves calls the everyday economy in action, and they tell us something about the challenge facing the chancellor as she seeks to improve the UK\u2019s poor economic performance. It\u2019s not hard to see why a haircut and a cup of coffee are going up in price. Rents are higher, insurance is more expensive and so are fuel and labour. Businesses have a choice: they can either absorb these extra costs themselves or they can try to pass them on to their customers. Many are doing the latter, which is why inflation in the services sector is running at 5.7% while overall inflation is at 2%. This matters. These days, the UK is primarily a service-sector economy. Manufacturing and construction are still important, but services account for about 80% of national output. Prices have risen by about 20% in the past three years and labour shortages have made it harder for employers to resist pressure for higher pay to compensate. Much of the service sector is labour-intensive and, unsurprisingly, workers don\u2019t want to see their living standards eroded. The very nature of the service sector makes productivity improvements hard to chisel out. My haircut takes as long as it did a year ago; the flat white comes in the same-sized cup and tastes the same. As a customer, I am getting the same service but paying more for it. As a nation, output per worker is up by 1.5% in the four years since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic; in the public sector \u2013 where Reeves is contemplating above-inflation pay awards this year \u2013 productivity is 6% lower. Productivity is easy to measure in a car factory but harder to assess in the NHS. If a GP spends five minutes more per patient but by doing so saves lives does that count as productivity loss, because of the extra time spent, or (as it should) a productivity gain? Similarly, a restaurant meal might take as long to produce as it did a year ago but be of a higher quality. If this means the customers have a better time than they did before then that\u2019s a productivity improvement in any meaningful sense of the term. But time-wise, it\u2019s no better. Nor is it impossible to think of ways in which technology has helped to boost service-sector productivity. Checking a fact or referring to a previously written article meant a visit to the cuttings\u2019 library when I started as a journalist many moons ago. Now search engines make the process quicker and simpler. Even so, the fact that the UK is a labour-intensive service-sector economy has made the Bank of England warier about cutting interest rates than it might otherwise have been. A blog on Threadneedle Street\u2019s Bank Underground site by a staff member, Tomas Key, found that trend (underlying) wage growth is currently 6%, double its pre-pandemic level. This raises two questions. The first is whether higher wage growth is merely a response to higher inflation and will come down now that prices are rising less quickly. That appears to be the case. The annual growth in average earnings was 5.1% in the year to May compared with 8.2% in the same month of 2023. The second is whether the Bank can do much to bring down wage growth, short of keeping interest rates at a punitive enough level to cause economic distress. The answer is no, not really. Higher interest rates are a crude tool that work by making businesses too nervous to risk raising prices and by forcing workers to accept below-inflation pay increases through the fear of losing their jobs. So far, the evidence is that the economy has withstood a year of interest rates at 5.25% much better than might have been expected. There was a short, shallow, technical recession in the second half of 2023 but activity is now gently recovering. It would be doing so more quickly were it not for the 14 increases in official borrowing costs between December 2021 and August 2023. All that said, the answer to Britain\u2019s productivity weakness does not lie with the Bank of England. Instead, it will depend on changes to the supply side of the economy. Reeves will chair the first meeting of the Treasury\u2019s new growth mission board on Tuesday. Higher levels of private and public investment would help boost productivity and growth. If manufacturing represented a bigger share of national output that would help too because there is more scope for labour-saving efficiencies in a factory than in a care home. Productivity growth would be faster were Britain\u2019s industrial base bigger. AI has the potential to be an a gamechanger, because it will have an impact on all sectors of the economy and not just manufacturing. Indeed, there is already evidence of that happening. Labour is unsure how to regulate AI but if it wants faster productivity growth then AI is going to be an important part of the mix. Even then, though, it is important to be realistic. Britain is going to remain predominantly a service-sector economy and there are services that do not readily lend themselves to productivity gains. A robot cutting my hair? I don\u2019t think so."

From the Conservative claim that Labour would increase taxes by \u00a32,000 to Labour\u2019s own speculative estimates that Tory policies would lead to \u00a34,800 mortgage increases, dodgy statistics have stained recent votes, demeaned our political dialogue and degraded public trust. The \u00a3350m claim on the side of a bus was simply part of a trend. Campaigns which come down to duelling unsound statistics serve neither the voters nor the country. While they might persuade some, for many more they exacerbate the corrosive belief that politicians distort the facts to serve themselves.

            "content": "Coordinated networks of accounts spreading disinformation \u201cflooded\u201d social media in France, Germany and Italy before the elections to the European parliament, Dutch researchers have found. After an in-depth analysis of disinformation on the platform X in four EU countries, the researchers concluded that many of the accounts had been set up after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine but were cranked up in the weeks and days before the vote, with growth in their numbers of followers rocketing. \u201cThe impact of these accounts is increasing at an alarming rate,\u201d said Trollrensics, a specialist consultancy commissioned by the Dutch Socialist and Democratic parties in the European parliament. \u201cWe can conclude with absolute certainty that a large coordinated network of accounts was influencing the EU elections in Germany, France and Italy.\u201d Using specialist software, the consultancy studied 2.3m posts from 468,000 accounts in Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands. From that dataset, it identified 50,000 as accounts that spread disinformation. In France, it found that of the more than 127,000 posts in its dataset mentioning \u00c9ric Zemmour, the founder of the far-right political party Reconqu\u00eate, 20% had come from disinformation accounts. In Germany, 10% of posts about Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland in their dataset came from the disinformation accounts. The \u201cactual percentage\u201d was likely to be higher in both countries, the consultancy said. It found no organised disinformation networks in the Netherlands and the accounts it studied in Italy were less concerned with the EU elections and more with controversies over migration or vaccination. Trollrensics said the scale of disinformation networks meant they could and did \u201ctake over an entire debate by just flooding X with posts, reposts, comments and likes\u201d. Accounts were shown to be \u201cdensely connected\u201d and probably run by humans rather than AI, said the Trollrensics co-founder Richard Odekerken. One X account used in Germany named 888_leila and belonging to a Leila Ruth 888 also posted in Russian. Analysis showed there were 13 different accounts belonging to a Leila Ruth 888 from user-stated locations around the world including Brazil, Ohio, Finland and Uganda. Trollrensics specialises in analysing disinformation networks that typically include troll accounts attempting to interfere in a concerted manner to influence public discourse. The report, titled EU Elections Investigation, said: \u201cThe scale of the operation suggests that it [the disinformation network] necessitates significant human resources and time.\u201d Many were created after 1 January this year and amassed a large number of followers very quickly. Nearly all the accounts followed by the researchers followed back \u2013 another red flag for coordinated activity. \u201cThe technique is primarily used to give the account credibility as it appears more legitimate if it has a large number of followers,\u201d the report said. The Dutch S&amp;D MEP Thijs Reuten who commissioned the report, said it was difficult to establish a causal link between the accounts and the EU elections results, but he had learned through the research that \u201cthe first objective was to show doubt\u201d and discredit the authorities in the west, part of a narrative known to be pushed by Russia. Robert van der Noordaa, another co-founder of Trollrensics, said: \u201cIf you are surrounded on whatever social media platform by accounts from the same country, posting in the same language and they are all saying \u2018vote for this guy\u2019, that probably works far better than Coca-Cola saying \u2018drink Coca-Cola\u2019.\u201d"

            "content": "Even before Venezuelans went to the polls on Sunday, it was entirely predictable that Nicol\u00e1s Maduro would declare victory and that the opposition would call the election a sham, as before. So it came to pass. With most of the vote counted, the government-controlled electoral authority said that the incumbent president had taken 51% of votes while his rival, the former diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, had won 44%. The opposition say that they have voting tallies proving otherwise, and that Mr Gonz\u00e1lez is president-elect: \u201cThe Venezuelans and the entire world know what happened,\u201d he said. Two things have changed. The first is that there has been a widespread rejection of Mr Maduro\u2019s disastrous reign, even in impoverished areas that were previously strongholds of the Chavismo movement he inherited. Their residents have had enough of the economic and humanitarian catastrophe that has left an estimated 19 million people without adequate healthcare and nutrition, and no longer buy his explanation that it\u2019s all the fault of others. US sanctions have exacerbated the crisis, but his government is corrupt and incompetent as well as brutal. Mr Maduro may blame the extreme right for the protests and clashes now seen on the streets, but he knows that he\u2019s lost supporters on whom he once counted. The second striking shift is that while Russia, Cuba, China and other old friends were quick to congratulate Mr Maduro, several leftist governments in the region have struck a different note. Though Brazil has been cautious in public remarks, it is reportedly negotiating a joint statement with Mexico and Colombia, demanding detailed voting records from each area. The gulf between polls during the race and the declared result is too implausibly vast to ignore. Many voters appeared motivated less by an enthusiastic embrace of the opposition than an uncompromising rejection of Mr Maduro. The driving force in the opposition bloc, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado \u2013 who backed Mr Gonz\u00e1lez after she was banned from running \u2013 calls herself a centrist liberal, but is a conservative who has backed privatisation of state-owned companies, promised to \u201cbury socialism forever\u201d and supported foreign intervention to overthrow Mr Maduro. She called the landslide that she claims her side won \u201cirreversible\u201d. Yet mass protests and international sympathy were not enough to bring the opposition to victory in the past. Juan Guaid\u00f3 declared himself president in 2019, and was swiftly recognised by the US and around 50 other countries \u2013 but failed to unseat Mr Maduro, despite the efforts of the Trump administration. Many in Latin America have good reason to be cautious about foreign intervention. Almost 8 million Venezuelans have voted with their feet since Mr Maduro was narrowly elected in 2013, and one poll suggested that as many as a third of Venezuelans might consider leaving if he remained in power. That is worrying others in the region and the US, facing its own election. But it is the interests and rights of Venezuelans that must be the priority. Mr Maduro warned of \u201ca bloodbath \u2026 a fratricidal civil war\u201d if his party did not triumph. For now at least, he appears to have locked in the support of security forces. His human rights record is grim. The fear is that he will double down on his authoritarian repression. More sympathetic nations, as well as the old foes he despises, should do their utmost to ensure he respects the people."

Over the weekend, voters in the French Pacific territory cast their ballots for their representatives in two seats in France\u2019s national parliament. Emmanuel Tjibaou won out over a loyalist candidate in the second round of voting, while rightwing candidate and French loyalist Nicolas Metzdorf won New Caledonia\u2019s second parliamentary seat. Tjibaou becomes the first pro-independence candidate to win a seat in the national assembly since 1986. A political novice, he is the son of a well-known Kanak independence leader, Jean-Marie Tjibaou, who was assassinated in 1989. His win is viewed as setback for the pro-France movement in the territory. The election comes weeks after deadly violence first flared in the capital, Noum\u00e9a, over plans from Paris over voting changes. In May, riots began after lawmakers in Paris approved a constitutional amendment to allow recent arrivals to the territory to vote in provincial elections, a decision \u2013 since put on ice by president Emmanuel Macron \u2013 that the Kanak population feared would further dilute their influence. Kanaks make up about 40% of New Caledonia\u2019s population. Tensions eased in recent weeks but the territory has continued to see bouts of unrest. Nine people \u2013 including two police officers \u2013 have been killed in the violence which caused widespread damage to businesses, shops and homes. Tjibaou said he felt a sense of responsibility in the face of New Caledonia\u2019s current situation, which has been the scene of violence and riots for multiple weeks, according to RNZ. On Sunday, Tjibaou told public broadcaster NC la 1\u00e8re he deplored the \u201cdramatic situation\u201d and that there was now a need to urgently \u201crestore the conditions\u201d for a dialogue to resume between pro-independence and pro-France parties, RNZ reported. Tjibaou said the elections were \u201ca proof that democracy is alive\u201d in New Caledonia, and that this should be the only way for people to express themselves, RNZ reported.

            "date": "2024-07-09T17:56:39Z",
            "content": "The Republican former senator James Inhofe, a climate denier who once brought a snowball to the chamber floor in a stunt attempting to disprove global warming, died on Tuesday at the age of 89. Inhofe resigned as senator for Oklahoma in January 2023, suffering long-term effects of Covid-19. Elected in 1994, his time as the state\u2019s longest-serving senator was notable for his ultra-conservative positions on numerous issues, including calling the climate emergency \u201cthe greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people\u201d. His death was announced on Tuesday in a family statement, which stated the cause was a stroke. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, a Republican ally during Inhofe\u2019s chairing of the Senate\u2019s armed forces and environment committees, was among the first to pay tribute. \u201cThe people he served, a group much larger than the proud residents of the Sooner state, were better for it,\u201d a statement from McConnell\u2019s office said. \u201cJim\u2019s diligent stewardship of massive infrastructure projects transformed life across the heartland. His relentless advocacy for American energy dominance unlocked new prosperity across the country. And his laser focus on growing and modernizing the US military strengthened the security of the entire free world.\u201d As perhaps the most vocal Senate Republican climate denier, he called the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a \u201cGestapo bureaucracy\u201d, opposed efforts by Democrats to cap greenhouse gas emissions, and pursued lucrative tax incentives for domestic oil and gas producers. His widely ridiculed snowball stunt came in 2015, during a rambling speech in which he claimed climate conditions on Earth were the work of a supreme being, and attempted to discredit a Nasa report that found that 2014 was the hottest year recorded globally to date. \u201cMy point is, God\u2019s still up there,\u201d Inhofe said during a 2012 interview during promotion for his book focusing on global warming as \u201ca conspiracy\u201d. \u201cThe arrogance of people to think that we, human beings, would be able to change what He is doing in the climate is, to me, outrageous.\u201d According to Open Secrets, between 1989 and 2022, Inhofe received campaign donations worth almost $4m from energy producers. As chair of the Senate armed services committee, Inhofe was an advocate for a large US military presence on the world stage, and supported sizable defense spending budgets to pay for it. Following the scandal over US service members photographed abusing prisoners at Iraq\u2019s Abu Ghraib prison in 2004, Inhofe said he \u201cwas more outraged at the outrage\u201d than the torture of the inmates. Inhofe was born on 17 November 1934 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a city he served as mayor from 1978 to 1984. He was elected to the state house in 1966, aged 31, and state senate three years later. His career in Washington DC began in 1986 as a US congressman for Oklahoma\u2019s first district, and he won re-election three times before stepping up to the Senate in 1994 when Republican incumbent David Boren became president of the University of Oklahoma. A keen aviator, Inhofe married his wife, Kay, in 1959, and they had four children. A son, Perry, died in a solo airplane crash in 2013. Reuters contributed reporting"

            "date": "2024-07-31T15:00:22Z",
            "content": "Most gardeners love nothing more than the chance to chat about what has worked and what hasn\u2019t in their flowerbeds this year. So the latest callout from the Royal Horticultural Society will be music to their ears; the RHS is asking for information about what flowered for ages, what loved being waterlogged and how plants did on the occasional hot day, so that they can draw up a plan for how to keep gardening alive during the climate crisis. Heatwaves and a drought in 2022 and the wettest ever 18 months between 2023 and 2024 have meant that gardens are either roasting or turning into bogs. Plants that have been a taken-for-granted fixture in flowerbeds for centuries may have to be swapped for new species, or made more resilient to the climate crisis. The RHS has already noticed that Gladiolus and Iris are thriving in the warmer summers, but others, including Hebe and Pittosporum, are being negatively affected by the increasing amount of heavy rainfall, extreme temperatures and unpredictable frosts. Working with the Universities of Sheffield and Reading, the charity is trying to understand what is growing well or struggling, how different gardeners are coping with the climate crisis and which maintenance habits are working and which are not. The research will also build up a picture of which plants are thriving in different parts of the UK, and which are not. The research will help to inform recommendations for how to manage and protect plant diversity across the country. Information will also be used to identify which plants might thrive in the UK in the future. The RHS is already swapping out some plants for others in its own gardens. Heat-loving banana and lotus have flowered at RHS Garden Harlow Carr in Yorkshire, which was not thought to be possible a decade ago. Lagerstroemia, originating from south-east Asia, has been trialled successfully at RHS Garden Wisley in Surrey, which also would not have been likely before the UK\u2019s climate began to change. RHS Garden Hyde Hall near Chelmsford in Essex has managed to grow cacti due to the warming conditions. The plants have overwintered without any protection and have withstood the very wet spring. Hyde Hall are also now able to grow euphorbia mellifera outside in their Australia garden, which normally overwinters indoors in their historic glasshouse. Gardeners are having to duplicate and move some plants from Wisley, which is in one of the drier, hotter parts of the country. Heather and Hepatica plants from the national collections also based at Wisley are being grown at other sites because of vulnerability to drought and the potential for loss. Tim Upson, RHS\u2019s director of gardens and horticulture, said: \u201cIn a garden, plant diversity is everything and our extensive collections provide some insight into what grows well from year to year and from place to place. Tapping into the observations of the UK\u2019s 30 million gardeners, many of whom will have noticed longer-lasting blooms or waterlogged perennials, will help us in better understanding how our gardens need to evolve to ensure they continue to provide the environmental and health and wellbeing benefits we currently enjoy, 10, 20 and 30 years from now.\u201d Gardeners can contribute to the survey, which runs until 15 October, here. \u2022 The picture on this article was changed on 1 August 2024 because an earlier image showed a succulent rather than a cactus."

            "date": "2024-07-08T02:00:23Z",
            "content": "The world has baked for 12 consecutive months in temperatures 1.5C (2.7F) greater than their average before the fossil fuel era, new data shows. Temperatures between July 2023 and June 2024 were the highest on record, scientists found, creating a year-long stretch in which the Earth was 1.64C hotter than in preindustrial times. The findings do not mean world leaders have already failed to honour their promises to stop the planet heating 1.5C by the end of the century \u2013 a target that is measured in decadal averages rather than single years \u2013 but that scorching heat will have exposed more people to violent weather. A sustained rise in temperatures above this level also increases the risk of uncertain but catastrophic tipping points. Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which analysed the data, said the results were not a statistical oddity but a \u201clarge and continuing shift\u201d in the climate. \u201cEven if this specific streak of extremes ends at some point, we are bound to see new records being broken as the climate continues to warm,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is inevitable unless we stop adding greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and the oceans.\u201d Copernicus, a scientific organisation that belongs to the EU\u2019s space programme, uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations to track key climate metrics. It found June 2024 was hotter than any other June on record and was the 12th month in a row with temperatures 1.5C greater than their average between 1850 and 1900. Because temperatures in some months had \u201crelatively small margins\u201d above 1.5C, the scientists said, datasets from other climate agencies may not confirm the 12-month temperature streak. Whether pumped out the chimney of a coal-burning power plant or ejected from the exhaust pipe of a passenger plane, each carbon molecule clogging the Earth\u2019s atmosphere traps heat and warps weather. The hotter the planet gets, the less people and ecosystems can adapt. \u201cThis is not good news at all,\u201d said Aditi Mukherji, a director at research institute CGIAR and co-author of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. \u201cWe know that extreme events increase with every increment of global warming \u2013 and at 1.5C, we witnessed some of the hottest extremes this year.\u201d Some ecosystems are more vulnerable than others. In its latest review of the science, the IPCC found that 1.5C of warming will kill off 70-90% of tropical coral reefs, while warming of 2C will wipe them out almost entirely. A Guardian survey of hundreds of IPCC authors this year found three-quarters expect the planet to heat by at least 2.5C by 2100, with about half of the scientists expecting temperatures above 3C. The increments sound small but can mean the difference between widespread human suffering and \u201csemi-dystopian\u201d futures. Mukherji compared 1C of global heating to a mild fever and 1.5C a medium-to-high grade fever. \u201cNow imagine a human body with [that] temperature for years. Will that person function normally any more?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s currently our Earth system,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is a crisis.\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Gemenne, an IPCC author and director of the Hugo Observatory at the University of Li\u00e8ge, said the climate crisis is not a binary issue. \u201cIt is not 1.5C or death \u2013 every 0.1C matters a great deal because we\u2019re talking about global average temperatures, which translate into massive temperature gaps locally.\u201d Even in a best-case scenario, he said, people need to prepare for a warmer world and \u201cbeef up\u201d response plans. \u201cAdaptation is not an admission that our current efforts are useless.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-09T13:00:29Z",
            "content": "Mark Hertsgaard and Kyle Pope of Covering Climate Now (CCNow) hail the winners of their organization\u2019s annual global climate journalism awards, and here describe some lessons they have taken from the more than 1,250 entries. If you live in France, you can watch global warming happening live on the evening news \u2013 and it\u2019s a hit with viewers The woman behind this landmark innovation is Audrey Cerdan of France Televisions, France\u2019s public broadcaster. As announced on Tuesday, Cerdan is one of three winners of a 2024 journalist of the year award by our organization, Covering Climate Now, which for the past five years has been helping hundreds of newsrooms worldwide cover the climate crisis. At a time when extreme heat is leaving hundreds dead from Mexico to India, when a category 5 hurricane is \u201cflattening\u201d entire islands in the Caribbean, and when US supreme court rulings are granting corporate polluters and their political patrons unprecedented legal protections, Cerdan and 50 additional Covering Climate Now Journalism Award winners are a stirring antidote to climate despair. Their work demonstrates that telling the climate story well helps the public understand not only that the world is on fire, but also how to put the fire out. In March 2023, France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions stopped including a traditional weather report in its 8pm newscast and replaced it with a weather-climate report: in French, a Journal M\u00e9t\u00e9o-Climat. Viewers of the new weather-climate report still saw maps dotted with numbers depicting the day\u2019s high and low temperatures in Paris, Marseilles and other cities in France. The on-camera presenter, Ana\u00efs Baydemir, still told them whether it would rain or shine tomorrow. But now, that basic weather news was communicated in the context of climate change. From the opening seconds of the report, stretching across the bottom of the screen was a row of blue-and-white digits. The digits depicted, to an exactitude of eight decimal points, how much hotter France was now compared to a century ago, before humans\u2019 burning of large amounts of coal, oil and gas began trapping excessive heat in the atmosphere. The night Journal M\u00e9t\u00e9o-Climat premiered, on 13 March 2023, the dashboard registered 1.18749861C above the pre-industrial level. After 37 seconds, the dashboard\u2019s last digit clicked up a notch to 1.18749862C; then, after two minutes and 28 seconds, another notch to 1.18749873C. That was global warming, happening and presented in real time \u2013 an explicit rebuttal of the lie that climate change is somehow a hoax. Within weeks, France Televisions\u2019 ratings for that part of its evening news began climbing, according to the network. Cerdan, who spearheaded the innovation, credits the ratings boost partly to the fact that most of the show\u2019s segments included a viewer\u2019s question about climate change, answered by a scientist. (For example: will France still have four seasons under climate change? Yes, but they will be hotter.) In short, if journalists tell the climate story in a creative way that genuinely helps people make sense of the world around them, people will watch or read that news. Members of frontline communities often tell the climate story best For this year\u2019s awards, CCNow\u2019s judges evaluated more than 1,250 entries from every corner of the globe. The reporting in the places most affected by the climate crisis stood out for its urgency, its compassion, and its commitment to telling personal stories. For example, a second CCNow journalist of the year winner is Tristan Ahtone, a member of the Kiowa Tribe who wrote a blistering expose for Grist about US universities profiting from oil and gas production on stolen Indigenous lands. A third \u201cJournalist of the Year\u201d is Rachel Ramirez, a climate reporter for CNN, whose upbringing in the Northern Marianas Islands informs her reporting on climate change\u2019s disproportionate impact on women and girls and other issues of climate justice. Climate crisis is a crime story The planet didn\u2019t overheat itself. Some of the best climate reporting highlights who the bad guys are, what they\u2019re trying to get away with, and how they can be held accountable. The UK-based Centre for Climate Reporting, in collaboration with the BBC, revealed how Sultan Al Jaber \u2013 the CEO of the United Arab Emirates\u2019 state-run oil company and president of the COP28 UN climate summit \u2013 used the latter role to lobby for oil and gas. Agence France-Presse reported that the global consultant firm McKinsey &amp; Company, which publicly supports climate action, nevertheless used Cop28 to promote its clients\u2019 plans to continue oil and gas production for years to come. There is incredible bravery in some of the best climate reporting Sometimes that bravery means angering sources who then no longer talk to you, or stirring up the trolls on social media. Other times, bravery takes a much more serious form. In June 2022, the British journalist Dom Phillips and Indigenous activist Bruno Pereira were killed in the Vale do Javari, the second-largest indigenous area in Brazil, apparently in retaliation for their journalism exposing the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. In 2023, 16 news outlets around the world, led by the Paris-based network Forbidden Stories, joined together to continue Phillips\u2019s and Pereira\u2019s work. Forbidden Stories\u2019 investigations revealed how illegal industry and organized crime continue to stymie protection of the Amazon, whose health is vital to its Indigenous inhabitants and the world\u2019s climate future. There is good news on the climate beat Solar, wind, storage batteries and other pillars of the green economy are growing by leaps and bounds, as mainstream business media have reported. But less publicized are solutions emerging from the grassroots, including in some of the most climate-vulnerable locations on earth. IndiaSpend, a digital outlet in India, won its award by profiling a frontline community\u2019s ingenious efforts to cope with drought, illustrating how local knowledge and involvement can be key to successful climate change adaptation. Covering Climate Now has long maintained that better news coverage is itself an essential climate solution. Without it, there simply won\u2019t be the mass awareness and public pressure to drive governments, business, and society as a whole to make the rapid, far-reaching changes required to preserve a liveable planet. The 51 winners of 2024 Covering Climate Now Journalism awards are certainly doing their part. We hope their example inspires fellow journalists everywhere to do the same. Mark Hertsgaard is executive director and co-founder of Covering Climate Now, a global journalism collaboration committed to more and better coverage of the climate story, and the Nation magazine\u2019s environment correspondent Kyle Pope is executive director of strategic initiatives and co-founder of Covering Climate Now, and a former editor and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review"

            "content": "Renewable energy investment experts have revealed growing worries the Coalition\u2019s plans to build nuclear reactors in Australia is breeding uncertainty and is already delaying decisions to back major solar and wind projects. The Coalition\u2019s push to build taxpayer-funded nuclear reactors at seven locations while refusing to back improved climate targets could see investors shifting huge sums of cash to other economies where the clean energy transition has bipartisan support. The policy uncertainty is unlikely to be resolved until the result of the next general election is known, which could be as late as May 2025. \u201cSome of Australia\u2019s biggest investors are putting on hold new clean energy investments in this country because of the lack of bipartisan support for the least-cost pathway to net zero emissions,\u201d said Erwin Jackson, the policy director at the Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC). The Coalition\u2019s plans include having so-called small modular reactors (SMRs) operating at sites in South Australia and Western Australia by 2035. On Wednesday, the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE) released a report saying SMRs were unlikely to be available commercially until the late 2030s and a mature market might emerge \u201cduring the mid- to late-2040s\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Since the Coalition\u2019s plans were made public, Jackson said \u201cmore than one\u201d major investor had said they would be holding off on making an investment decision. He said: \u201cInvestors have a duty to deliver the best long-term savings and they\u2019ve assessed the best way to deliver that is investing in a well-planned and fair transition to net zero. If that\u2019s not going to be delivered in Australia they will invest in other jurisdictions with clear, stable, long-term policy.\u201d IGCC periodically asks its members to describe issues that are barriers to investing. Jackson said surveys, carried out before the Coalition confirmed its nuclear hopes, had shown that concerns over \u201cpolicy uncertainty\u201d had fallen in the last two years. Jackson said: \u201cThe real risk is that we return to a situation where the lack of bipartisanship will see investments flow offshore, and Australia misses out on the jobs, training and opportunities from renewable energy.\u201d Marilyn Crestias is the interim chief executive at the Clean Energy Investor Group, whose members have investments in half of all clean energy assets in the country\u2019s east. In recent months, she said the group had seen \u201can increase in concern and commentary [from members] around the potential for policy uncertainty and the negative impacts that would have on investments in Australia\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s important because we see other countries, such as the United States, and in Europe and Asia, being really ambitious and accelerating that ambition,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for Australia to remain competitive to attract that global capital. \u201cWe need to think about the long-term signals [for investors]. They are putting in large amounts of capital on long-lived assets and they need to see those signals over the medium to long term and have certainty around the environment these assets will operate in.\u201d Crestias said steps taken by states and the Albanese government, such as raising climate targets and opening investment schemes for renewables, had created a more favourable environment to invest. \u201cThe right building blocks are being put in place,\u201d she said. \u201cI would urge governments to continue setting ambitious targets.\u201d The ATSE report on SMRs, compiled by academy fellows, said the technology was still in its infancy and no commercial projects existed in the OECD, but it was \u201cpossible that several prototype SMRs may be licensed, commissioned and built in OECD countries by the mid-2030s\u201d. The report said the lowest risk and cheapest option for Australia would be to wait until a mature market exists for SMRs, which would likely be in the mid- to late-2040s."

The Central General Staff (EMC), a guerrilla faction that rejected the country\u2019s 2016 peace agreement, said on Wednesday it would order its militants not to target the Cop16 negotiations that are due to begin in Cali in October. Earlier in July, the EMC released statements online saying the summit \u201cwould fail\u201d, prompting concerns that rebels would attack the conference. The group\u2019s leader, Nestor Gregorio, better known by the nom de guerre Iv\u00e1n Mordisco, said in a video message on X: \u201cWe\u2019ve decided, as a gesture of our will for peace, to order our units not to affect the normal development of the Cop16 that will be held soon in the city of Cali.\u201d On 16 July, the Colombian defence ministry ended a ceasefire with parts of the EMC led by Mordisco, because of rising violence. A series of bombings and shootings in and around Cali have been blamed on the group. About 12,000 soldiers and police are expected to be deployed a month before the summit to ensure the safety of delegates and ministers from around the world. The Colombian government did not comment on the EMC\u2019s announcement. In response to the initial threat of disruption, authorities had issued a statement reassuring prospective attendees. \u201cThe safety and wellbeing of all participants, attendees and collaborators are our top priority. All security guarantees are in places to have a successful and smooth conference. We convey to all participants, delegates, media and stakeholders a message of reassurance,\u201d the statement read. The Colombian government announced late last year that it would host the Cop16 summit, after Turkey dropped out, citing the earthquakes that had devastated parts of the country. Under Gustavo Petro\u2019s presidency, Colombia has positioned itself as an international leader on environmental issues, becoming the first major oil, gas and coal producer to join an alliance calling for a fossil fuel nonproliferation treaty at Cop28 last year. Petro\u2019s government has had success in reducing deforestation, but its progress has been hampered this year by El Ni\u00f1o and tensions with the EMC, which controls large areas of rainforest.

            "date": "2024-07-18T00:00:19Z",
            "content": "Advocacy for the Coalition\u2019s hopes to build nuclear power plants is increasingly coming with large side-orders of misinformation, not just on the speed or costs of nuclear but on renewables. Dr Adi Paterson, the chair of the Nuclear for Australia advocacy group, has taken to attacking the credentials of CSIRO experts while going hyperbolic with his rhetoric. When Paterson told Sky News he thought the agency\u2019s report on the costs of different electricity generation technologies was \u201ca form of fascism\u201d there was not a whisper of disapproval from the surrounding studio panel. Mussolini would be turning in his grave. The definitely-not-fascist GenCost report has found electricity from nuclear would be far more expensive than solar and wind, taking into account the cost of extra transmission lines and technologies to connect, store and rerelease renewable power. Paterson claimed on the Sky news show Outsiders that the GenCost report \u201clooks at one reactor in Finland\u201d. In fact, the report had based the cost of large-scale reactors in Australia on South Korea\u2019s long-running nuclear program \u2013 one of the most successful in the world. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Entrepreneur Dick Smith, a patron of Nuclear for Australia, has also tried to claim CSIRO used a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d for nuclear costs. One leading energy analyst has previously told Temperature Check the opposite was more likely the case. Paterson, a former boss of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, said in any case, he wanted to see Australia consider 5MW micro-reactors (less than the size of a large wind turbine, suggesting Paterson would like to see Australia scattered with tiny nuclear reactors). He then pointed to Bill Gates\u2019 Terrapower company and its project in Wyoming (which has a much higher proposed generation capacity of 345 MW), saying it was currently licensed and \u201cbeing built now\u201d. In fact, as Terrapower\u2019s chief executive told CNBC a couple of months ago, the company has only just submitted its construction permit application to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and hopes to get approval in 2026. They are doing some construction at the site, but none of it relates to the nuclear aspects of the plant. Two days out of five? Paterson has claimed wind turbines only generate electricity \u201ctwo days out of five\u201d or \u201c37% of the time\u201d. Dr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems analyst at UNSW, said this was a \u201cmisleading\u201d characterisation of windfarm performance. McConnell said the 37% figure referred to something called the capacity factor \u2013 that is, how much electricity is generated over a given period relative to a windfarm\u2019s maximum capacity. \u201cIt is equivalent to implying that windfarms run at 100% of capacity two days out of five, and zero capacity three days out of five. This is of course not at all how windfarms or renewable energy generation works,\u201d he said. \u201cThey infrequently run at 100% of capacity. The converse of this is that they are often running just at levels below their full rated output \u2013 which is even more true across the whole fleet.\u201d McConnell points to data showing over the past year windfarms contributed about 12% of the total generation across the national electricity market (everywhere except WA and the NT) and while he said there was \u201ca lot of variability\u201d, there were no days when windfarms failed to generate. He said: \u201cSaying they work \u2018two days out of every five\u2019 is misunderstanding or a misrepresentation of the contribution of wind to the power system.\u201d Free pass for renewables? Conservative economist and contributor to the Australian and the Spectator, Judith Sloan, has penned several pieces in recent weeks favouring nuclear power while making questionable claims about renewables. In the Spectator, Sloan wrote that state governments \u201chave allowed renewable energy companies to avoid the normal approval processes, including environmental assessments\u201d. Firstly, renewables projects are subject to both state and federal environmental assessments. The federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, has assessed and approved more than 50 renewables projects \u2013 often with conditions attached \u2013 under current environmental laws, and rejected one windfarm in north Queensland in May because of potential impacts on nature. (The previous environment minister, Sussan Ley, also rejected a windfarm in 2020.) Marilyne Crestias, interim chief executive at the Clean Energy Investor Group, said it was \u201cinaccurate\u201d to say that projects avoided environmental assessments at state level. \u201cEach state and territory has its own set of laws governing environmental assessments for renewable energy projects. \u201cFor example, in New South Wales, large-scale renewable energy projects must undergo an environmental impact assessment (EIA) under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979. Similarly in Victoria, projects are assessed under the Planning and Environment Act 1987 for their environmental, social and economic impacts. And in Queensland, the Environmental Protection Act 1994 requires environmental impact statements (EIS) for significant projects, including renewable energy developments. These assessments ensure that renewable energy projects are developed responsibly and sustainably.\u201d Talking to Sky, Sloan has said: \u201cOne of the worst aspects of [the renewables rollout] is that these renewable investors have never entered into an undertaking that they will remediate the land.\u201d Crestias said this was a \u201cmisconception\u201d, saying developers typically did have agreements that included remediating the land. \u201cThese agreements often cover the entire lifecycle of the project, from development through decommissioning,\u201d she said. \u201cFor instance, planning permits for windfarms in Victoria require developers to submit a decommissioning and rehabilitation plan before construction begins.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-03T14:09:27Z",
            "content": "Andrei Ratiu was having a decent tournament until he got to Munich and was made to look a dud by Cody Gakpo. The full-back, with his blue hair and ability on the ball, was sent one way then the other and finally left in limbo as the Netherlands\u2019 No 11 crafted the space to crash a pinpoint shot inside the near post and open the scoring in their last-16 tie with Romania. The goal set aside some on-field nerves and the Dutch duly went on to put the Romanians to the sword. Well, eventually anyway. They crafted opening after opening and had 23 shots in total, but only six were on target, and it took until the final 10 minutes for the Oranje to seal the deal with a brace from Donyell Malen. Of those six shots on target, three were from Gakpo, who now sits at the top of the golden boot table alongside Jamal Musiala and Georges Mikautadze with three goals from his four games. Gakpo scored three times during the Qatar World Cup in 2022, too, which means half his goals as an international have come at major tournaments. Ronald Koeman mixed praise with a little joshing when assessing the performance of his forward. \u201cHis starting position is on the left side because he is really dangerous if he comes one against one with the right full-back,\u201d the head coach said. \u201cHe can go inside, outside, he has his qualities, he\u2019s strong. He then got a little bit tired and he chooses to play the nine [position]. Then he\u2019s so tired that we made the change [Gakpo was substituted in the 84th minute]. He\u2019s playing a great level this tournament, maybe the most important player until now. I hope that the rest can come to that level.\u201d In taking on Ratiu, and then later Radu Dragusin as he set up the second goal for Malen, Gakpo showed the qualities his manager was talking about. It was also reflective of what Cesc F\u00e0bregas meant when he described the 25-year-old as a \u201cfunctional\u201d player during the BBC\u2019s coverage. It may have sounded like damning with faint praise, but really the Spaniard was acknowledging Gakpo\u2019s ability to take on instruction and deploy it. F\u00e0bregas also described him as \u201cdangerous\u201d. Gakpo was the Dutch player of the year when he burst on to the international scene in Qatar and within weeks he had signed for Liverpool for \u00a335m. What has followed since has required a period of adjustment, with the player acknowledging the help he has received from his Anfield teammates when he collected his man-of-the-match award in Munich on Wednesday. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t always go how you like, sometimes you have a spell where things don\u2019t go your way,\u201d Gakpo said. \u201cBut I have a great team at Liverpool, great people who are there for you, they kept believing in me and helping me. The last few games of the season we were also good, I played good games. I took that with me and kept working hard and I\u2019m very happy I can be of value in this game tonight.\u201d Gakpo scored twice in the last three games of Liverpool\u2019s season after what, by common consent, had been an underwhelming year to that point. But the underlying numbers added a wrinkle. They showed that Gakpo was becoming more of a goal threat, taking more shots, and almost doubling the number he got on target (he went from 0.74 shots on target per game in his debut half season to 1.31 in 2023-24). These kinds of figures were comparable to his performances in the Eredivisie, suggesting that through instruction and practice he had adjusted to a higher standard of competition. This may be the Gakpo we are seeing now for the Dutch national team. Alongside all his other qualities; his height, his dribbling ability and his strength (as he showed against Dragusin), Gakpo is now becoming a reliable finisher. His first goal of the tournament was a deflection against Poland, albeit from an on-target shot, but his second against Austria was calm, efficient and into the top corner. Only a full-stretch save by Florin Nita and a desperate block by Razvan Marin prevented him from adding to his tally against Romania. In the tournament as a whole, Gakpo has now taken 11 shots and got seven on target. By comparison, the Euros\u2019 leading shot-taker Cristiano Ronaldo (no surprise there), has taken 20 shots and got nine on target. Only Ronaldo, Kai Havertz and Romelu Lukaku have been more threatening with their shot taking than Gakpo and they each play through the middle as their country\u2019s focal point of attack. The nominal No 9 for the Netherlands is Memphis Depay, who is clearly valued by Koeman but has just one (lovely) goal to his name at this tournament, alongside a whole host of misses. Xavi Simons is emerging as a key player for the Dutch at No 10 but does not boast clinical finishing as one of his key strengths. The right side, meanwhile, remains in flux. As Euro 2024 heads into its final stages, the margins will get tighter and the chances will become fewer and far between. To have a chance of winning the tournament you need a player who will take one. Gakpo might just prove to be that man for the Netherlands."

            "content": "Colombian authorities have insisted it will be safe to attend a UN biodiversity summit in Cali later this year, after a dissident rebel group threatened to disrupt the event. This week Central General Staff (EMC), a guerrilla faction that rejected the country\u2019s 2016 peace agreement, said the UN nature summit Cop16 would \u201cfail\u201d, in a post on X addressed to the Colombian president, Gustavo Petro. The warning comes amid a government clampdown on the EMC, which is active in the region near Cali where the summit will be held. The Colombian defence ministry said on Tuesday it had ended a ceasefire with parts of the EMC because of ongoing violence. A series of bombings and shootings have been blamed on the group. The Cop16 organising committee said it was working with local and national authorities to ensure a safe environment during the summit, which is due to begin on 21 October. They said they were closely monitoring the situation and working to establish the validity of the messages circulating on social media. \u201cThe safety and wellbeing of all participants, attendees and collaborators are our top priority. All security guarantees are in places to have a successful and smooth conference. We convey to all participants, delegates, media and stakeholders a message of reassurance,\u201d the statement read. About 12,000 soldiers and police are expected to be deployed for the summit, which Colombia announced it would host during UN climate talks at the end of last year. The new UN biodiversity chief, Astrid Schomaker, said she was satisfied that Colombian authorities were taking the situation seriously and she was in regular contact with the Colombian government. She said: \u201cWe\u2019ve all watched the recent tweets and other manifestations of armed groups in Colombia. The Colombian government is taking that very seriously. They\u2019re trying to track where this is coming from. There are a lot of conversations going on. I am confident that the Colombians are taking it seriously and that everything is being put in place to make Cop16 a safe and successful event.\u201d The 2016 peace deal between the Colombian government and the country\u2019s biggest guerrilla army, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), formally ended the longest-running war in the western hemisphere, which killed more than 260,000 people and forced 7 million from their homes. Thousands of rebel fighters demobilised but about 1,500 refused to sign up to the deal, and many more are likely to have returned to arms. Under Petro\u2019s presidency, Colombia has positioned itself as an international leader on environmental issues, becoming the first major oil, gas and coal producer to join an alliance calling for a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty at Cop28 last year. Petro\u2019s government has had success in reducing deforestation. But the progress has been hampered this year by El Ni\u00f1o and tensions with the EMC, which controls large areas of rainforest and has been encouraging people to cut down trees. At the last UN biodiversity summit, Cop15 in Montreal in 2022, governments agreed a once-in-a-decade deal to halt the destruction of Earth\u2019s ecosystems.

            "date": "2024-07-18T01:55:42Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s jobless rate rose in June even as employers added the most new positions since February as more people started looking for work. The unemployment rate in June was 4.1% seasonally adjusted, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. That compared with the 4.1% pace expected by economists and the 4% rate previously reported for May. The economy added just over 50,000 jobs compared with the 20,000 additional positions forecast by economists. Full-time roles rose by 43,300 and part-time positions rose by 6,800. The participation rate, one gauge of those in the market for jobs, picked up 0.1 percentage points to 66.9%. That tally was just shy of the record 67% rate set in November 2023, the ABS said. Harry Murphy Cruise, a Moody\u2019s Analytics economist, said the labour market continued to \u201cslowly soften\u201d. \u201cStill-strong employment growth and close to record-high participation highlight how the labour market remains a firewall for workers in the face of the economy\u2019s challenges,\u201d he said. The federal treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the economy had added 930,000 jobs since the Albanese government took office in May 2022 \u2013 the most for any parliamentary term. \u201cThis is encouraging but we also know persistent inflation globally and higher interest rates are weighing on our labour market and our economy,\u201d Chalmers said. The labour figures along with the June quarter inflation figures will be pored over closely by the RBA board when it next meets on 5-6 August to decide the cash rate setting. Prior to Thursday\u2019s release, investors were assessing a 25-basis-point increase in the cash rate to 4.6% next month as a 15% chance, the ASX\u2019s rate tracker indicated. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The prospects of a rate cut to 4.1% had slightly improved in recent weeks as the US and other nations move closer to interest rate cuts. Still, markets were not fully pricing that in until the middle of 2025, even if the CBA and Westpac still considered a rate cut possible in Australia before the end of this year. The strength of the job creation prompted investors to buy up the Australian dollar, pushing its exchange to 67.35 US, or a gain of about 0.15 US cents on Thursday\u2019s jobs news. Stocks added to their modest falls for the day to be down about 0.25%. Both movements suggested investors viewed the labour data as making any RBA rate cut a little less likely \u2013 and perhaps even another rate rise possible in this cycle. Blair Chapman, a senior ANZ economist, said the combination of weak consumer sentiment and economic activity should result in the labour market continuing to slow. ANZ still expected the next RBA move to be a rate cut in February. \u201cA very strong [June quarter inflation result, with the] data due 31 July, could see the RBA hike but this would be at odds with broader economic data and the expectation of cuts from other major central banks,\u201d Chapman said. Bjorn Jarvis, the ABS head of labour statistics, said \u201cthe labour market remains relatively tight\u201d, with hours increasing 0.8% even as more people than usual called in sick last month. About 4.5% of employed people in June could not work their usual hours because they were sick, compared to the pre-pandemic average for June of 3.6%, Jarvis said. \u201cHowever, we also saw less people taking annual leave in June 2024. There were around 12.5% of people working fewer hours because they were on leave, compared with the pre-pandemic average for June of 14.5%,\u201d he said. The number of unemployed people rose by 10,000 to 608,000 in June. That tally was up about 117,000 from the low reached in October 2022 and remains about 100,000 fewer than pre-Covid times \u2013 even as the workforce has increased. A separate NAB monthly survey, also out on Thursday, found business conditions eased in the June quarter as \u201cslow economic growth and soft consumer demand growth weighed on firms\u2019 trading conditions and squeezed profitability\u201d. Still, \u201cthe share of firms reporting availability of labour as a constraint was broadly steady at 79%\u201d, indicating some firms were still looking to hire. Across the nation, the lowest jobless rate was in the ACT, with unemployment diving from 3.8% in May to 3%. It also eased back in Queensland to 3.9% from 4%, with a similar decline in South Australia. Tasmania saw its jobless rate retreat to 3.7% from 4.1% in May. The big states of New South Wales and Victoria, which account for about half of the Australian economy, both posted modest rises in their jobless rates to 3.9% and 4.5%, respectively. Only the Northern Territory had a higher unemployment rate than Victoria\u2019s at 4.6%."

            "content": "More than half of the UK\u2019s film and TV workforce are still out of work a year after the Hollywood strikes of 2023, new research has found. According to a survey of more than 2,300 film and TV workers by the Bectu trade union, 52% of workers in the UK film sector are out of work, 51% in TV drama, 57% in unscripted TV and 53% in commercials. Just 6% said they have seen a full recovery in their employment since the joint industrial action by Sag-Aftra and the Writers Guild of America. The figures are down from the 68% who were out of work in a February 2024 survey, and 74% who were out of work in September 2023, which Bectu said indicates a slow recovery. However the number of respondents who are planning to leave the film and TV industry in the next five years is increasing, from 24% in September 2023 to 37% in February 2024 and 38% now. Industry diversity is particularly being affected, with 44% of Black/Black British respondents planning to leave the industry in the next five years, 41% of Asian/Asian British and 40% of mixed and multiple ethnic groups, compared to 37% for white respondents. Of those with parenting and caring responsibilities, 41% see themselves leaving the industry in the next five years, compared to 36% of those without; while the figures are at 42% for respondents with a disability and 37% for those without. Older workers are also much less likely to currently be in work, with 31% of 18-24s currently unemployed, compared to 46% of 24-34s, 50% of 35-44s, 57% of 45-54s, 58% of 55-64s and 68% of over-65s.

It feels like a long-term change. And it\u2019s been one of the hardest years I\u2019ve ever experienced, both financially and emotionally. We are not supported in any way.\u201d Another respondent, a series producer, said: \u201cI have never struggled to find work like this in 25 years. I\u2019ve had nothing at all in seven months. I feel used and discarded.\u201d Philippa Childs, head of Bectu, said little had materially improved for the workforce and \u201cdiscussions must be laser-focused on how we can collectively make things better for workers, who are critical to the sector\u2019s success but continue to bear the brunt of industry changes\u201d. She added: \u201cWith a new government in place, we are doing all we can to ensure workers\u2019 needs are top of the political agenda. \u201cIf the industry doesn\u2019t take tangible and collective action soon, we will see a huge skills exodus and a further deterioration in industry diversity, alongside prolonged mental-health challenges and debilitating financial difficulties.\u201d"

            "content": "The labor market started to ease in June, with 206,000 jobs added to the US economy last month, according to new labor data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The number of new jobs is close to what economists had expected for the month. The figures represent a slight cooling compared to May, when the economy added a revised 218,000 jobs. The unemployment rate in June was 4.1%, a 0.1% increase compared with May and the first time the rate has been above 4% in over two years. Data released earlier this week suggested the labor market was starting to cool. Payroll firm ADP reported that private employers added 150,000 jobs in June, down from 157,000 in May. Job losses also appear to be growing. Executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas reported 48,786 job cuts in June, down from 63,816 cuts in May but still a nearly 20% increase compared with June of last year. The jobs figures, released on the first Friday of every month, have been closely watched by Wall Street, which is eager to see interest rates drop, and in Washington, where the strength of hiring has been one of the few bright spots for the Biden administration, which is struggling with poor polling on its economic policies. Along with inflation figures, which come out later in the month, the Federal Reserve uses jobs figures to determine whether the economy is cooling and ready for interest rates to drop. Last month, officials at the Fed kept rates at a two-decade high of around 5.3%, where it has been for nearly a year. The Fed has been trying to bring inflation down to 2%. In May, inflation sat at 3.4% \u2013 lower than its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but still higher than the Fed\u2019s target rate. Minutes from the Fed\u2019s last meeting were released on Wednesday and showed the central bank was waiting for \u201cadditional favorable data\u201d before making cuts. But in bringing inflation down, the Fed must make sure the labor market is not cooling too much. Earlier this week, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said at an event that the economy has \u201cmade a lot of progress\u201d and has \u201cseen a pretty substantial move toward better balance\u201d in the labor market. \u201cWe want to be more confident that inflation is moving sustainably down. We want to understand that the levels that we\u2019re seeing are a true reading on what is actually happening with underlying inflation,\u201d Powell said. Inflation figures for June will be released on 11 July. The Fed\u2019s next meeting is on 30 and 31 July."

            "date": "2024-07-02T23:59:59Z",
            "content": "The release of recent data suggesting that inflation appears to be stuck at 4%, above the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s target range of 2% to 3%, has raised plenty of concern among economic and political commentators. These commentators might be surprised to learn that many, perhaps most, macroeconomists who have looked at the question have concluded that a 4% inflation rate would be the ideal target, at least providing that wages and other incomes kept pace. The underlying reasoning is simple. Interest rates are the main tool of monetary policy. In a deep recession such as that following the global financial crisis, or in an emergency such as that created by the Covid-19 pandemic, it is desirable that the interest rate should be well below the rate of inflation. That is, the real interest rate, adjusted for inflation, should be negative. But if the rate of inflation is too low, this policy is limited by the fact that interest rates can\u2019t go below zero. Well, not much below \u2013 the European Central Bank cut its policy rate to -0.5% for several years, relying on the fact that banks could take a cut in their margins, while still charging positive interest rates to borrowers. Once the zero lower bound for interest rates is reached, central banks are forced to rely on direct purchases of bonds and other securities. This policy, variously referred to as \u201cquantitative easing\u201d, \u201copen market operations\u201d or, less politely, \u201cprinting money\u201d worked to prevent economic collapse, but created plenty of problems. The majority of US economists in a 2017 survey agreed that a higher inflation target would enhance the ability of central banks to stimulate the economy during a recession. By contrast, there is no consensus on whether a 4% inflation rate would have any significant effect on the economic welfare of households. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup If a low inflation target is such a dubious idea, why was it adopted in the first place? The answer, surprisingly enough, comes from New Zealand. The first central bank to adopt an inflation target was the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in 1989. The policy was introduced by the then Reserve Bank governor, Don Brash, later to reinvent himself as a rightwing (and then far-right) politician. Brash was backed by then finance minister, Roger Douglas, whose political career followed a similar trajectory. A range of 0% to 2% was picked, without any theoretical basis, as the lowest that could plausibly be pursued. As Douglas said later, \u201cI just announced it was gonna be 2%, and it sort of stuck.\u201d While the NZ central bank was the first to adopt a 2% inflation target, others were quick to follow. The most important shift was by the US Federal Reserve, which also chose a 2% target, while initially avoiding a public commitment. At the time, New Zealand was seen as being a star performer in economic reform, likely to overtake Australia in a matter of years. Even among those who did not share in the enthusiasm, it seemed reasonable to assume that, as it had done for most of the 20th century, New Zealand would maintain living standards similar to those in Australia. In reality, though, New Zealand\u2019s economic performance has been miserable. Income per person is below the Australian level. Net emigration to Australia (currently running at around 20,000 per year) reflects the higher wages and living standards available here. While many explanations have been offered for New Zealand\u2019s relative decline, the simplest is that of repeated failures in macroeconomic management. New Zealand has experienced a string of recessions since the adoption of inflation targeting, mostly reflecting excessively rigid application of tight monetary policy. Contrary to the idea of a recession as a temporary disruption, these recessions (particularly that of the early 1990s and the global financial crisis) seem to have shifted the country onto a permanently lower growth path. Elsewhere, inflation targeting worked reasonably well until the GFC. But in the long period of depressed activity that followed, central bank interest rates were stuck at or near zero. Despite this failure, central banks retained the power and prestige they had attained in the early days of inflation targeting. Unsurprisingly, they have been highly resistant to any change to inflation targets, even though they have no convincing defence of the status quo. Instead, they rely on the fact that any change would be bad for faith in the central banks. The recent review of the RBA spells this out. After conceding the strength of arguments for a higher inflation target, the review panel concluded: \u201cRegardless of the merits of higher inflation in general, the Review does not recommend increasing the inflation target during the present period of high inflation. To do so could undermine the credibility of the RBA in responding to future periods of above-target inflation.\u201d Of course, once we have ground our way back down to the target, the idea of raising it will be dismissed; it would be throwing away costly gains. So, if you are struggling with higher interest rates or worried about higher unemployment, remember that this is the price we have to pay to restore the \u201ccredibility\u201d of the Reserve Bank.

Just yesterday the IMF revised down predictions for economic growth this year from 1.5% to 1.4%. With unemployment at 4.0% (the June figures will come out later on Thursday), are things not doing OK? Yes, but including underemployment, which has been rising, the level of underutilisation (which counts both unemployment and underemployment) has risen from a low of 9.5% in February last year to 10.7% in May. If the graph does not display click here While that is lower than we have experienced for over a decade, it suggests that jobs are now harder to get. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup And when we break down the numbers further, the strength of the labour force reflected through the low unemployment rate seems rather fragile. Commonwealth Bank economists posted an interesting graph that highlighted how jobs are mostly coming from the public and non-market sectors: If the graph does not display click here Excluding public administration, healthcare and social assistance, and education and training, total hours worked has actually fallen in the past year: If the graph does not display click here That overall employment is holding up and unemployment is remaining low is clearly good, but that this is largely being driven by public-sector work \u2013 and especially jobs under the NDIS \u2013 does not suggest a booming economy in dire need of slowing. And you might have noticed that at this point I have only focused on jobs and not on cost of living or inflation. While these are front-of-mind for people, inflation does not actually tell us much about how the economy is faring. It\u2019s for this reason that I have never put too much store in things such as the \u201cmisery index\u201d, which combines inflation and unemployment to give a measure (supposedly) of how miserable we all are. With inflation and unemployment both at 4.0%, the misery index for Australia is 8.0%. That is the same as a decade ago, when inflation was 1.7% and unemployment was 6.3%. If anyone thinks Australians would be no less miserable if we had an extra 343,000 unemployed but with lower inflation, please feel free to volunteer your job to the cause. If inflation was being driven by a booming economy we would also expect to see wages surging. And yet wage growth has peaked and real wages are barely growing at all. On this score it was good of the OECD to remind us that workers have seen their living standards destroyed over the past couple of years. In its latest employment outlook, the OECD noted that real wages have fallen more than most other economies and \u201care still 4.8% lower than they were just before the pandemic\u201d in December 2019. If the graph does not display click here To underline how massive that loss is, note that 4.8% of $80,000 is $3,840. So when you hear that real wages have fallen by 4.8% that is like hearing someone on $80,000 losing nearly $4,000 worth of services and goods that they were able to afford in 2020 but cannot now. While wages are finally growing faster than prices, the OECD noted with superb understatement that \u201chouseholds are still facing pressure under the cost-of-living crisis\u201d. This of course comes down to interest rates. Interest rates slow the economy, by making it tougher for consumers to spend money in shops and on services, and thus harder for businesses to hire more workers because the work is not there. When we think of it this way it seems rather obvious why market sector jobs are not growing. Worse still, the signs are that there is little good news ahead. In June just 39% of employers recruited new staff \u2013 down from 47% at the end of last year: If the graph does not display click here And only 18% of employers were expecting to increase their staff in the next three months \u2013 down from 20% in December last year and 21% a year ago: If the graph does not display click here This again is a sign not of an economy needing to be restrained but one that has slowed and, rather than about to rebound, is set to slow even further. That will be good news for those who are suffering from rate rises because it suggests the Reserve Bank will be unlikely to raise rates in August. But the bad news is that even if the RBA keeps rates on hold, the impact of all the rates rises continues to flow through the economy. For now, unemployment has remained low but the chance that it will start rising is becoming rather more likely than it once was. And a further rate rise would only make that chance almost certain.

            "date": "2024-07-23T14:25:10Z",
            "content": "Vandals ransacked an Israeli-Palestinian restaurant in Berlin, smashing wine glasses and defiling the space with \u201cdisgusting acts\u201d a week after it hosted a queer Jewish-Muslim brunch, its owners have said. Kanaan, a casual eatery in the Prenzlauer Berg district of the city, has attracted national attention since the 7 October attacks on Israel by Hamas, for its message of \u201cunity over hate\u201d. Its owners, Oz Ben David, an Israeli, and Jalil Dabit, a Palestinian, have called it an \u201cisland of peace\u201d. After the attack, which occurred at the weekend, Ben David and Dabit posted on Instagram to seek support and donations from the restaurant\u2019s loyal patrons. \u201cA week ago, we hosted a beautiful Jewish-Muslim brunch at Kanaan Berlin, a morning filled with unity and love,\u201d they wrote, referring to a running series of LGBTQ+ events the restaurant puts on. \u201cWe received some online responses following the event, but nothing more than that \u2026 until this morning.\u201d Next to a photograph of overturned chairs and spilt wine, they said the restaurant had been targeted by a \u201cdespicable act of vandalism\u201d in which nothing was stolen. \u201cDespite this cowardly attack, we want to make one thing clear \u2013 Kanaan will not cower to threats and hate,\u201d Ben David and Dabit said. Ben David said the restaurant, which was founded in 2015, is called Kanaan \u201cbecause that\u2019s what the land was called before it became Israel and Palestine\u201d. Its slogan is: \u201cMake Hummus Not War.\u201d He said that the vandals had spread faeces on the floor and the walls of what he calls their shared \u201ctemple\u201d and had broken furniture and smashed bottles from the bar. Ben David said he would travel to the Middle East next month to support joint projects with Dabit, who is now with his family in Ramallah, aimed at fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians \u2013 a goal he admitted had become ever more elusive since the war in Gaza broke out. About 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage in Hamas\u2019s attacks on Israel on 7 October. Israel\u2019s subsequent military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, mostly civilians, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to speak about peace. It\u2019s much harder now to convince people, to pull people and push them toward peace,\u201d said Ben David. \u201cI want to make the difference and to be part of the solutions and not to hunt the problems and to point fingers.\u201d This week Kanaan scaled back its opening hours to allow for the clean-up and police investigation but vowed to keep operating. A Berlin police spokesperson confirmed it had launched an inquiry. Ben David said a \u20ac15,000 fundraising goal to cover lost \u201cequipment, furniture, and income\u201d had been surpassed in the first 24 hours thanks to donors from across Germany. Kanaan intends to continue the campaign to finance \u201cprojects that promote Israeli and Palestinian coexistence and foster political education for tolerance and mutual understanding among young people in Germany\u201d."

            "date": "2024-07-17T14:55:19Z",
            "content": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s efforts to style himself as a high-level peacemaker by meeting world leaders including Vladimir Putin are \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cnot in the interest of Europe\u201d, the Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, has said, recalling lessons from attempts to appease Adolf Hitler before the second world war. The Hungarian prime minister has stoked controversy in recent weeks for embarking on what he has termed a \u201cpeace mission\u201d while his country holds the Council of the EU\u2019s rotating presidency. The international trips have involved meetings with Putin, China\u2019s Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. In a wide-ranging interview in Prague, Fiala said Orb\u00e1n\u2019s efforts were helping only the Kremlin as it pursued its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \u201cWhat Viktor Orb\u00e1n makes, it\u2019s not in the interest of Europe, it\u2019s not in the interest of my country, it\u2019s not in the interest of Ukrainian people,\u201d the conservative Czech leader told the Guardian on Wednesday. \u201cUnfortunately, it helps Vladimir Putin in this situation. And it\u2019s wrong.\u201d His remarks came as the European parliament condemned Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Russia trip as \u201ca blatant violation of the EU\u2019s treaties and common foreign policy\u201d and said Budapest should face repercussions. Fiala, a political scientist who has been serving as the Czech Republic\u2019s prime minister since 2021, stressed the importance of learning from history, pointing out that historical attempts to appease dangerous regimes had not worked. \u201cMany people believed that if we give some territory to Hitler or if we will discuss with Hitler it will prevent the war \u2013 the opposite was right,\u201d he said, citing the 1938 Munich agreement that permitted German annexation of the Sudetenland in what was then western Czechoslovakia. \u201cPeace is only possible if the aggressive state, aggressive regime, understands that we are so strong that it\u2019s not good for this regime to be aggressive with military forces. So it\u2019s very, very clear: the past is the teacher of all of us,\u201d Fiala said. The Czech Republic and Hungary used to be close partners as part of the \u201cVisegrad four\u201d together with Poland and Slovakia, but the regional grouping has grown apart over the past few years. Under Fiala\u2019s government the Czech Republic has been leading a drive \u2013 involving about 20 countries \u2013 to urgently procure ammunition for Ukraine from outside the European Union, while the bloc works to boost production. The Czech prime minister said a first shipment was made in June and further help was in the pipeline. \u201cWe want to send till the end of this year 500,000 pieces of ammunition, which is now realistic because we have everything that we need, financing and also we know where the ammunition is and we organised it,\u201d he said. Fiala said Europe needed to step up assistance to Ukraine and to boost its own defences. Asked if he was concerned about the possible impact of the upcoming US election, including the choice of an isolationist, JD Vance, as the Republicans\u2019 vice-presidential candidate, Fiala recalled discussions he had had in Washington with American lawmakers. \u201cMy feeling was that the people understand very well what happened in Europe,\u201d he said, adding that he was sure the next administration would stand by Ukraine. But he also stressed: \u201cIt\u2019s maybe the most important thing: I am sure, as a political scientist and also as a politician, that Europe must be more responsible for its own security.\u201d He continued: \u201cIn this question, it is not so important if the next president will be Joe Biden or Donald Trump, because the United States has different, other interests in the world, and it\u2019s not possible and also it\u2019s not OK if we in Europe always hope or believe that our security is guaranteed by the United States. \u201cThe transatlantic cooperation is important for all the western world, for western democracies \u2013 it must be \u2013 but we must be more responsible, we must care more about our defence, we must increase our defence expenditure.\u201d Fiala, whose Civic Democratic party (ODS) sits with the European Conservatives and Reformists group together with Giorgia Meloni\u2019s Brothers of Italy, also warned of Russia\u2019s efforts to weaken European societies. \u201cIt\u2019s a classical hybrid war,\u201d he said, citing disinformation and attacks targeting infrastructure. He said the Russian regime wanted to make Europeans \u201cunsatisfied with governments, with politics, with structures of democratic society\u201d. The Czech prime minister is an unusual figure among European leaders, with experience as a scholar of political science and as a politician. He has worked as a university rector and professor, with his research interests including European politics. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary in my mind to separate the political scientist approach and the activities of prime minister,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always an advantage to understand things, to know things, to know the history, to understand the politics also theoretically \u2013 it\u2019s not automatic that if you are successful scholars you will be successful politicians, but for me it\u2019s an advantage.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-20T15:51:43Z",
            "content": "Adam Peaty says he has had to drastically change his relationship with winning, no longer tying his results to his general happiness, in order to recover from the most difficult period of his career and pursue a potential third consecutive gold medal in the 100m breaststroke at the Paris Olympics. \u201cMy relationship with a gold medal now is I know that it won\u2019t solve any of the problems that I want it to,\u201d said Peaty, who is working through his final preparations at Team GB\u2019s pre-Olympics preparation camp in Reims before his arrival in Paris. \u201cWhen you\u2019re younger, you\u2019re like: \u2018If I get a gold medal, it\u2019s gonna solve so many problems.\u2019 And it does, but it\u2019s not going to solve the problems that I seek [to resolve]. And obviously now I do it to win, I want to be the best. I am the best. I\u2019ve still got the world record. And I\u2019m going to have a good challenge come Paris. That\u2019s the only thing that gets me excited.\u201d In his first two Olympic cycles Peaty made dominance look simple, constantly winning by massive gaps and carrying himself with a distinct outward confidence. He broke records seemingly for fun, becoming the first man to dip under 58sec in the 100m breaststroke and then, while the world was still failing to catch up, going on to break the 57sec barrier. The past three years, however, have tested the 29-year-old in ways he could have never imagined. Since 2021, he has split from his former partner Eiri Munro, the mother of their three-year-old son; he suffered a broken foot; and he seriously considered retirement after surviving what he described as a breakdown that caused him to become reliant on alcohol as an escape from his problems. In order to make it back for a third Olympic Games, Peaty has had to approach his sport differently. \u201cWhen you have children, when you hug them, you realise that it is something greater than anything can ever provide,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I touch the wall, if it\u2019s not the result I want I\u2019ll be disappointed. But before, in comparison, in 2021, even 2022 and way before that, I\u2019d be almost tearing myself apart that my life isn\u2019t worth living, because I lost. That isn\u2019t sustainable because that\u2019s not an attitude to have. \u201cI\u2019m not defined as a human by that. Maybe an athlete and maybe other people will define me that way. But I\u2019ll still have my family; they\u2019re healthy, they\u2019re happy. The sun always rises the next morning no matter what. That\u2019s not defeatist, in any sense. That just gives me peace, so you can attack.\u201d During this period, Peaty has found peace in attending church and therapy. Having spent much of his career loudly declaring his greatness, he says he is a lot calmer. Still, while he believes making it to Paris is an immense achievement, his goals in the pool are unchanged. \u201cGetting to the starting line is a huge one for me, but I feel like I\u2019m already at the starting line now. If you\u2019re at the holding camp, you\u2019re pretty much at the starting line, and the focus now goes from: \u2018OK, I\u2019m here,\u2019 to: \u2018How do I turn it into a win?\u2019 So that\u2019s where the focus is.\u201d Alongside Peaty, Great Britain\u2019s 33-member swimming team are also undergoing their final preparations in Reims. In Tokyo, Duncan Scott became the first British athlete to win four medals at a single Olympics with two individual silvers and a gold and silver in the relays. Scott said he hopes the Olympics will positively affect swimming in the UK, whether at grassroots or performance level. \u201cEither way it\u2019s a real positive. Also the time difference, with it only being an hour, that\u2019s going to be a real benefit for Britain. Not just for swimming, but for all sports as well. The spectator value from British people is going to be huge.\u201d For Freya Colbert, a 20-year-old who specialises in the 400m medley, this will be a particularly interesting moment. In February, she won gold at the world championships. But Summer McIntosh, the dominant 17-year-old Canadian swimmer whose world record is 10 seconds faster than Colbert\u2019s personal best, was not present in Doha and will be the heavy favourite in Paris. Colbert has had to wrap her head around coming into the Olympics as the reigning world champion yet still being an underdog. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely taken a little bit of getting used to \u2013 initially there was a little bit of anxiety, like: \u2018Ah, I\u2019m going in as the world champion but I\u2019m not really hoping to win, I\u2019m just hoping to make it on the podium,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cJust learning how to deal with that and everything that comes with it is something that has been really valuable. I just feel pretty relaxed and quietly confident that I\u2019ll be able to put together a good race and a PB for myself, which is all that I can do.\u201d"

            "content": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that Russia should be represented at a second peace summit in November, after a first summit convened by the Ukrainian president last month in Switzerland to which Moscow was not invited. Both sides have shunned direct peace talks since negotiations between Russian and Ukraine delegations fell through in the early weeks of Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022. But during a press conference in Kyiv after his visit to the US for a Nato defence alliance summit, Zelenskiy opened the door to direct talks with officials from Moscow. \u201cI believe that Russian representatives should be at the second summit,\u201d Zelensky said, describing preparations for a follow-up gathering of Ukraine\u2019s allies. In the same news conference, Zelenskiy said Ukraine needs 25 Patriot air defence systems to fully defend its airspace, adding that he also wants western partners to send more F-16 warplanes than those already pledged. A six-month delay in military assistance from the US, the biggest single contributor to Ukraine, meant that Kyiv\u2019s forces had \u201clost the initiative\u201d on the frontline, Zelenskiy said. Top EU officials will boycott informal meetings hosted by Hungary while the country has the EU\u2019s rotating presidency, after Hungary\u2019s pro-Russian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n held a series of rogue meetings with foreign leaders about Ukraine that angered European partners. The highly unusual decision to have the European Commission president and other top officials of the body boycott the meetings was made \u201cin light of recent developments marking the start of the Hungarian [EU] presidency\u201d, commission spokesperson Eric Mamer posted on Monday on X. US journalist and author Masha Gessen was convicted in absentia on Monday by a Moscow court on charges of spreading false information about the military and was sentenced to eight years in prison. The Moscow-born Gessen, a staff writer for The New Yorker and a columnist for The New York Times who lives in the US, is a prominent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and an award-winning writer. A Ukraine drone attack sparked a fire at a factory producing electrical devices and components in Russia\u2019s Kursk region, the interim governor of the region bordering Ukraine said early Tuesday. \u201cNone of the workers were injured,\u201d Alexei Smirnov, the governor, said on the Telegram messaging app. A Russian military court on Monday granted house arrest to a general and former commander in Moscow\u2019s Ukraine offensive who has been charged with fraud. Major-General Ivan Popov was released from behind bars Monday after being arrested in May on suspicion of large-scale fraud, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Ukraine said Monday that a military serviceman allegedly attempting to flee the country illegally had been shot dead by a border guard after being caught and detained. The State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) said four servicemen were apprehended while approaching the Moldovan border by foot in the southern Ukrainian region of Odesa on Sunday. \u201cWhile trying to cross the border, border guards noticed them and detained them,\u201d the SBI said. \u201cOne of the fugitives attacked the border guard while trying to escape. In response, he used his service weapon and shot the attacker.\u201d"

            "content": "We were sitting under a giant sweet chestnut at the top of a steep field tumbling down to the River Dart, like a rivulet of mercury winding north to Totnes and beyond to Dartmoor, whose crooked granite tors look like approving thumbs. Greenfinches chirred and a song thrush went through its dial-up modem repertoire. A lone seal lolloped on the estuary mud, lazily waiting for the tidal river to reclaim it. \u201cI come into the peace of wild things / who do not tax their lives with forethought / of grief \u2026 \u201d, whispered Frank, leading our group\u2019s nature walk. \u201c\u2026 for a time / I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.\u201d Frank took a long breath, as if to deeply ingest Wendell Berry\u2019s poem, and then asked us to summon up our earliest memories of nature. I saw my five-year-old self, in 1969, on his first trip from the inner city, sprinting up a Lake District hill like an animal sprung from captivity. This reflection on nature and memory was part of a six-night wildlife discovery and meditation retreat at Sharpham House, an exquisite 18th-century Palladian mansion set in 222 hectares (550 acres) of south Devon parkland, high above an elbow of the Dart. In 1982, Sharpham was turned into a charity by its then owners, Ruth and Maurice Ash, and dedicated to helping people cope with the stresses of modern living. Unsurprisingly, in 2024 it finds itself more in demand than ever. It offers a growing range of meditation courses, all with nature at their core, and four retreat centres, the newest of which \u2013 the Coach House, converted from a Grade-II listed stable yard in 2022 \u2013 I was staying at. I was hoping that Sharpham might help with my anxiety: once an occasional visitor, now a perennial guest, seemingly agitated by every fresh convulsion in our world. Our days started with a gentle wake-up bell at 7am \u2013 no phone alarms for us, as Sharpham requests devices be handed in \u2013 followed by 15 minutes of qigong, a series of slow movements and breathing exercises, under a sprawling 1,500-year-old yew, a tree revered by the ancients as a symbol of death and resurrection. Most of us were barefoot in the dewy grass, the electric jolts of cold shocking. Afterwards, the group, myself and 12 women, aged from about 25 to 75, walked slowly and soundlessly \u2013 retreat guests are silent from 9pm until after breakfast \u2013 to the Coach House\u2019s meditation room. There, we were led through a practice by the retreat\u2019s two coordinators, Caroline and Jude, focusing on the breath. Breakfast in silence on the first morning was disconcerting. In what would ordinarily have been a time of excited communion with strangers, we sat and focused on the food on our plates \u2013 the colours, the smells, the flavours. My knife against the plate sounded like a train on a tight curve. After a few slow, mindful mouthfuls, I was full. As the week progressed, that silence for a few hours after waking felt increasingly sublime and spacious, divine almost \u2013 one member of our group would later describe it as \u201ctimeless time\u201d. That first morning was Frank\u2019s nature walk (he, like all of the coordinators, was a volunteer, taking a year\u2019s sabbatical from his usual life). He told us about Sharpham\u2019s rewilding drive, now in its fourth year, where the crops, vineyards and most of the sheep had been removed, wildflower meadows sown, and animals such as mangalica pigs and konik ponies introduced to roam freely, with the aim of replicating the actions on the land of their wild ancestors, boar and tarpans respectively. After lunch, always vegetarian, always fabulous \u2013 Sharpham\u2019s organic kitchen garden provided many of the ingredients, and the menu during my week included aubergine and tofu curry, apricot and fennel tagine, cashew chocolate cheesecake and cheeses from the Sharpham Dairy \u2013 afternoons were generally free of formal activities. These I spent wandering around the Capability Brown-designed gardens, or through the fabulous woodlands of redwood, holm oaks and handkerchief trees, fat and full in June, walking slowly, inhaling deeply, with intention and curiosity. Every few steps, I would stop to stare in wonder at rows of pennywort, standing tall as if on parade, presenting their delicate little golden bells for inspection, or clusters of cerulean alkanet. On other days I walked, chaperoned by gyring swallows, through the wildflower meadows, planted only last year yet already a riotous profusion of clover, cornflowers, poppies, oxeye daisies and, vitally, yellow rattle, known as the meadow-maker for its role in balancing soil after intensive grazing. Nearly always, I ended up at the river, for hours, watching its tidal breath as cormorants skimmed across its whorls, their pulsing wings like heartbeats. Every evening there was an hour of group meditation, often prefixed by retreatants being invited to share their feelings. There was much talk of grief and loss, of lingering Covid trauma, of struggles with the demands of modern life. We were invited to lie down and close our eyes as Caroline gently called out our names, one by one, and invited the group to send us love and care and asked that we do the same to ourselves. By 9pm we were all in bed. Who knew being so relaxed could be so exhausting? Other nature experiences during the week included a wildflower and foraging safari, where we ate oxeye daisies, traditionally used to treat sore throats, zingy sorrel flowers and the leaves of lemon verbena, which tasted like sherbet; and a bug safari, where we dashed around with nets in the long grass with childlike glee and rushed back to Fraser, the insect expert, to proudly show him our haul. There were bird walks, walks focused on trees or moths, or the tiny lesser horseshoe bats that flittered out in the crepuscule from their roost in the Coach House roof, and to whose chattering echolocations we listened on bat detectors. Sometimes, we walked just paying attention to the rhythm of our feet and our breath. On our final evening, we sat in a circle under the ancient yew tree around a fire bowl. We sang a song together. There was laughter, not an iota of judgment. Each of us was given a pine cone to project something on to we wished to leave behind before committing it to the flames. The old me would have said \u201ccynicism\u201d, especially of such rituals, but I seemed to have been relieved of that, so instead I went for \u201canxiety\u201d, and the group intoned: \u201cLet it be so.\u201d And then we sat, in silence, resting in the grace of the world. Wherever You Go, There You Are is the title of Jon Kabat-Zinn\u2019s seminal 1994 book on mindfulness meditation, from a saying often attributed to Confucius. Whenever I\u2019d heard it, it had always felt like a curse. As I drove away from Sharpham House, it felt just a little more like a blessing. Mike Carter was a guest of the Sharpham Trust on its six-night Wildlife Discovery retreat. The standard cost is \u00a3545, although guests can select different rates according to need. This includes accommodation in a single room, all food and drink, and expert-led walks and talks"

            "content": "Aston Martin sales went into reverse in the first six months of 2024 but the luxury carmaker says it expects a recovery in the second half as it completes an update of its model lineup. The FTSE 250 company said the number of cars sold to dealers fell by a third to 2,000, while first-half losses rose by 52% to \u00a3216.7m. But its share price rose by more than 6% on Wednesday as it promised an \u201cexciting\u201d second half and a pickup in sales. The 111-year-old company, best known as the maker of cars in the James Bond spy film series, nearly went bust for an eighth time in 2020 but was saved by Lawrence Stroll, the billionaire fashion mogul. Since then, Stroll has struggled to turn the company around, first by trying to restore an air of exclusivity to the brand by reducing the number of cars held by dealers and sponsoring a Formula One race team, and then by releasing new models. It has launched a new Vantage sports car and the DBX 707, an update of the sports utility vehicle that has played a significant role in increased sales. Alongside its DB12 and Vanquish sports car models, it means the carmaker has an all-new lineup, with updated infotainment systems that addressed some criticism of previous models. Stroll said the launch of the sports cars and the SUV was a \u201cpivotal moment\u201d for the company after years of trying to turn it around. The former Bentley boss Adrian Hallmark will take over as chief executive under Stroll, who is chair, in September. Stroll said Aston Martin would start generating cash later this year, as the benefits of heavy investment finally bore fruit. \u201cWe have a big third and fourth quarter coming up,\u201d he added. Aston Martin will still have big investments ahead, most notably in the shift to electric cars. None of the models it has made so far are electric, although it plans to release a plug-in hybrid version Valhalla super car in 2026, a year later than initially planned. There have been questions over whether the Labour government will reinstate the ban on new petrol and diesel cars in the UK in 2030, after the Conservative former prime minister Rishi Sunak delayed it until 2035. Labour committed to putting it back to 2030 in its manifesto. However, Aston Martin\u2019s chief financial officer, Doug Lafferty, said the company hoped to benefit from allowances for smaller manufacturers to continue to sell cars up to 2035. He told reporters: \u201cThe current legislation allows for a derogation for small volume manufacturers, and we don\u2019t see any deviation from that.\u201d Aston Martin was not alone in reporting a decline in the first half. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the number of new cars leaving UK factories fell by 7.6% to 416,074 between January and June. But it said the drop was expected, due to carmakers overhauling their production lines to make electrified models."

            "date": "2024-07-15T11:52:17Z",
            "content": "Pressure on Beijing to take steps to improve Chinese consumer confidence has intensified after news that weak retail spending dragged down the growth rate of the world\u2019s second biggest economy. With falling house prices still acting as a drag on activity, official figures showed the Chinese economy expanding at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter \u2013 much weaker than the 5.1% expected by the financial markets. Annual retail sales growth slowed from 3.2% to 2% in the three months ending in June \u2013 the weakest in 18 months \u2013 and fell slightly in June alone. Lynn Song, the chief China economist at ING bank, said retail sales growth was the lowest since the country emerged from Covid-19 lockdowns and showed the depressed state of consumer confidence remained a big headwind to the economic recovery. \u201cA negative wealth effect from falling property and stock prices, as well as low wage growth amid various industries\u2019 cost cutting is dragging consumption and causing a pivot from big-ticket purchases toward a basic \u2018eat, drink and play\u2019 theme,\u201d Song said. The government in Beijing has set a growth target for 2024 of 5% \u2013 something analysts consider to be a stretch in the absence of tax cuts, spending increases and measures to help the property market. On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded by 0.7% in the three months to June, compared with a downwardly revised 1.5% in the first quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said. To counter soft domestic demand and its property crisis, China has increased infrastructure investment and ploughed funds into hi-tech manufacturing. Strong export growth has partly compensated for the reluctance of consumers to spend. Figures released last week showed China\u2019s exports in June were up 8.6% from a year earlier, while imports shrank by 2.3%. Duncan Wrigley, the chief China+ economist at Pantheon Macro, said: \u201cThe property market is showing tentative signs of bottoming out. New home prices sank 0.67% month on month in June, a trivial improvement from the 0.71% drop in May. Preowned home prices dropped 0.85%, after the 1.00% dive in May. Residential sales value fell 12.2% year on year in June, partly thanks to base effects, after crashing 26.4% in May.\u201d"

            "content": "The pace of US economic growth accelerated in the last quarter, remaining unexpectedly resilient in the face of high interest rates and persistent inflation. Gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of economic health \u2013 rose 2.8% in three months to June, the commerce department reported on Thursday, ahead of economists\u2019 expectations and up sharply from 1.4% in the first quarter. It comes as the presidential election campaign heightens scrutiny of the US economy. While Joe Biden touted the \u201cstrongest economy in the world\u201d as he announced his withdrawal from the race on Sunday, Donald Trump \u2013 who is running to replace him in the White House \u2013 has accused Biden of weakening the economy. In a statement, Biden said: \u201cWhen I took office, we were in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Today\u2019s GDP report makes clear we now have the strongest economy in the world.\u201d Biden said there was \u201cmore to do\u201d over the final six months of his term. \u201cThe vice-president and I will keep fighting for America\u2019s future \u2013 a future of promise and possibilities, of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things,\u201d he said. Despite relatively rosy economic figures, nearly three in five Americans wrongly believe the US is in recession, and the majority blame the Biden administration, according to a Harris poll conducted for the Guardian in May. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve scrambled to bring down inflation from its highest level in a generation, raising interest rates to a two-decade high. They are now considering when to start cutting rates, amid early signs that price growth is falling back towards the Fed\u2019s 2% target. \u201cThis is a perfect report for the Fed,\u201d Olu Sonola, head of economic research at Fitch Ratings, said of Thursday\u2019s GDP numbers. \u201cGrowth during the first half of the year is not too hot, inflation continues to cool and the elusive soft landing scenario looks within reach.\u201d Economists had expected GDP growth of about 2% in the second quarter. Some have questioned how the US economy will fare later this year as high rates take their toll. \u201cWe expect a slowdown from here,\u201d economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics told clients earlier this week, \u201cdriven by the mounting pressure from high interest rates, which likely are only now starting to exert their full impact on the real economy, given the long lags involved.\u201d Associated Press contributed reporting"

            "date": "2024-07-22T14:47:35Z",
            "content": "When Laura Kudrna bought her home on the Ladywood estate in Birmingham, it brought to an end a 12-year period of renting in which she\u2019d moved 20 times. \u201cI was so excited to be able to stay in a home that I thought I would have for life,\u201d she said. But her new sense of security was shattered when she found out that her property was one of 1,900 dwellings listed for potential demolition in what is thought to be one of Europe\u2019s biggest single-site estate regenerations. The scale of the proposed project is staggering: 6,000 people could have their homes torn down as part of a \u00a32.2bn project in which 1,266 council houses and 567 properties belonging to private homeowners could be repossessed in a mass compulsory purchase order for the area. In their place, 7,500 homes will be built in a high-density housing plan on a 61-hectare (150-acre) site. About 1,000 of these will be designated as affordable council-owned homes, according to a report presented to cabinet. If the numbers involved seem imposing, the strength of feeling in opposition to the plan is more than a match. Residents said they were furious and accused the council of \u201cpsychological economic violence\u201d. The battle lines have been drawn over familiar terrain. Birmingham Council described the initiative as the most significant redevelopment project in a generation, in a city where there is an urgent need to build more housing. The number of people who presented to the council as homeless rose to 600 a week last year. On the other side of the debate, Kudrna, 39, is a member of the Ladywood Unite campaign which is voicing people\u2019s concerns about the project. They say they understand the need to increase the housing stock, but not through the demolition of good homes. She said: \u201cThey appear to be planning to knock down good-quality and new housing for this. It is just so egregious. We are absolutely pro-home building. There\u2019s a lot of great land to build on in Ladywood, like this building is derelict, and this building is derelict,\u201d she said, pointing to vacant land near her home. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they just build on those instead of coming after our homes?\u201d The project will be done in phases over a 15- to 20-year period, and compulsory purchase orders would be used as a last resort, the council said. Homeowners would be entitled to a compensation package and the council was exploring options to help people living on the site buy the new homes, for example through shared equity. The council said it intended to take a \u201cbuild-first approach\u201d, meaning people would not be moved out of their homes until a new property became available on site, and would ensure no one had to leave Ladywood if they did not want to. Some people said they were sceptical this would happen. George Smith, who is retiring from his job as the head of an academy trust when he turns 60 this summer, had planned to spend his free time enjoying life at the home he bought when it was built 30 years ago. It sits on a modern, well-maintained estate, but it falls within the red line of the proposed demolition zone, and is at risk of being flattened. \u201cI own the freehold. I\u2019ve put everything in here, this was a lifelong home. I had no thoughts I would ever need to move and, if I did, it would be on my own terms,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the real injustice of it all, and at the same time the council are being totally incompetent at meeting with us.\u201d The regeneration scheme has been beset by problems for months. At a consultation meeting held by the council last year, nearly 100 residents were unable to get into a community centre packed to capacity, prompting an angry crowd to form outside. \u201cThere has been a horrible lack of community engagement,\u201d said Kudrna. \u201cWe\u2019ve really struggled to get the council to meet us, or give us any information. It\u2019s psychological economic violence, truly.\u201d Marco di Nunzio, an associate professor in urban anthropology at the University of Birmingham, is studying the Ladywood regeneration scheme. \u201cBirmingham is seeing a return to what used to happen in the 60s, taking down entire areas and rebuilding them,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin the UK, there are town-planning laws which allow, if there is a public interest, the local authority to seize assets. \u201cBut is the Ladywood regeneration project in its present form actually in the public interest, if it involves displacing a large number of people to make room for a commercial endeavour, with no firm and binding commitment to deliver social and affordable housing?\u201d Ladywood has a large black and minority ethnic population \u2013 58%, compared with 51% in Birmingham as a whole \u2013 and high levels of poverty and deprivation. It has the highest child poverty level of any constituency in the UK. Di Nunzio said there were real fears people could be priced out of the area and there was a significant psychological impact of the upheaval. \u201cThe opacity of the process, that open-endedness when you\u2019re losing your home is excruciating. There is a huge issue of anxiety, some parts of the community are quite vulnerable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe level of injustice that you might experience, it really affects people\u2019s sense of self.\u201d The Labour government has set out plans to build 1.5m homes in its first term, and cross-party concerns have been raised about the risk of overriding community issues in the process. Ladywood residents said they feared the big push for more homes could put freehold properties at risk of demolition as part of similar schemes to increase housing density. Jayne Francis, the council\u2019s cabinet member for housing and homelessness, said: \u201cWe know that much of the community in Ladywood feels frustrated and uncertain about what the scheme means for them, and we\u2019d like to apologise for any distress caused.\u201d She added that the only decision that had been made was to appoint St Joseph, a subsidiary of the housing company Berkeley Group, as the council\u2019s preferred development partner. \u201cNo other decisions have been made on the regeneration scheme or what homes will or will not be demolished. The regeneration of Ladywood is right at the beginning of the process, with many decisions yet to be made with the community.\u201d Francis said the council was developing a \u201ccommunity and resident charter\u201d to set out its commitment throughout the project, and a second round of engagement workshops had begun. \u201cWe will work hard to rebuild trust with the Ladywood community and to make the most of this exciting opportunity to revitalise an area that was primarily built in the 1960s,\u201d Francis said."

            "date": "2024-07-13T12:00:19Z",
            "content": "For a chancellor targeting a decade in power, Rachel Reeves is in a hurry. After 14 years in the wilderness for Labour, and several centuries of Britain awaiting its first female chancellor, it\u2019s not surprising she is keen to get on with the job. So far, two ideas have predominated: blaming the Conservatives for the worst economic inheritance since the second world war, and laying the foundations for national renewal at breakneck speed. Reeves says there isn\u2019t any time to waste to get Britain on track for the highest sustained levels of growth in the G7. But it is a task that will involve tough trade-offs and challenges, and will come to define Keir Starmer\u2019s government. In the scramble to look busy, ministers have been hurriedly working behind the scenes to reshape the institutions of Whitehall and get the government machine aimed at Reeves\u2019s primary objective. One quick win was the creation of a new council of economic advisers, housed within the Treasury and led by top London School of Economics academics John Van Reenen and Anna Valero. More changes are due in Wednesday\u2019s king\u2019s speech, including the government\u2019s legislative plans for workers\u2019 rights, planning reform, the NHS and Great British Energy, Ed Miliband\u2019s prized low-carbon power company. Sources say we can expect a big announcement on infrastructure, too. The government is keen to show it is committed to getting mega-projects built after the stop-start failures of the Tory years. There is a rush to finalise plans, including the potential abolition of the National Infrastructure Commission, which would be replaced with a new body. Elsewhere, Starmer is setting up \u201cdelivery boards\u201d packed with external experts for his five key \u201cmissions\u201d for government: growth, energy, crime, education and health. The challenge, though, is whether the reforms will succeed in getting Britain\u2019s economy back on track. Successive governments have carried out similar tyre changes on the Whitehall motor, only to end up with the wheels spinning on the road to prosperity. This time Labour is preparing to rely heavily on the private sector, in acknowledgment of tight constraints on the public finances. After the Tories\u2019 Brexit-era \u201cfuck business\u201d approach, there is obvious latent potential to unlock. However, the government ought to be realistic about how far this might go. For decades, the UK has trailed comparable rich nations on business investment \u2013 a fact made worse by the economic vandalism of austerity, Brexit, and the churn of Conservative prime ministers. Figures from Capital Economics show total investment in the UK has shrunk from 26% of GDP in the late 1980s to 18% today \u2013 a bigger decline than the rest of the G7. That suggests Labour is aiming to get from the bottom of the investment league table to the top: the equivalent of Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016, a 5,000-1 dream come true. Bringing about stability will help. The UK now stands as a beacon of relative calm in an increasingly volatile world. There will be further tailwinds as inflation cools, and the Bank of England is likely to cut interest rates soon. Reeves\u2019s new national wealth fund could help encourage investment in some certain parts of the economy, as part of a broader modern industrial strategy \u2013 details of which are said to be in the pipeline. However, Labour\u2019s manifesto implies cuts to public investment as a share of GDP from the current starting point, putting even more weight on the private sector to lead the charge in Britain\u2019s unlikely Leicester-inspired campaign. Unlocking more private capital could require the government to be bolder with its own investment plans. To do so without deviating from Labour\u2019s tax promises, Reeves could use the review of public spending she commissioned last week to pave the way for changes in the government\u2019s fiscal rules. The chancellor is also said to be keen to revamp the Office for Budget Responsibility, including a request for reports on the long-term impact of capital spending decisions. Currently, the Treasury watchdog publishes five-year forecasts. But this fails to capture the benefits from big infrastructure programmes, which can take longer to materialise. Such a change could help strengthen the case for investment. There is ample evidence that this might be a good idea, including from Van Reenen and Valero, who were among the authors of a report earlier this year calling for a temporary boost to public borrowing to drive investment in sustainable technologies and infrastructure. \u201c[It] would prove cost-effective and beneficial to living standards and economic competitiveness by increasing productivity and economic growth,\u201d they wrote. In the early days of Labour\u2019s putative decade in power, this could have the biggest effect on growth."

            "date": "2024-07-27T15:00:28Z",
            "content": "I bought an iPhone 15 the other day to replace my five-year-old iPhone 11. The phone is powered by the new A17 Pro chip and has a terabyte of data storage and accordingly was eye-wateringly expensive. I had, of course, finely honed rationales for splashing out on such a scale. I\u2019ve always had a policy of writing only about kit that I buy with my own money (no freebies from tech companies), for example. The fancy A17 processor is needed to run the new \u201cAI\u201d stuff that Apple is promising to launch soon; the phone has a significantly better camera than my old handset had \u2013 which matters (to me) because my Substack blog goes out three times a week and I provide a new photograph for each edition; and, finally, a friend whose ancient iPhone is on its last legs might appreciate an iPhone 11 in good nick. But these are rationalisations rather than solid justifications. The truth is that my old iPhone was fine for the job. Sure, it would need a new battery in time, but apart from that it had years more life in it. And if you take a cold, detached look at the evolution of the iPhone product line, what you see from the 2010 iPhone 4 onwards is really just a sequence of steady incremental improvements. What was so special about that model? Mostly this: it had a front-facing camera, which opened up the world of selfies, video chat, social media and all the other accoutrements of our networked world. But from then on, it was just incremental changes and price rises all the way. And this is true not just for iPhones but for smartphones, generally. Samsung, Huawei, Google and other manufacturers have been on the same path. The arrival of the smartphone signalled by the launch of the first iPhone in 2007 represented a sharp discontinuity in the evolution of mobile phone technology. (If in doubt just ask Nokia or BlackBerry.) There then followed a massive surge for a decade or so, until the technology (and the market) matured and incremental changes became the rule. Mathematicians have a name for this process. They call it a Sigmoid function and draw it as an S-shaped curve. When you apply it to consumer electronic devices, the curve looks like an \u201cS\u201d that\u2019s been flattened a bit. Progress is slow at the bottom; then it takes a sharp upward turn, before eventually flattening out at the top. And smartphones are now on that part of the curve. If we look back at the history of the tech industry over the last five decades or so, we can discern a pattern. First there\u2019s a technical breakthrough: the silicon chip; the internet; the web; the mobile phone; cloud computing; the smartphone. Each breakthrough is followed by a period of frantic development (often accompanied by investment bubbles), which propels the technology up the middle bit of the \u201cS\u201d; and then eventually things calm down as markets become saturated and radical improvements in the tech become more and more difficult to achieve. You can perhaps see where this is heading: to so-called \u201cAI\u201d. It\u2019s already had its initial breakthroughs: first, the arrival of \u201cbig data\u201d produced by the web, social media and surveillance capitalism; then the rediscovery of powerful algorithms (neural networks), followed by the invention of the \u201ctransformer\u201d deep-learning architecture in 2017; and then the development of large language models (LLMs) and other forms of generative AI of which ChatGPT was the poster-child. We\u2019ve now had a period of frenzied development and insane amounts of corporate investment (with no clear idea of what the returns on that investment will be), which has propelled the technology up the central part of the sigmoid curve. So interesting questions now arise: how far up the sigmoid curve has the industry climbed thus far? And when will it reach the plateau, where smartphone technology currently reclines? In recent weeks we\u2019ve begun to see signs that that moment may be approaching. The technology is being commoditised. The AI companies have started to release smaller and (allegedly) cheaper LLMs. They won\u2019t admit this, of course, but that may have something to do with the way the energy costs of the technology are ballooning. The industry\u2019s irrational boosterism cuts little ice with economists. And while millions of people have tried ChatGPT and its peers, most of them haven\u2019t displayed enduring interest. Virtually every large company on the planet has had an AI \u201cpilot\u201d project or two, but few of them seem to have made it into actual deployment. So could it be that this sensation du jour is about to get boring? A bit like the latest shiny smartphone, in fact.

            "date": "2024-07-18T18:05:37Z",
            "content": "For much of the last two months we have been treated to an Ed Davey extravaganza. Bungee-jumping Ed. Roller-coasting Ed. Family Man Ed. Caring Ed. NHS-saving Ed. It\u2019s been quite the ride. No other politician felt quite so alive, quite so human, so relatable during the election campaign. And it all paid off. Ed, leader of the Lib Dems, had given the party their best result in decades, gaining 72 MPs. They were relevant again. Well, almost. On Thursday we got to see a rather different Ed at the Post Office Inquiry. One that had been kept well away from public consumption. This was, at times, a Shifty Ed. At others a Bewildered Ed. An Ed who couldn\u2019t believe what had happened to him. Pontius Ed. This was the Ed from the dark days of the beginning of the coalition years when he was the junior minister with the Post Office brief invading the present. The past coming back to haunt him. A past he would rather forget. This Ed chose to open his evidence with an apology. He was very sorry he had initially declined a meeting with the former post office operator Alan Bates. He couldn\u2019t think what had come over him, though he was sure the fault lay with the civil servants in his department. He was also deeply sorry he hadn\u2019t been able to see through the lies he had been told by the Post Office boss class. If only Bates had tried to warn him \u2026 After many long nights of the soul, and countless sessions with his therapist, Ed had come to see that he was the real victim in the Horizon scandal. His was the reputation that had been dragged through the mud. Curiously, this was also the conclusion that Paula Vennells and several over senior Post Office bosses had reached in the witness stand. They were the ones with the right to be aggrieved. They were the ones who had been traduced. How typical of the post office operators to try to make it all about them. Selfish to the last. Jason Beer, lead counsel to the inquiry, interrupted this little dream sequence to bring us back to reality. Could we get back to what Nice Mr Ed knew about Horizon during his time in office? That was very simple. He had known the bare minimum at all times though he now wished he had known more. He blamed his officials for keeping him in the dark. No greater love hath any man than this, than he throws his colleagues under a bus to save his own skin. Remind me, said Ed. What was all this about Horizon? He was dying to know. The thing was that he had always been far too important to deal with minor matters like one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in the last 50 years. When he had become Post Office minister he had been told to keep operational matters at arm\u2019s length. His job was to work purely at a strategic level. In fact, he had followed this instruction so diligently that he hadn\u2019t even realised the Post Office was entitled to instigate its own private prosecutions against its staff. The same excuse that Vennells had given in her own testimony some months ago. It had never occurred to either of them to understand the governance model of the organisation of which they were notionally in charge. Far too much like hard work. It was somebody else\u2019s job to educate them. In fact, the only people in the entire country who knew the Post Office could conduct its own prosecutions were a few men and women in the prosecutions department of the Post Office. And they had all gone rogue. It gradually became apparent that, at some point in his first few weeks in the job, Caring Ed had been told about Horizon. But only to the extent that a few officials had comforted him with the news that it wasn\u2019t a problem. Just a few moaning post office operators who had been caught with their fingers in the till. It must be nice to have officials whose only job is to warn you that something isn\u2019t a problem. How wonderful to be as incurious as Ed. Not to think \u2013 even for a nano-second \u2013 that there might be something wrong going on. That not every post office operator who was complaining of an injustice might be making it up. But not Brain-Dead Ed. He had his officials to tell him everything was tickety boo. He had a hotline to the Post Office Execs. And besides, he wasn\u2019t the sort of man to go poking his nose into corners where it wasn\u2019t. Ed was the establishment man through and through. He hadn\u2019t got where he had by rocking the boat. There were further conundrums. Ed couldn\u2019t remember ever having received a letter, soon after he had assumed office, from Bates requesting a meeting to discuss Justice for Sub-Postmasters. Incurious Ed narrowed his eyes and stroked his chin. To try to look authentic. As if he really was bothered. He was sure he would have recalled reading the letter if he had been shown it because its tone was quite forceful. But he couldn\u2019t quite explain why he had then sent a reply basically telling Bates to piss off and stop bothering him. A meeting would serve no useful purpose. He had lunches to eat. Naps to squeeze in. This was just the way Nice Ed rolled. Always sending replies to letters he didn\u2019t think he had ever read. No one in the public gallery was terribly impressed by any of these. At times there were murmurs of discontent. At others open derision. This lot weren\u2019t entirely convinced by Mr Open Ed. Honest Ed. Then neither was Beer. He presented Ed with a whole list of letters from MPs asking him to look into a potential miscarriage of justice on behalf of their constituents. Tired Ed shook his head sadly. He had just thought it was all a coincidence. Nothing to see here. And it would have been wrong to intervene in the judicial system. Far better to let innocent people go to jail. We ended with a second letter from Bates and the eventual meeting. Ed hailed this as an act of heroism on his part. Sticking it to the man by ignoring the advice of his officials. Plucky Underdog Ed. Except Beer pointed to a briefing document that had suggested Ed take the meeting for \u201cpresentational reasons\u201d as there was a Channel 4 investigation forthcoming. Ed was horrified at the suggestion. Perish the thought. We never did learn what came of the meeting because no one had thought to keep the minutes. Almost certainly nothing, as Ed and the department never changed their attitude towards the post office operators. Ed must be so proud. He even offered some advice to Wyn Williams, the inquiry chair, on possible future areas of redress. A sharper, better informed, government minister would have been a start."

            "date": "2024-07-04T03:38:48Z",
            "content": "The world\u2019s oldest known picture story is a cave painting almost 6,000 years older than the previous record holder, found about 10km away on the same island in Indonesia, an international team of archaeologists has said. The painting, believed to be at least 51,200 years old, was found at Leang Karampuang cave on the east Indonesian island of Sulawesi, researchers from Griffith University, Southern Cross University and the Indonesian National Research and Innovation Agency wrote in the journal Nature. Samples were collected in 2017, but weren\u2019t dated until earlier this year. The previous record holder was a lifesize picture of a wild pig believed to be created at least 45,500 years ago in a cave at Leang Tedongnge. The recently discovered painting is of three therianthropes \u2013 or human-animal hybrids \u2013 and a wild pig. Adhi Agus Oktaviana, the lead author and a PhD student at Griffith University, said the findings were \u201cvery surprising \u2026 none of the famous European ice age art is anywhere near as old as this with the exception of some controversial finds in Spain\u201d. Spanish scientists have previously claimed art at three sites \u2013 in Cantabria, Andalusia and Extremadura \u2013 was more than 64,000 years old. However, according to Dr Tristen Jones, a rock art expert at the University of Sydney, those findings were \u201clargely rejected by the international science community\u201d. Jones said it was unclear if the Spanish researchers dated limestone that had formed on top of the art, or if the limestone had formed elsewhere. The findings were also controversial because the researchers argued Neanderthals made the art. It had previously been believed that only modern humans made art. Jones said the Spanish researchers had not clearly established the crusts that were sampled formed on top of the art. The findings were also controversial because the researchers argued Neanderthals made the art. The finding contradicts the academic view that early figurative cave art consisted of single figure panels rather than scenes where figures interacted with each other. The researchers used uranium series dating to date the layers of calcium carbonate that had formed on top of the art. It involved extracting limestone samples that were then vaporised with a laser. The age of the sample was calculated by measuring the ratio of thorium to uranium. The researchers said this method allowed the layers to be dated more accurately by ensuring younger and older materials were not mixed together. The researchers also dated art at a nearby cave \u2013 Leang Bulu\u2019 Sipong 4 \u2013 that was previously believed to be the oldest cave art in the world. They found that the artwork, once believed to be at least 44,000 years old, was at least 48,000 years old. However, the site of the former oldest known cave painting at Leang Tedongnge could not be dated using the newer method, as there was no calcium carbonate material remaining. Jones said the new method was \u201ca major leap forward in tightening up the resolution and accuracy of dating\u201d. Typically, she said, rock art is extremely difficult to date as the art is predominately made from minerals. Adam Brumm, a professor from Griffith University who jointly led the study, said that in the several excavations he had conducted in the region, there were frequent depictions of the warty pig. \u201cThey were clearly economically important to these early people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can see they were also important to them symbolically and perhaps even spiritually\u201d. However, the researchers said the events taking place in the artwork were \u201cdifficult to interpret\u201d, and it was unclear what animals inspired the human-animal hybrids as they were drawn as \u201cessentially stick figures\u201d. \u201cFor whatever reason \u2026 early humans \u2026 [are] rarely depicted any form that could be reasonably interpreted as a human,\u201d Brumm said. \u201cAnimals were often drawn with incredible anatomical fidelity, but [early cave painters] put less effort into doing that.\u201d He said the researchers were fairly certain one of the human-animal hybrids was a human with the head of a bird, and another had a tail, believed to be that of a civet. \u201cStorytelling is a hugely important part of human evolution and possibly even helps to explain our success as a species, but finding evidence for it in art, especially in very early cave art, is exceptionally rare.\u201d"

I remembered my dead colleague, dead patients and a dead friend. But I also remembered our first informal meeting in the NHS, when the possibility of a new pandemic was briefly and nonchalantly discussed. That was in October 1999. Labour was in power and our focus was on innovation and modernisation across the NHS. I was a passionate enthusiast for all this new policy \u2013 a cheerful foot soldier for change. Sound familiar? My contribution as a senior NHS change leader between 2002 and 2005 was to help build a new learning system or infrastructure that included a health observatory capable of horizon scanning for any threats to the NHS and, by default, to the public. This innovation was one arm of the new NHS University, which was designed to provide an integrated learning system across the health sector. The two areas of concern were pandemics and climate change. We learned from the HIV/Aids work in South Africa that we must \u201clearn faster than a virus\u201d to stand any chance of succeeding in overcoming the impact of new viruses. How did many health department colleagues react to this? It was considered \u201cnice to have\u201d in civil service speak. Our attempt to speak the truth to power resulted in these organisations being expired and many of us with them. In the report, Lady Hallett states that warnings were not heeded and that learning was not integrated into NHS culture. This has a familiar ring about it, as the earlier Kennedy report into the Bristol Royal infirmary scandal came to similar conclusions. Everything changes and everything remains the same. Edward Rosen Former head of learning, NHS University, 2002-05 \u2022 Prof Devi Sridhar\u2019s response to the first report of the Covid-19 inquiry does not mention systemic racism as a factor contributing to the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on some ethnic minority communities (The Covid inquiry report makes it clear: Britain was completely and fatally unprepared, 18 July). While lack of preparedness and underlying health inequalities did contribute to Britain faring poorly, they do not fully explain the disproportionate impact on people of Black, Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds. During the pandemic, the Guardian was at the forefront of reporting that doctors and nurses from these communities were more likely to die from Covid-19. Our work demonstrated that the nature of the work (in public-facing, key worker roles) and the living conditions (in urban, crowded areas) of people from these communities increased their risk of infection and death. By avoiding the need to address systemic racism, the inquiry\u2019s recommendations risk repeating the mistakes made during the pandemic. It is hoped that the new government will take these issues seriously and work towards tackling racial inequality. Jabeer Butt CEO, Race Equality Foundation \u2022 There is no great difficulty in knowing what actions need to be taken to prevent another pandemic \u2013 merely copy what is generally done with Ebola.

Will Ukraine turn into Starmer\u2019s Iraq?, 15 July). Western leaders across the board seem to have forgotten the promises made to Mikhail Gorbachev more than 30 years ago, assuring him of our commitment to not extend the borders of Nato into the old Soviet bloc. Since then, we have seen numerous former Soviet states join Nato, leaving Russia encircled to the west, with hostile missiles, troops, tanks and planes now pointing in its direction from its own backyard. Russian discomfort at this situation over the past 20 years has been ignored, and it is my belief that the invasion of Ukraine was entirely due to the fear that Ukraine too would be accepted into the Nato alliance. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a single western leader or military strategist who is seeking to understand the Russian position; they seem to think it\u2019s perfectly acceptable for Nato to extend its sphere of influence into Russia\u2019s back garden. Those who forget the lessons of history are destined to repeat its mistakes. Ironically, our best hope of averting the third world war may turn out to be the election of Donald Trump. He is a narcissistic maniac, but he would appear to be the only leader who appreciates the danger of this new era of western imperialism. He alone understands the futility of pouring billions into a war that Ukraine cannot win without Nato troops on the ground and planes in the sky. Nato appears to have a severe case of groupthink; meanwhile, the survival of human civilisation is in grave danger. Jonathan Gorse Milland, West Sussex \u2022 Simon Jenkins thinks that Putin \u201cneeds to be extricated\u201d from the \u201cterrible mistake\u201d he made in marching on Kyiv and that it is the duty of Nato and the west to oblige him in this, presumably by pressurising Volodymyr Zelenskiy to give up territory in the east. He also slates Zelenskiy for the deaths of thousands of conscripts, with no mention of the many thousands of deaths that Putin\u2019s \u201cmistake\u201d has inflicted on his own countrymen, never mind Ukraine. Placating Putin with territory will not work. What Nato and the west need to do, and should have done from the start, is to offer Ukraine the support it needs to push Putin back to the extent Ukraine itself decides is sufficient. And Jenkins needs to extricate himself from the dreadful mistake of thinking otherwise. Karen Miller Beckenham, London \u2022 Vladimir Putin may well have made a terrible mistake invading Ukraine, but he decided to burn the bridges by declaring the Donbas and Crimea to be Russian territory \u2013 he cannot negotiate any compromise without losing face (and, by implication, his power). That is the dilemma for the west. Losing Ukraine to Russia will encourage further expansion, Moldova and Georgia being obvious targets. The Baltic states and, ultimately, Poland have reasons to be wary. I always favour diplomacy, but I fail to see how meaningful peace negotiations could take place in the current situation. Of course, Putin\u2019s empire, wedded to a course of permanent expansion, will eventually collapse, like all empires. But at the moment, sadly, I see no alternative to stopping this expansion by all means necessary.

            "date": "2024-07-24T10:00:06Z",
            "content": "A surge in new oil and gas exploration in 2024 threatens to unleash nearly 12bn tonnes of planet-heating emissions, with the world\u2019s wealthiest countries \u2013 such as the US and the UK \u2013 leading a stampede of fossil fuel expansion in spite of their climate commitments, new data shared exclusively with the Guardian reveals. The new oil and gas field licences forecast to be awarded across the world this year are on track to generate the highest level of emissions since those issued in 2018, as heatwaves, wildfires, drought and floods cause death and destruction globally, according to analysis of industry data by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD). The 11.9bn tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 which is roughly the same as China\u2019s annual carbon pollution \u2013 resulting over their lifetime from all current and upcoming oil and gas fields forecast to be licensed by the end of 2024 would be greater than the past four years combined. The projection includes licences awarded as of June 2024, as well as the oil and gas blocks open for bidding, under evaluation or planned. Meanwhile, fossil fuel firms are ploughing more money into developing new oil and gas sites than at any time since the 2015 Paris climate deal, when the world\u2019s governments agreed to take steps to cut emissions and curb global heating. The world\u2019s wealthiest countries are economically best placed \u2013 and obliged under the Paris accords \u2013 to lead the transition away from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources. But these high-capacity countries with a low economic dependence on fossil fuels are spearheading the latest drilling frenzy despite dwindling easy-to-reach reserves, handing out 825 new licences in 2023, the largest number since records began. Classic \u201cpetrostates\u201d such as Saudi Arabia or Russia \u2013 which rely heavily on oil and gas revenues to balance their budgets \u2013 have faced criticism for slowing action on the climate crisis. Yet countries including the UK, the US, Canada, Norway and Australia are increasingly being thought of by some experts as the \u201cother petrostates\u201d , given they have access to financial and technological resources that would make the energy transition less disruptive. While they are often portrayed as climate leaders on the world stage, these five wealthy countries are responsible for more than two-thirds (67%) of all new oil and gas licences issued globally since 2020. \u201cThe logical first step in a \u2018transition away\u2019 from oil and gas is to stop opening new fields,\u201d said co-author Olivier Bois von Kursk, who is a policy adviser at the IISD. \u201cSo it is deeply concerning that exploration activity has not just continued since the Cop28 agreement but increased. Rich countries with relatively low dependence on fossil fuel revenues should be the first to stop issuing licences. We\u2019re not seeing that in the data.\u201d Under the Biden administration, the US has handed out 1,453 new oil and gas licences, accounting for half of the total globally and 83% of all licences handed out by wealthy nations. This is 20% more than during the term of Donald Trump, who has promised to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d should he return to the White House. The oil and gas industry continues to invest big in political influence in petrostates, spending $1.25bn (\u00a31bn) on lobbying in Washington and more than $650m (\u00a3504m) in campaign contributions over the past decade, according to Open Secrets. Meanwhile, the UK handed out more licences than any other country in May, although it is China, the world\u2019s leading carbon emitter, that is forecast to approve the most oil and gas blocks in the rest of 2024. The UK\u2019s newly elected Labour government has pledged to stop new drilling, but it\u2019s unclear whether the glut of licences doled out by the outgoing Conservative party can be cancelled. The new analysis of Rystad industry and government data by the IISD also shows: Over the past decade, new licences issued by high-capacity, low-dependency countries including the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and Norway are estimated to have contributed five times more greenhouse gas emissions between 2014 and 2023 than all other oil- and gas-producing countries combined. The US, which has become the world\u2019s largest oil and gas producer by a huge margin in recent years, led the way in 2023 by issuing a record 758 new licences for extraction projects \u2013 almost as many as the previous three years combined. The total number of projected licences by the US for 2024 would lead to an estimated 397m tonnes of emissions. The UK is forecast to hand out 72 oil and gas licences this year, which would result in an estimated 101m tonnes of planet-warming pollution, a 50-year high. Norway is projected to hand out 80 oil and gas licences this year, resulting in 771m tonnes of greenhouse gas pollution \u2013 threatening the biggest contribution to global emissions since 2009 and the equivalent of putting 183m new gasoline-powered cars on the road. Australia is forecast to award 20 new licences in 2024, which if it happens could generate an estimated 217m tonnes of carbon pollution in the long term \u2013 the most since 2009 and more than the past five years combined. The latest data shows that Russia will account for three-quarters of global emissions resulting from new licences awarded in June, according to a new monthly IISD newsletter. The amount spent by major oil and gas companies on exploring and developing new wells has climbed significantly since the Covid-19 pandemic, with $302bn to be spent on well development this year, the most in a decade. The UK, Norwegian and Australian governments disputed some of the figures and defended their climate policies. The US and Canada did not respond. The glut of new oil and gas activity comes as July is on track to be the 14th hottest consecutive month on record, as communities across the world grapple with deadly extreme weather and slow-onset climate disasters such as sea level rise and melting glaciers. The last decade was the hottest ever recorded, with 2023 the single hottest year. A recent study found the world has enough fossil fuel projects planned to meet global energy demand forecasts to 2050 \u2013 if governments deliver the changes promised in order to keep the world from breaching its climate targets. But the oil and gas rush, led by the richest countries, risks demolishing hopes that the world can stay within internationally agreed-upon limits aimed at preventing catastrophic heatwaves, wildfires, flooding and other impacts. No new oil and gas project can proceed if the Paris agreement, which calls for global temperatures to be restrained to a 1.5C (2.7F) rise above preindustrial levels, is to be met, according to the International Energy Agency. Despite this, countries are pushing ahead with a huge expansion in oil and gas activity, identifying and developing new resources at a pace not seen since the Paris deal was inked in a wave of optimism in 2015. The world\u2019s consumption of fossil fuels climbed to a record high last year even as investment into clean energy such as solar and wind started to eclipse coal, oil and gas. PetroChina, the Chinese state-owned oil and gas arm, has spent the most on both exploration and well development over the past decade, with ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco, Sinopec and Chevron among other businesses sinking the largest investments in new oil and gas. So far in 2024, the three dozen or so high-capacity, low-dependency countries including the US, the UK and Norway have issued 121 new licences \u2013 more than the rest of the world combined. The newly licensed reserves in rich countries \u2013 which are smaller and harder to reach because the larger reserves have already been exploited \u2013 could eventually generate 172m tonnes of CO2, the equivalent that would be produced by 43 new coal plants. Those are the same countries that are also ploughing ahead with huge tax giveaways for industry-led \u201csolutions\u201d like carbon capture and storage and \u201cblue\u201d hydrogen that independent experts say are inefficient, unjust and economically damaging. The data reveals a deep-seated inequity \u2013 and a key climate justice issue \u2013 that developing countries have for years tried to raise at the annual UN climate talks. In order to honour their legally binding obligations under the Paris agreement, developed countries must go first when it comes to phasing out fossil fuels, starting immediately, and stopping expansion plans. \u201cThe hypocrisy of wealthy nations, historically responsible for the climate crisis, is staggering as they continue to invest heavily in fossil fuels \u2013 putting the world on track for unimaginable climate catastrophe while claiming to be climate leaders,\u201d said Harjeet Singh, global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative. \u201cDespite having the economic means to transition away from fossil fuels, these nations are petrostates choosing profit over the planet, undermining global efforts to avert the climate emergency.\u201d Mega-licences \u2013 big blocks that will result in the most emissions \u2013 are typically awarded in developing countries such as Mozambique, which have a low capacity to transition away from oil and gas. Developed countries have contributed the most to the climate crisis and benefited the most from fossil fuels, while developing countries have contributed least but are suffering the worst effects \u2013 in part because they do not have equal access to mitigate, adapt and recover from climate impacts such as drought, floods, wildfires and extreme heat. \u201cThe US has become a petrostate and is still, even under President Biden, permitting new drilling,\u201d said John Sterman, a climate policy expert at MIT. \u201cThe developed countries don\u2019t show any significant efforts to limit drilling, but it\u2019s not just them. Guyana and countries in south-east Asia are also aggressively seeking to expand exploitation activity. This is about national policy but it\u2019s also being driven by the oil companies.\u201d Sterman said there was a \u201cfundamental contradiction\u201d between the promises made by countries at annual UN climate summits and the ongoing oil and gas expansion. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep going on like this,\u201d he said. Just five global north governments \u2013 the US, the UK, Australia, Canada and Norway \u2013 are responsible for a majority (51%) of planned expansion from new oil and gas fields through 2050, and they stand out as the biggest climate hypocrites, according to the Planet Wreckers report by Oil Change International last year. The Biden administration has defended its record \u2013 even as the US entrenched its position as the world\u2019s largest oil and gas producer. John Podesta, Biden\u2019s top climate adviser, said last month that US production was \u201ca good thing, because following the illegal invasion of Ukraine, and the need that Europe had to rely on different sources rather than Russia fossils, it was important that the US could step up and supply a good deal of that need\u201d. Podesta added: \u201cBut over time, the science is clear, we\u2019ve got to transition away and begin to replace those resources with both zero carbon electricity and renewable resources.\u201d Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has previously defended the country\u2019s climate policies and hailed its 2030 emissions reduction plan, and in April this year said it was on a solid path towards its reduction targets while making \u201chistoric investments in clean technology\u201d. A spokesperson for the UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \u201cMaking Britain a clean energy superpower is at the heart of the government\u2019s agenda, securing our energy independence and tackling the climate crisis \u2026 We will not issue new licences to explore new fields and will not revoke existing oil and gas licences. We will manage existing fields for the entirety of their lifespan.\u201d Elisabeth S\u00e6ther, Norway\u2019s petroleum ministry state secretary, said that her country was committed to cutting its emissions. \u201cAt the same time, we see that the world will still need oil and gas,\u201d she added. \u201cEurope will remain dependent on imports from other regions for many years. Norwegian oil and gas can contribute to a sustainable, affordable and secure energy supply.\u201d A spokesperson for the Australian government said: \u201cReaching net zero, and decarbonising our economy as quickly as possible, remains front and centre of the Albanese government\u2019s agenda. \u201cOur energy policies are sensible and pragmatic, focused on delivering the shift to clean, cheap energy that Australians deserve, bringing down prices for households and businesses while also cutting emissions.\u201d Earlier this month, Hurricane Beryl, the earliest category 5 storm ever observed in the Atlantic, ripped a path of destruction through the Caribbean, Mexico and Texas, leaving at least 11 people dead and thousands homeless. In the aftermath, Ralph Gonsalves, the prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines, where Beryl \u201cflattened\u201d one island and severely damaged others in the archipelago, said: \u201cWhat we see here are the consequences of a rampaging climate change. We are in the era of the Anthropocene. And the developed countries, the major emitters, are not taking this matter seriously. \u201cThe world, if we don\u2019t move to net zero, we are going to be a very inhospitable place to be in another two, three decades. I mean, this is not scaremongering; this is science. And we are on the frontlines of this.\u201d On Thursday in The other petrostates series: The Trans Mountain contradiction: how can Canada lead on climate while doubling down on oil?"

            "date": "2024-07-14T05:00:41Z",
            "content": "The chicken industry is facing calls to halt the expansion of intensive production in the River Severn catchment, with campaigners warning that the river is at risk from the same pollution that has blighted the River Wye. An outcry over the ecological plight of the Wye has effectively halted the proliferation of intensive poultry units across the catchment. Campaigners say that the pollution threat is being transported \u201cfrom one catchment to the other\u201d. The ecological health status of the Wye was downgraded in May last year by Natural England. Campaigners warn of phosphates from poultry litter that are being washed into the Wye and fuelling the growth of algae blooms, which can suffocate a river. River Action, a charity promoting the restoration of rivers, is now supporting an application for judicial review of a decision by Shropshire council to approve four units to house 230,000 birds at Felton Butler, Shropshire, in the Severn catchment. Charles Watson, chairman of River Action, said that planners in the Wye catchment had failed to consider the combined effect of intensive poultry units. He warned that the River Severn now faced a similar threat. Watson said: \u201cLike an appalling car crash in slow motion, exactly the same set of tragic events is now unfolding in the neighbouring catchment of the River Severn. Shropshire council is waving through the planning system more and more huge intensive poultry-unit applications. \u201cRiver Action is determined to prevent a re-run of the environmental scandal of the Wye taking place across yet another one of the UK\u2019s iconic rivers.\u201d The application for judicial review says that the council failed to assess the likely effects of manure and biomass emissions. The farm has proposed various mitigation measures to reduce manure pollution, emissions and odour. The planning documents state: \u201cno manure arising from the poultry sheds will be spread on the land; it is taken to a licensed waste treatment.\u201d River Action says that the planning conditions do not prevent the phosphate-rich digestate from the processed manure being spread on other land in the catchment. The application has been made on behalf of Alison Caffyn, a rural researcher who has helped collate data on intensive poultry production in the catchments of the Wye and Severn. She estimates that there are about 250 intensive poultry units and 30m birds in the western catchment of the Severn, including Shropshire and Herefordshire. She said: \u201cThey just look at each individual planning application one by one. They are not doing a good job of assessing the cumulative impacts.\u201d The Angling Trust last year reported a \u201cworrying level of pollution\u201d after taking water samples on the Severn. It published data last year showing that 11 sites had a mean average that exceeded the upper limit of the UK water framework directive for phosphates. Stuart Singleton-White, head of campaigns at the Angling Trust, said that the Severn faced pollution from sewage discharges, agriculture and run-off from roads. \u201cThe Angling Trust hopes the new government grasps the urgent need for restorative action on the Severn, and across all the UK\u2019s badly polluted rivers,\u201d he said. A Shropshire council spokesperson said: \u201cThe decision to grant planning permission was made having taken full account of the likely environmental impacts of the proposal. \u201cThe permission includes a number of conditions to control how the development is carried out, and the operation would also be regulated under an environmental permit. Shropshire council has received a claim form for judicial review of the decision to grant planning permission and is considering its position.\u201d An Environment Agency spokesperson said: \u201cWe remain committed to protecting watercourses across the country and working with farmers to meet their regulatory requirements and reduce diffuse pollution.\u201d Officials said that planning permissions were decisions for local authorities."

            "date": "2024-07-29T05:00:14Z",
            "content": "Labour\u2019s clean energy targets may already be in jeopardy just weeks after the party came to power with the promise to quadruple Britain\u2019s offshore wind power, according to senior industry executives. The offshore wind industry has said there will not be enough time to develop the projects needed to create a net zero electricity system by the end of the decade unless ministers increase the ambition and funding of the government\u2019s upcoming \u201cmake or break\u201d subsidy auctions. A delay to Labour\u2019s planned renewable energy rollout \u2013 which calls for a doubling of onshore wind, tripling of solar power and quadrupling of offshore wind capacity \u2013 would also risk derailing Britain\u2019s legally binding climate ambition to be net zero overall by 2050. \u201cIt\u2019s crunch time,\u201d said Damien Zachlod, managing director of the UK arm of the German energy company EnBW. \u201cHow close we get to the government\u2019s 2030 offshore wind target depends on whatever happens in the next 18 to 24 months.\u201d The government may have already missed its chance to meet its 2030 target, according to Zachlod, because \u201cthe fastest that you could develop an offshore windfarm is seven years\u201d and \u201cmore often than not it takes 10 to 12 years\u201d. Senior wind power executives fear the industry may fall further behind the 2030 target because the government\u2019s summer auction for offshore wind subsidy contracts, which are paid through home energy bills, is only large enough for a fraction of the developers eager to build windfarms off the UK coast to secure a deal. They have called on Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, to almost double the budget for the \u00a3800m auction so that more projects can secure a contract and accelerate the industry\u2019s progress towards the 2030 target. The intervention comes after one of the UK\u2019s leading energy analysis providers warned that a \u201cstep-change\u201d in government policy was required to bring forward \u00a348bn in private spending to close the renewable investment gap needed to meet its 2030 targets. The government set out plans last week for GB Energy, its state-owned power company, to partner with the king\u2019s property management firm, the crown estate, to accelerate the development of enough offshore wind to power 20m homes. This is expected to benefit projects that begin generating electricity in the 2030s but do little to meet the near-term target. Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, one of Britain\u2019s biggest renewable energy investors, said that even if the government allows more developers to compete in the auction this summer there will \u201cstill be developers lining up to compete for contracts in the auction in one year\u2019s time\u201d. This is partly because the previous Conservative government failed to award a single offshore wind contract in last year\u2019s auction by setting the price too low, in what critics have called the biggest clean energy policy failure in almost a decade. Anderson added that there was a \u201cvery low risk\u201d of the new government saddling households with higher energy bills by encouraging more projects to be built because the cost of offshore wind is below forecasts for future energy market prices. \u201cThere is a big opportunity here to invest in the future of the UK\u2019s clean growth, and a lot of projects which are ready to take that up. Now is the time for the government to go faster,\u201d Anderson said. Nathan Bennett, the head of communications at RenewableUK, said more than 10GW-worth of new offshore wind was eligible for bids in this summer\u2019s auction, but the current funding available would only be enough for half this capacity. He said the green energy trade body was urging ministers to raise the budget to allow for more winning bids to \u201cmake up lost ground\u201d from last year\u2019s auction and create the substantial pipeline of projects needed to accelerate supply chain investment and growth in the UK. RenewableUK is understood to have called on ministers to nearly double the \u00a3800m funding pot for offshore wind to \u00a31.5bn in the upcoming auction. The government has also set aside \u00a3105m for a separate auction for floating windfarms, which should it raise to \u00a3464m, according to the trade group. \u201cWe need to make the UK the most attractive business environment to secure the maximum amount of private investment in clean energy in the face of intense international competition,\u201d Bennett said. A government spokesperson said Miliband was \u201ccarefully considering\u201d whether to increase the budget for the summer auction and would \u201cconfirm his decision soon\u201d."

            "date": "2024-07-25T04:00:37Z",
            "content": "Levels of harmful air pollutants have dropped significantly since the ultra-low emission zone was enlarged to cover Greater London last year, according to a report from city hall. Analysis covering the first six months since the Ulez expansion found that total emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from cars across London were 13% lower than projected had the scheme remained confined to inner London, while NOx from vans was 7% lower. Levels of particulate pollution in the form of PM2.5 exhaust emissions from cars in outer London are an estimated 22% lower than without the expansion. The total change was equivalent to removing 200,000 cars from the road for one year, the report said. London\u2019s air quality was continuing to improve at a faster rate than the rest of England, with the capital\u2019s pollution rapidly approaching levels seen across the country, it found. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, extended Ulez from the inner London boroughs across the whole of London in August 2023. The move was bitterly opposed by many in outer London with a number of Conservative-led councils taking legal action. The most polluting cars must normally pay a \u00a312.50 charge each day they are driven in the capital. Only a minority of cars on the road are affected, with most petrol cars under 19 years old and diesel cars under nine years old exempt. The proportion of non-compliant vehicles entering the expanded Ulez halved to less than 4% in February, compared with more than 8% detected on London\u2019s roads last June. About 90,000 fewer non-compliant vehicles were detected daily on average each day in the zone. City hall said the improvements in air quality had exceeded the targets it had set in its consultation before the policy was implemented last year. Khan said: \u201cToday\u2019s report shows that the Ulez is working even better than expected. The expansion to outer London is already having a significant effect \u2013 driving down levels of pollution, taking old polluting cars off our roads and bringing cleaner air to millions more Londoners. \u201cWe are now set to get London\u2019s air to within legal limits by 2025, 184 years earlier than previously projected.\u201d Christina Calderato, the director of strategy at TfL, said the expansion had cut 424 tonnes of NOx emissions in six months. She said: \u201cWe know that toxic air is associated with increased risks of asthma, cancer and dementia, and that it disproportionately affects poorer Londoners and those from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. \u201cWith the greatest number of deaths attributable to air pollution occurring in outer London, it\u2019s great to see these results since the Ulez was introduced London-wide.\u201d Actual levels of NOx from cars in London have fallen by 23% year on year. About nine million people live in the area now covered by Ulez. A scrappage scheme has disbursed \u00a3184m to more than 53,000 approved applications, with about 250 vehicles sent to Ukraine instead of being scrapped. Overall traffic levels have not changed, bar usual seasonal variations, according to the report. Silviya Barrett, the policy director at Campaign for Better Transport, said: To further improve the capital\u2019s air quality and reduce congestion, we now need to see fewer vehicles on the roads with ongoing investment in public transport and walking and cycling to help reduce the need to drive.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-07T16:05:50Z",
            "content": "It is less than three weeks since Jack Draper showed his fellow left-handers that the way to beat Carlos Alcaraz on grass was to trust the natural southpaw advantages and to \u201cplay without fear\u201d. Once he\u2019d conquered his doubts and let his shots flow, the British No 1 joined only seven other lefties among 32 who have tried to beat the Spaniard on the game\u2019s original playing field. Was the dip at Queen\u2019s on 20 June an aberration? In the early exchanges and more fevered surroundings of Centre Court in the fourth round of the championships, Ugo Humbert might have thought so, as his best efforts died on the racket in his left hand. But, like Draper, he believed, wholeheartedly so. It was not quite enough. Alcaraz, a 21-year-old clay-courter who has fashioned a game for every surface, soared, was brought crashing back to earth and ultimately prevailed in a mighty struggle. The defending champion has now beaten all seven lefties he\u2019s played at Wimbledon. Ominously, in the two hours and 58 minutes it took him to win 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-5, Alcaraz several times lifted his tennis from excellent to astounding \u2013 and survived a third-set pummelling and a gripping fightback in the fourth. \u201cPlaying lefties is always tricky,\u201d Alcaraz said courtside. \u201cAt Queen\u2019s, first on grass [against Draper]. Very difficult, but I just played my own game. I feel great today. I played a really high level. I just had to stay in the point, show my opponent that I\u2019m always going to be there, last ball. Now I will rest a little bit, recovering to be 100% for the next one.\u201d Left or right, the winning formula on grass invariably turns on sheer power, and there was plenty of that on show on Sunday. There was another left-hander watching from the Royal Box on day seven, Rod Laver, who once patrolled this court like a king. Would a peak Laver have confounded Alcaraz? It\u2019s fruitless conjecture \u2013 but a thought to ponder as Spain\u2019s new emperor carves his way through the draw. He and Novak Djokovic \u2013 16 years his senior \u2013 are the only slam holders left in the men\u2019s singles, and a final between them next weekend would be a fitting battle of the ages. J\u00e9r\u00e9my Chardy, Humbert\u2019s coach, felt the power of Alcaraz\u2019s game in the first round here last year, so was more than just another interested onlooker. Everyone was entranced. An errant shot almost struck a woman in the crowd, who did not spill a drop of her drink. Admirably cool. Would the Frenchman stay similarly calm under pressure from the Spaniard? It did not seem so when he cracked first, after 20 minutes. The fluidity of Alcaraz\u2019s movement through the shot is phenomenal, the power contained and unleashed as if from the barrel of a gun. And he threatens everywhere from the service line to the net, cruising in and out like a shark. In the eighth game he hit a 107mph forehand that echoed around the enclosed arena for 40-love \u2013 only to see Humbert reply in kind on the next point. However, the world No 16 could do little more than stand and watch as Alcaraz threaded thunderbolts all around him in response to take the first set in 41 minutes. It was an exhilarating onslaught. This was a different Alcaraz to the one who had to fight back from 1-2 down against Frances Tiafoe in the previous round, but Humbert was proving obdurate. Alcaraz needed a pair of aces and a slew of big shots to save four break points in the long fifth game. Humbert came at him again in the seventh, and was similarly repulsed. Now we had a fight. \u201cAs is often the case, Alcaraz finds the solutions,\u201d Tim Henman observed. A delicious slice earned him set point and, when Humbert popped a forehand just over the line at the end of a remarkable rally [during which Alcaraz slipped behind the baseline], the Spaniard was 2-0 up after an hour-and-a-half. Laver could hardly have asked for better entertainment; Chardy probably enjoyed it less. And the noble Humbert? Shattered, by the look of it \u2013 but he remained stubbornly committed and in a counter-attack that caught everyone by surprise \u2013 especially Alcaraz \u2013 broke three times to take the third set in a few ticks over half an hour. Humbert trailed by a set, but he oozed self-confidence. He knew no fear. As nerves rattled at both ends, neither player could hold until the fourth game of the fourth set, when Alcaraz rediscovered his rhythm, having dropped serve four times in a row, to lead 3-1. Victory seemed at hand, but Humbert, who paid no heed to the odds, red-lined to break back. From love-40 in the eighth game, however, Alcaraz rebuilt his crumbling serve, held through two deuce points and got back in the contest. Trailing in the service cycle, Alcaraz had to hold to stay in the set. An astonishing passing shot that whirred past Humbert forced a raised racket of appreciation from the Frenchman and we were back on an even keel of sorts at five-all. Alcaraz was now risking trademark clay-court drop shots to good effect, and opened his shoulders on the forehand, as the vigour and sharpness returned to his game under intense pressure. His vicious top-spin landed on the line and he broke to 15. Humbert call on the crowd for support, and they gave it to him, craving a fifth set \u2013 but Alcaraz upped his serve to 132mph and closed it out with a drop shot and an unreturnable serve to his opponent\u2019s backhand \u2013 a downside for lefties. It was a match to savour."

Casper Ruud, the No 8 seed in the men\u2019s event this year, has been dealing with something a little out of the ordinary: a parasite. The Norwegian was struck down by illness during his French Open semi-final last month and on Monday, after reaching the second round here for the second time in his career, he revealed the true extent of that issue. \u201cIt was a little bit unusual,\u201d said Ruud, who defeated the Australian Alex Bolt 7-6 (2), 6-4, 6-4. \u201cI took some tests and found out that I had this kind of uncommon small parasite that I had been infected with, not sure where, but the most kind of normal place where you can get infected from it is through just unclean water. \u201cIf you are unlucky, you get a drop of shower water on your lips, or most likely a vegetable, fruit or salad being washed with unclean water.

It is 10 years since Grigor Dimitrov achieved his best result at Wimbledon, beating Andy Murray, then the defending champion, to reach the semi-finals. A decade on, the 33-year-old is back in the top 10 and showed how good he still is on grass, defeating Dusan Lajovic 6-3, 6-4, 7-5, with 45 winners, including 16 aces. \u201cI wish I could have done obviously better over the years, but here I\u2019m at a place where I feel I can maybe get a step further. But I just need to look for one match at a time, to be honest.\u201d Daniil Medvedev, the fifth seed, defeated Aleksandar Kovacevic in straight sets while Frances Tiafoe, the No 29 seed, came from two sets down for the first time in his career to beat the Italian Matteo Arnaldi."

            "content": "You know it has been a long rugby union season when it feels like it kicked off in a parallel universe. Was Fin Baxter even born when Steve Borthwick\u2019s squad assembled for their first pre\u2011World Cup training camp on 12 June last year? Were those faraway August warm-up Tests some kind of tortured fever dream? No one can accuse England of not having squeezed a huge amount into the past 13 months. It has been some slog. Sometimes, we can all be guilty of sitting in the stands or on a sofa 12,000 miles away and forgetting sport is played by human beings not robots (not for another couple of years anyway). We only see the most recent snapshot rather than the whole of the moon. So if England did flag slightly in the final quarter against New Zealand, whose actual fault is that? The weary players, the coaches who keep selecting them regardless or, above all, the ludicrous quart-into-a-pint-pot demands of the global rugby calendar? To some, the answer is largely superfluous. Test rugby remains a results business and England took a host of players with them to Japan and New Zealand who never actually took the field. Sticking with Maro Itoje, who exceeded the season\u2019s supposed maximum player welfare threshold during the first Test, was not contractually essential. You reap what you sow, in this case a 2-0 series defeat to a distinctly mortal All Black side rebuilding under new management. But hang on. Cast your mind back not to England\u2019s results in the mists of summer 2023 but to the limited gameplan they were pursuing. To the booing at Twickenham after the loss to Fiji? To the dog days of the World Cup pool stages, when George Ford\u2019s drop\u2011goals and a headed \u201cassist\u201d from Joe Marler were almost the zenith of England\u2019s attacking ambition. Or even to the head-clutching defeat in Scotland less than five months ago. And then ask yourself again: have England, regardless of the series outcome, made any progress in the past year or not? Anyone with a pair of eyes or a sense of perspective, surely, would say the former. Do you really look at Immanuel Feyi-Waboso and think: same old, same old? Ditto Chandler Cunningham-South, George Martin, Alex Mitchell, Tommy Freeman and, in the first Test, George Furbank? Or watch Ollie Sleightholme skinning a startled Sevu Reece on the outside and conclude this new-age England side has already reached its ceiling? As Borthwick freely acknowledges, a couple of significant areas urgently need addressing. Tighthead prop is self-evidently one of them: someone has to hold up the crumbling edifice that is the English scrum with even the estimable Dan Cole, now 37 years old, unable to play King Louis\u2019s role in the Jungle Book for ever. More impact off the bench a la Beauden Barrett \u2013 another area of All Black superiority in an otherwise tight series \u2013 will also be close to the top of Borthwick\u2019s summer agenda. Rewind the tape, though, and, as well as Fletcher Newell destroying England\u2019s scrum with six minutes left, check out the warm, respectful handshake a clearly impressed Barrett gave Sleightholme after the game. And then wind forward again to this November when the All Blacks will be at Twickenham for the rematch. New Zealand, who have just embarked on their own savage globe-trotting schedule of 14 Tests in 21 weeks, will be up against fresher bodies in hostile conditions with the hobnailed boot on the other foot. Better, perhaps, to reserve judgment on Borthwick\u2019s England until after that and their subsequent autumn games against Australia, South Africa and Japan. Because no one would dispute that England, as previously stated in these columns, will need to transform narrow defeats into victories sooner rather than later. Four defeats in their last six Tests shows there is clear progress still to be made, even with Courtney Lawes, Owen Farrell, the Vunipolas, Ben Youngs, Danny Care et al no longer available. If someone could conjure up a way to reintegrate the French-based Jack Willis and, possibly, Henry Arundell into Borthwick\u2019s squad \u2013 both initially went into exile as a result of their English clubs going bust which makes them special cases by definition \u2013 it might also help. But if I was Borthwick I would also be stressing to his players that the 2-0 series outcome is not the only takeaway from this Test series. All it required was three extra points from almost in front of the sticks in the first Test and a penalty try in the closing moments at Eden Park and the Hillary Shield might have been England\u2019s. So if you meet a glazed-eyed red rose player gazing dejectedly into his pi\u00f1a colada in a beach somewhere this summer \u2013 or park up next to the camper van which the aforementioned Baxter is planning to drive around New Zealand in the coming weeks \u2013 be gentle with him. And dwell not on the last-quarter frustration but the excitement delivered across the Tests in New Zealand and Japan and against Ireland and France in the latter half of the Six Nations. And, once they have disappeared back to their well\u2011deserved hammocks, ponder afresh the ultimate purpose of sport. If a side reinvents itself in full public view, re-engages with thousands of previously jaundiced fans, tries its heart out from first whistle to last, is led by decent men who transparently care, and commits to learning from its mistakes, do you judge everything on what the scoreboard currently says? By how it might read in one or two years\u2019 time? Or do you simply see the crescent of an endlessly unreachable moon?"

            "date": "2024-07-05T22:02:57Z",
            "content": "Two teams who would not have scored all weekend finally found their range in the shootout but, eventually, somebody had to miss. It was harsh on Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix that his aberration, a crisp but fractionally wayward penalty that rapped Mike Maignan\u2019s right post, was decisive given he was not on the pitch for most of the fare that had preceded it. But it was fitting that this protracted, oddly absorbing tie went the distance and entirely in keeping with their performance over the past three weeks that France somehow pulled through. Th\u00e9o Hernandez ensured that, making it five successful conversions from five. As he stepped up Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, withdrawn during extra time and clearly uncomfortable from an earlier blow to his broken nose, had crouched on the touchline and wrung his hands. The entire night had been imbued with an anxious, skittish, taut quality more befitting of a final. Mbapp\u00e9 watched his teammate convert and Spain now stand between him and the real thing. Presumably the prospect of an unfulfilled tournament\u2019s work had been racing through Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s mind. He has done his best given, in his own words, the view through his mask reminds him of 3D spectacles. This affair had, once a slow-burning first half was put aside, certainly been anything but flat and examples were served up regularly of the impotence that both sides had surmounted in getting this far. The biggest reminder of all came three minutes into extra time after Francisco Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, the Portugal substitute, had scorched to the right byline and served the ball up on a plate. There was an era when its recipient, Cristiano Ronaldo, scored these in his sleep but his body shape was all wrong and he effected a rugby conversion from eight yards. Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, 18 years Ronaldo\u2019s junior, ran over to console his captain. Heaven forfend a repeat of Monday night\u2019s tears. It was the closest Ronaldo came to goal all night, save for a successfully converted penalty to open Portugal\u2019s set. An earlier free-kick, afforded him without quarrel because Bruno Fernandes had been withdrawn, was planted into the wall. There remain a subset who will not want to hear it but the fact he was still on the pitch after two hours made no sense. Persisting with Ronaldo against most available logic has become akin to drunkenly calling a former partner; little good has come of it for Roberto Mart\u00ednez and Portugal. He had attempted a first-half sprint before being shepherded away by an almost apologetic William Saliba; the rest of his contribution had amounted to the occasional lay-off in midfield and it felt unbecoming for a genuine icon of the sport, once the second-best player in the world, to remain in situ while an accomplished and mobile young forward in Gon\u00e7alo Ramos was unused. That is not a blanket comment on footballing old age. For a complete contrast witness Pepe, who at 41 put on a masterclass here. One passage of play, which came towards the end of normal time straight after the equally exceptional Saliba had made a heroic block, encapsulated him better than words ever could. The blisteringly quick Marcus Thuram had just arrived on the scene for France and blazed a trail down the wing but Pepe, brain and legs in glorious sync, kept pace over fully 60 yards and was able to avert danger. Pepe ensured his pleasure was made fully known to Thuram; advanced years have, in his case, certainly not brought docility. It was an evening to admire defensive arts far more than any of the attacking play that, while swinging from end to end like a basketball match for much of the second hour, generally ended in head-banging frustration. How to analyse two teams who, stacked with talent and so utterly accomplished in most of their movements, simply froze every time the chance came to convert? Portugal, the better side overall, will not enjoy poring over the component parts of their failure. For all Ronaldo will be under the microscope there was the moment when, with virtually the last action before penalties, the left-back Nuno Mendes shot straight at Maignan from 16 yards when a finish to either side would have sparked delirium. Maignan had earlier worked harder in denying the hugely impressive Vitinha, who should nonetheless have scored, and repelling an angled strike from Fernandes. Even F\u00e9lix, deployed midway through extra time, had time to avoid his later ignominy but headed into the side netting. Portugal had the game\u2019s best forward in Rafael Le\u00e3o but his endeavours, repeatedly tormenting Jules Kound\u00e9, came to nothing. What Mbapp\u00e9 would have given for any such opening. He was clearly not at full tilt, Jo\u00e3o Cancelo marshalling him adeptly before N\u00e9lson Semedo took on the job. That did not deter him from attempting a number of shots from around the penalty area; in his best nick at least one of them would surely have troubled Diogo Costa, who saved well from Hernandez in the opening period, but his end product was tentative. The most painful moment for Mbapp\u00e9 came when, early in the second half, he strained to defend a corner and felt the full impact of a Bernardo Silva header. Obviously in discomfort, he removed the mask and sought treatment before carrying on until his eventual removal. France, without a goal in open play from any of their own players, soothed the agony later on but will need him badly from here."

Porn also plays a big part in Project 2025: a Christian nationalist manifesto and list of desired policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation that has been described as \u201ca wishlist for a Trump presidency\u201d. (Donald Trump has said he knows nothing about it.) The 900-page plan proposes policies like mass deportations, extreme abortion restrictions and the dismantling of climate change protections. It also says that pornography should be outlawed. On the surface the conservative obsession with porn doesn\u2019t seem overly problematic. There are, after all, plenty of serious issues with the porn industry. It\u2019s often exploitative and it\u2019s helped to normalize violent acts like strangling during sex. The problem, however, is the incredibly broad way in which Project 2025 Mandate talks about porn. No definition of porn is provided; rather, it\u2019s talked about in the context of things like transgender rights and non-normative gender expression. Porn, we are told is \u201cinvading [children\u2019s] school libraries\u201d. The word has been weaponized as a useful way to attack LGBTQ+ rights. See, for example, this extract from the foreword of the Project 2025 Mandate: \u201cPornography, manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology \u2026 is as addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime. Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered.\u201d What does this mean? Well it seems to mean that the far right want to define a book that features a same-sex couple as illegal pornography and throw the author of the book and any distributors of the book in prison. It seems to mean that a book talking about sexual violence could be classified as porn and banned. It seems to mean that talking about the existence of trans people would be \u201cporn\u201d and criminalized. In short: anything that goes against normative gender roles and hierarchies, or interrogates those hierarchies, could be considered obscene and criminalized. Project 2025, it can\u2019t be stressed enough, isn\u2019t some sort of hypothetical dystopian possibility. The scariest part of all this is that it\u2019s very much under way. Republicans are already classifying anything they don\u2019t like as obscene pornography and finding ways to ban it. There\u2019s been a surge in book bans in American schools, for example. From July to December 2023, PEN America found that more than 4,300 books were removed from schools across 23 states. Many of the targeted titles feature LGBTQ+ characters. Works that address rape and sexual assault are also increasingly being targeted. So don\u2019t be fooled by Project 2025\u2019s preoccupation with porn. The far right aren\u2019t interested in the exploitation of women, they\u2019re interested in controlling exactly what it means to be a woman. This isn\u2019t a crusade against porn, it\u2019s a crusade against progress. Katy Perry is getting backlash for Woman\u2019s World, her new \u2018feminist\u2019 anthem Woman\u2019s World is Perry\u2019s first solo single in three years and, the singer explained, the first thing she\u2019s done \u201csince becoming a mother and since feeling really connected to my feminine divine\u201d.

            "date": "2024-07-02T17:02:25Z",
            "content": "Sajid Javid, the former Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, is to become a partner at a London investment firm founded by a trio of his former colleagues at Deutsche Bank. The former banker, who held seven ministerial positions in a 15-year political career, confirmed on Tuesday that he was joining Centricus, a private equity and asset manager based in Mayfair. He will start the role on 8 July. Javid has already earned about \u00a3450,000 as a consultant for the company, which has $42bn (\u00a333bn) of assets under management and invests in everything from football to luxury hotels and 3D printing. The company began paying him \u00a325,000 for up to 10 hours of work a month in March 2023, rising to \u00a350,000 a month after he doubled his hours in April this year, according to the register of members\u2019 interests. He will join Centricus as a partner after the general election, in a full-time role that will reunite him with the company\u2019s two other partners and co-founders, Nizar Al-Bassam and Dalinc Ariburnu. Javid worked alongside both men at Deutsche Bank in the years leading up to \u2013 and during \u2013 the global banking crash, before he left to enter politics in 2009. \u201cThe founders of the firm I know very well, because I used to work with them. Having left parliament and politics I was looking to go back into business and finance and Centricus is a firm I am very pleased to be joining,\u201d said Javid. \u201cI will in my own time also be carving out time to support good causes. The motivations I had to get into politics to help others have never gone.\u201d Javid served in the cabinet under three prime ministers as the minister for business, health and culture, as well as home secretary. He resigned as chancellor in February 2020 after Boris Johnson asked him to sack his advisers, and was replaced by Rishi Sunak. He rejoined Johnson\u2019s cabinet in June 2021 as health secretary but sensationally quit in July 2022, amid a wave of resignations that ultimately brought down Johnson as prime minister. Centricus says it focuses its investments in four areas, financial services, technology, infrastructure and media, consumer and entertainment. The company is perhaps best known for its work advising the $100bn Vision Fund, a partnership between Japan\u2019s SoftBank and the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund. Centricus, whose co-founder Al-Bassam holds British and Saudi citizenship according to Companies House filings, reportedly played a big role in securing investment from Riyadh. The company\u2019s third co-founder, Michele Faissola, reportedly left the firm after his connections with the Qatari government created tension with the Saudis, amid diplomatic tension between the two Gulf states. Centricus also worked with European football\u2019s governing body, Uefa, on an alternative proposal to a plan by several large football clubs to create a new Super League to rival the Champions League. The company was also involved in an ill-fated attempt to buy Chelsea FC in 2022, during a forced sale process triggered by UK imposing sanctions on the club\u2019s former owner, the Russian oligarch. Javid\u2019s consultancy work for Centricus has previously attracted the attention of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointment (Acoba), which examines the propriety of ministers taking jobs in the private sector after their service. Acoba said Javid\u2019s previous role as chancellor had afforded him \u201csignificant knowledge of fiscal and monetary policy\u201d. It said this knowledge might be \u201cperceived to offer an unfair advantage to Centricus, specifically information regarding potential at-risk firms\u201d. However, the body cleared Javid to work for Centricus. On Tuesday, Ariburnu, who donated \u00a35,000 to Javid\u2019s Bromsgrove constituency office in 2015, said the firm had \u201cbenefited greatly\u201d from Javid\u2019s advice over the past year. \u201cWe are delighted that he has agreed to join our partnership and firm on a full-time basis,\u201d said Aburnu. \u201cWe look forward to further benefiting from his in-depth understanding and experience in global markets, international business and global geo-politics to help guide and execute our firm-wide strategy.\u201d"

            "content": "The Hundred season that starts at the Oval on Tuesday will be the last in its current form, with expansion from eight teams possible and changes of ownership inevitable as the organisers launch into \u201cspeed dating\u201d with potential investors. Negotiations between the England and Wales Cricket Board, would-be investors and existing host counties and clubs are set to accelerate over the second half of the year in a process described by the ECB\u2019s Vikram Banerjee as \u201ckind of a bit like very strange speed dating\u201d that will ensure \u201cthat everyone\u2019s got a partner in a weird kind of school disco sort of moment\u201d. Potential investors have been invited to send delegations to attend games over the next four weeks, with the final scheduled for 18 August. \u201cMany of them know cricket very well, know the Hundred very well and may not feel the need to come,\u201d said Banerjee, the ECB\u2019s director of business operations. \u201cOthers, some of our American friends for example, may like the idea of what we\u2019ve got but don\u2019t really know cricket at all so they\u2019ll come along and see what English cricket\u2019s about. \u201cWe\u2019ll then start the process in earnest in September, building off the momentum that hopefully is created from the tournament, with the aim that the 2025 season becomes the first season of different. What different looks like we can\u2019t tell just yet.\u201d The ECB is selling its 49% share in each team, with investors seeking majority control of teams needing to reach a separate deal to buy some or all of the 51% stake owned by host counties. In its search for investment the ECB has met the owners of every existing Indian Premier League franchise, as well as those in control of any independent teams in the equivalent women\u2019s tournament, the WPL, and has \u201cjust sent a document and a video to some NFL owners that explains what cricket is\u201d. The ambition is for negotiations to conclude in time for the immediate future of the tournament\u2019s eight teams to be known before the player auction next March. \u201cIf things take a bit longer and the 2025 season is a bit of a transition season, which it most likely will be, then that\u2019s fine,\u201d Banerjee said. The ECB hopes to change the tournament in several ways in coming years, with one priority being to \u201cmove it more into a tribalism\u201d, creating a generation of fans that will attend every home game and travel for away fixtures, replacing the perception among some attendees that matches are little more than an interesting evening out. There are also plans to create more teams, though major structural changes \u2013 including a switch from the 100-ball format to more familiar T20s \u2013 are said to be unlikely under the The broadcasting deal with Sky and the BBC runs until 2028. \u201cWe see the need for a potential expansion of the competition at some point going forwards,\u201d said Richard Gould, the ECB chief executive officer. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly something that has been discussed over the last five or six weeks with our stakeholders. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying exactly how the expansion could and will happen at this point, because there\u2019s a lot of factors that would need to come into play on that, but there is an ambition that we would like to see the competition expand at some point.\u201d"

            "content": "The Australian National University (ANU) is launching a review into its investment portfolio, acknowledging \u201cchanging expectations\u201d in the community around deriving revenue from weapons manufacturers. It follows an announcement by the University of Sydney to hold a similar review after weeks of lobbying from pro-Palestine student encampments. The encampments, established in every state and territory, called on vice-chancellors to disclose and divest from weapons manufacturers and companies with ties to the state of Israel, accusing institutions of complicity with the war in Gaza. The camps have since been largely disbanded, with dozens of students facing disciplinary action for their participation in protest activity. \u201cRecent advocacy from our community has helped to draw attention to a lack of clarity in the policy on revenue derived from the manufacture and sale of technology with military applications,\u201d ANU\u2019s issues paper reads. \u201cThis is not an issue for ANU but across the university sector. Changing community sentiment requires new considerations for the university\u2019s investment portfolio.\u201d A spokesperson for ANU said the review had been self-initiated and would be composed of student representatives from the ANU council, staff and \u201csubject matter experts\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Freedom of information disclosures published this week show ANU refused to adopt a controversial definition of antisemitism after receiving internal advice that it would compromise academic freedom. The advice, prepared by the university\u2019s academic freedom reference group for the then vice-chancellor, Brian Schmidt, was issued amid continued lobbying from parliamentarians and some Jewish groups for universities to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u2019s (IHRA) definition. A minority of universities including the University of Melbourne, Monash University, Macquarie University and the University of Wollongong have backed it. The definition has faced global backlash among Palestinian and Arab scholars who argue its definition of antisemitism, which includes \u201ctargeting the state of Israel\u201d, could be used to shut down legitimate criticism of Israel and stifle freedom of expression. The reference group similarly warned \u201cadopting any definition of antisemitism which implicates academic criticism of the State of Israel poses a real risk of reducing the scope of academic freedom\u201d. \u201cThe \u2018safeguarding and implementation of ANU academic freedom policy\u2019 consistent with our obligations to the wellbeing of ANU staff and students would be most effectively achieved by no such change being made to that policy or any other of our existing suite of policies and procedures,\u201d the internal advice read. The documents show that prior to receiving it, Schmidt noted in an email to the head of ANU\u2019s law school, professor Anthony Connolly, that \u201ca change from the status quo would require a significant amount of consultation and consideration\u201d. A spokesperson for ANU said the discussion paper was \u201cone element\u201d on the university\u2019s consideration of the IHRA definition, which also went to a specialist working group of the academic board. \u201cAfter extensive due diligence, the university\u2019s view is that it has sufficient protections and measures in place to help prevent and respond to any form of discrimination within its existing policies and procedures,\u201d they said."

            "date": "2024-07-13T12:00:19Z",
            "content": "For a chancellor targeting a decade in power, Rachel Reeves is in a hurry. After 14 years in the wilderness for Labour, and several centuries of Britain awaiting its first female chancellor, it\u2019s not surprising she is keen to get on with the job. So far, two ideas have predominated: blaming the Conservatives for the worst economic inheritance since the second world war, and laying the foundations for national renewal at breakneck speed. Reeves says there isn\u2019t any time to waste to get Britain on track for the highest sustained levels of growth in the G7. But it is a task that will involve tough trade-offs and challenges, and will come to define Keir Starmer\u2019s government. In the scramble to look busy, ministers have been hurriedly working behind the scenes to reshape the institutions of Whitehall and get the government machine aimed at Reeves\u2019s primary objective. One quick win was the creation of a new council of economic advisers, housed within the Treasury and led by top London School of Economics academics John Van Reenen and Anna Valero. More changes are due in Wednesday\u2019s king\u2019s speech, including the government\u2019s legislative plans for workers\u2019 rights, planning reform, the NHS and Great British Energy, Ed Miliband\u2019s prized low-carbon power company. Sources say we can expect a big announcement on infrastructure, too. The government is keen to show it is committed to getting mega-projects built after the stop-start failures of the Tory years. There is a rush to finalise plans, including the potential abolition of the National Infrastructure Commission, which would be replaced with a new body. Elsewhere, Starmer is setting up \u201cdelivery boards\u201d packed with external experts for his five key \u201cmissions\u201d for government: growth, energy, crime, education and health. The challenge, though, is whether the reforms will succeed in getting Britain\u2019s economy back on track. Successive governments have carried out similar tyre changes on the Whitehall motor, only to end up with the wheels spinning on the road to prosperity. This time Labour is preparing to rely heavily on the private sector, in acknowledgment of tight constraints on the public finances. After the Tories\u2019 Brexit-era \u201cfuck business\u201d approach, there is obvious latent potential to unlock. However, the government ought to be realistic about how far this might go. For decades, the UK has trailed comparable rich nations on business investment \u2013 a fact made worse by the economic vandalism of austerity, Brexit, and the churn of Conservative prime ministers. Figures from Capital Economics show total investment in the UK has shrunk from 26% of GDP in the late 1980s to 18% today \u2013 a bigger decline than the rest of the G7. That suggests Labour is aiming to get from the bottom of the investment league table to the top: the equivalent of Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016, a 5,000-1 dream come true. Bringing about stability will help. The UK now stands as a beacon of relative calm in an increasingly volatile world. There will be further tailwinds as inflation cools, and the Bank of England is likely to cut interest rates soon. Reeves\u2019s new national wealth fund could help encourage investment in some certain parts of the economy, as part of a broader modern industrial strategy \u2013 details of which are said to be in the pipeline. However, Labour\u2019s manifesto implies cuts to public investment as a share of GDP from the current starting point, putting even more weight on the private sector to lead the charge in Britain\u2019s unlikely Leicester-inspired campaign. Unlocking more private capital could require the government to be bolder with its own investment plans. To do so without deviating from Labour\u2019s tax promises, Reeves could use the review of public spending she commissioned last week to pave the way for changes in the government\u2019s fiscal rules. The chancellor is also said to be keen to revamp the Office for Budget Responsibility, including a request for reports on the long-term impact of capital spending decisions. Currently, the Treasury watchdog publishes five-year forecasts. But this fails to capture the benefits from big infrastructure programmes, which can take longer to materialise. Such a change could help strengthen the case for investment. There is ample evidence that this might be a good idea, including from Van Reenen and Valero, who were among the authors of a report earlier this year calling for a temporary boost to public borrowing to drive investment in sustainable technologies and infrastructure. \u201c[It] would prove cost-effective and beneficial to living standards and economic competitiveness by increasing productivity and economic growth,\u201d they wrote. In the early days of Labour\u2019s putative decade in power, this could have the biggest effect on growth."

Most of the problems in her in-tray are traceable to a single cause: underfunding. Just 0.4% of public expenditure is spent on arts and culture \u2013 far below comparator nations (such as France and Germany), and the European average spend of 1%. Yet before the pandemic and the subsequent cost of living crisis devastated the creative industries, in 2018, they contributed \u00a3111.7bn to the economy. Financing the arts is an economic investment, not a subsidy. Further, placing the arts and culture sector \u201cdown the governmental pecking order\u201d is a product of outdated thinking.

            "date": "2024-07-24T22:00:29Z",
            "content": "While Kamala Harris has restored some hope for Democrats in November, the likelihood of a Trump presidency still remains very strong. And if that happens, Australia may find itself more damaged than any other major country. Seven years ago during Trump\u2019s first term, Rabobank economist Michael Every gave a presentation at a conference in Canberra that freaked the audience out. He investigated how bad things could get if Trump began a serious trade war. The worst case did not eventuate, but like a company\u2019s bad second product, a second Trump presidency looks likely to send us down a dark path that we had avoided in his first attempt. Before we get to the economy, we should note some other important issues. Last Sunday was the hottest day on record for the planet. It came off the back of June being the hottest June on record \u2013 making it 13 months in a row of records being set: If the graph does not display click here So quickly is the world warming that what used to be considered hot now looks positively chilly: If the graph does not display click here The 12 months to June 2010 were a record 1C above the 1880-1909 average \u2013 it hasn\u2019t been that cool now for nearly a decade. A Trump presidency would almost certainly ensure this keeps rising. During his deranged Republican National Convention speech, one of his biggest cheers came when he used the old line of \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d (a line the Albanese government agrees with, given it keeps opening up new gas fields). So forget emissions reductions or global agreements while he is in power. Then of course we have defence. The Albanese government for no logical reason has strapped itself into Scott Morrison\u2019s $368bn suicide vest, also known as Aukus. Spending that much money to annoy our non-English speaking neighbours and thus make Australia less safe while we wait for nuclear submarines that will never arrive (much like Dutton\u2019s nuclear power plants) is bad enough. Add in a Trump foreign policy, and Anthony Albanese should be telling the defence minister right now to get us out of this horror show. Of course, while things might get bad for Australia, given Trump has said he will act as a dictator on day one, will probably approve an abortion ban and be empowered by the supreme court to undertake whatever illegal actions he feels like, we do need to keep some perspective for how bad things will be for those in America itself. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads However, a Trump presidency would have a pretty dire economic impact on Australia. The direct hit would be a 10% tariff on all exports to the US. Trump\u2019s love of tariffs seems linked to his former economic adviser Peter Navarro\u2019s belief that imports make the economy smaller. While imports do technically reduce GDP, that\u2019s only done to avoid double counting. Every import we buy is something we consume and so if we didn\u2019t subtract imports from GDP we would count things twice, first as an import and then as a consumption item (or investment if they are capital goods). But Trump has got it into his brain that reducing imports makes the economy stronger, thus reducing imports via a tariff would make America richer \u2013 even though everyone would instantaneously have to pay 10% more for every imported good. This of course would hurt all nations that export to the US, but luckily, we are not all that reliant on the US as an export destination any more: If the graph does not display click here As we all know, most of our exports go to China. But this is where things start to get dicey for us. Because while Trump wants to put a 10% tariff on all imports, he wants a tariff of 60% for those from China. That would be pretty destructive to a Chinese economy that is already struggling. China would no doubt respond in kind, and most other nations would probably get in on the act. At this point, Michael Every\u2019s nightmare scenario of a trade war (and possible real war) would start to play out. But even if the situation remains purely economic rather than military, a report from the OECD in May found that Australia\u2019s economy would be among the ones to suffer the most. The report found that a 10% reduction of trade across all sectors between the OECD and the major non-OECD countries (which include China and India) would see Australia\u2019s GDP fall by 1.2%. That was second-worst behind South Korea.

And remember this estimate of a 1.2% drop in GDP comes when our economy is already shrinking when we exclude population growth.

Earlier this year I noted that unemployment was rising at a rate that was close to triggering what is known as the \u201cSahm rule\u201d of recessions. In March and April things steadied a bit, but the June 4.1% unemployment rate puts us on the brink of breaking the barrier that US economist Claudia Sahm argues is consistent with recessions: a 0.5 percentage point rise in unemployment over 12 months: If the graph does not display click here So no, a Trump presidency would not be good for Australia should he carry through with his tariff plan. A recession gets much more likely. Unfortunately, bad as that would be, given the dire impact of climate change and the risks that a breakdown in America\u2019s democratic institutions would pose for our own security, the worst news is a recession might be the least of our problems.

            "content": "Britain is taking its first steps towards forging closer trading links with the EU in meetings between the new business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, and international counterparts in Italy. In his first overseas visit since Labour\u2019s election landslide, Reynolds will tell a G7 meeting of trade ministers in the Italian city of Reggio Calabria that the new UK government wants to foster a \u201ccloser, more mature relationship with our friends in the EU\u201d. Aiming to reset relations after a volatile period under successive Conservative administrations since the 2016 Brexit vote, he is expected to tell international ministers that Britain is \u201cback on the world stage and \u2018open for business\u2019\u201d. Reynolds will add: \u201cWe are seeking a closer, more mature, more level-headed relationship with our friends in the European Union \u2013 our nearest and largest trading partner, and we also intend to forge better trading relationships with countries around the world.\u201d The meetings come as Keir Starmer tries to build closer links with Brussels by hosting EU leaders at Blenheim Palace near Oxford on Thursday, as part of a one-day European Political Community summit. The prime minister is attempting to walk a tightrope between strengthening EU relations while also telling voters that his government will not take Britain back into the single market or customs union. Starmer is instead relying on more modest reforms and a warmer tone with Brussels. The prime minister insisted during the election campaign that the UK would not rejoin the EU within his lifetime. Instead, Labour committed in its manifesto to building stronger trade and investment links with the 27-nation bloc, including through a veterinary agreement, support for touring artists, and mutual recognition deals for professional qualifications. The EU accounted for 41% of UK exports of goods and services and 52% of imports in 2023. Business leaders have urged Starmer to forge closer links with Brussels given the importance of the EU market to UK companies, while also calling for looser migration rules to give them more access to EU workers. Under the terms of the Brexit deal finalised by Boris Johnson\u2019s government in late December 2020, and in force since January 2021, the UK and the EU are committed to reviewing the implementation of the agreement every five years, with Starmer expected to oversee the first such process in 2026. Some commentators have suggested the review could pose an opportunity for the deal to be renegotiated. However, EU officials have argued the process may only offer limited scope for change. Reynolds is expected on Tuesday to hold his first in-person meetings with G7 counterparts since his appointment earlier this month, including with the vice-president of the EU Commission Valdis Dombrovskis and the German vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck. The new government is hoping a \u201creset\u201d of international relations will bolster Britain\u2019s status among global businesses and investors, as part of efforts to secure the highest sustained rate of economic growth in the G7. It also comes amid rising geopolitical tensions and political uncertainty elsewhere. The US president, Joe Biden, appeared last week to back Starmer\u2019s ambitions for closer EU ties, telling the prime minister in talks at the White House that this would also strengthen the transatlantic alliance with Washington."

            "content": "Fears of a China trade war erupting under a second Trump presidential term are overblown, according to bosses at Standard Chartered bank, as they suggested that the country\u2019s real estate woes were \u201clargely in the rearview mirror\u201d. While the London-headquartered bank makes most of its money in Asia, particularly in Hong Kong and Singapore, its chief executive, Bill Winters, played down the impact that increasingly strained relations between Washington and Beijing might have on the business. Winters told journalists on Tuesday that the administration of US president, Joe Biden, had already been \u201cvery hawkish on China\u201d, implementing trade restrictions and sanctions that had not exactly thawed relations with one of the world\u2019s largest economies. \u201cWhoever wins this election, Harris or Trump, is likely to continue to be hawkish on China,\u201d Winters said. Any pressure to open up China to the rest of the world will boost business for a cross-border lender like Standard Chartered, Winters added. \u201cThe more China is under pressure from international partners, the more they\u2019re inclined to open up, in order to establish China as a very substantial trade and investment player globally,\u201d Winters said. He added: \u201cSo I won\u2019t say we\u2019re not worried because tension in and of itself is bad for global sentiment and undermines business confidence to some degree. But this is not impacting our business and, you might say, quite the contrary.\u201d The comments came as the bank reported pre-tax profits of $1.6bn (\u00a31.25bn) in the second quarter, having beat the $1.5bn forecasted by analysts, thanks in part to growth across its wealth division that manages and invests money for rich clients. Official figures released earlier this month also showed that China\u2019s economy grew 4.7% in the second quarter, falling short of expectations for a 5.1% rise. Standard Chartered warned that China\u2019s growth rate was \u201cunlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels\u201d, but Winters insisted policymakers were being very deliberate in their management of a maturing economy, including a recent real estate crisis that resulted in the forced liquidation of developer Evergrande. The bank\u2019s chief financial officer, Diego De Giorgi, said it would be a \u201cfool\u2019s errand\u201d to call a bottom on the China real estate market woes. However, he believed the financial ripple effects had largely been accounted for. \u201cFrom our point of view, it\u2019s a problem that is largely in the rearview mirror,\u201d De Giorgi said. In February, the bank said it was expecting a maximum $1.2bn hit linked to its Chinese commercial real estate portfolio. \u201cWe have every confidence that China will maintain strong growth,\u201d Winters added. \u201cIt\u2019s still the the largest, or the second largest, contributor to global growth in any particular period, and we expect that will be the case in the quarters and years to come.\u201d"

            "content": "The federal government has ramped up pressure on NSW, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia to sign on to the next school funding agreement as it rushes out the blueprint for the next decade of primary and secondary education. The states, which have been holding out on reaching a deal amid calls for higher levels of commonwealth funding for public schools, will now have until September to agree to the proposed 2.5% federal increase, or keep the old agreement. The new agreement also ties school funding to targets \u2013 including Naplan results, attendance and graduation rates \u2013 but falls short of stating how or when all Australian schools will ever reach full funding levels. Flagged to come into effect from 1 January 2025 and expire at the end of 2034, the agreement has been pushed out to get the signature of the Northern Territory government, poised to enter caretaker mode on Thursday. The NT was the second jurisdiction to reach a bilateral agreement with the Albanese government in March for the commonwealth to double its Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) contribution to 40% due to their additional need, seeing all public schools reach 100% funding by 2029. The SRS, agreed to by governments as part of Gonski reforms more than a decade ago, is the minimum dollar to provide a baseline education to students. Right now, only the ACT has reached it. 98% of public schools are underfunded and the majority of private schools are overfunded. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Western Australia, which reached its own bilateral funding agreement with the commonwealth in January to see the federal government lift its funding contribution to 22.5%, will sign the agreement in the coming weeks. But the federal education minister, Jason Clare, is still working with the remaining states to secure their agreement to his current offer of a 2.5% overall increase in commonwealth funding to public schools by 2029. State governments have maintained their opposition to the WA deal, banding together to demand a 5% commonwealth funding increase, citing budgetary pressures. Clare said there were no \u201cblank cheques\u201d on offer in the next agreement. \u201cI want to invest billions into our public schools and I want to make sure that money makes a difference to the kids who really need it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Northern Territory has signed up and Western Australia is expected to be the next to sign up. The remaining states and territories have until the end of September to confirm they will sign this agreement or continue with the current funding arrangements.\u201d The agreement offers $16bn to go to public schools over the next decade, addressing \u201cequity and excellence, wellbeing for learning and engagement and a strong and sustainable workforce\u201d. The Albanese government will also introduce legislation into parliament that will scrap the current funding cap that stops the commonwealth from providing extra funding to public schools. \u201cI have made clear that the additional $16bn of funding for public schools I have put on the table will be tied to reforms,\u201d Clare said. They include early phonics and numeracy checks to identify students in need, catch-up tutoring, greater wellbeing support and rewarding teachers to work in schools that need them. The agreement also sets out targets to improve graduation and attendance rates and close the equity gap for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students; students living in regional, rural and remote locations; students with disability and students from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. By 2030, the proportion of students leaving school with a year 12 certificate is targeted to reach a record rate of 83.8%, compared with 76.3% in 2022. The proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (aged 20-24) with a year 12 or equivalent qualification is targeted to reach 96% by 2031, aligned with Closing the Gap targets. It would be a significant increase on 2021\u2019s rate of 68.4%. The proportion of students in Naplan\u2019s \u201cneeds additional support\u201d category for reading and numeracy is also targeted to reduce by 10%, with student attendance rates to reach pre-Covid levels of 91.4% by 2030. Alongside the targets, strengthened reporting and public transparency requirements have been introduced to show how taxpayer funding is being invested, with an annual report from the commonwealth and a public reporting dashboard."

            "date": "2024-07-12T11:06:10Z",
            "content": "China posted a record $99bn (\u00a376.4bn) trade surplus last month amid signs of importers bringing forward orders to beat higher tariffs on goods from the world\u2019s second biggest economy. The latest official figures from Beijing showed exports growing at their fastest rate in 15 months, while the weakness of China\u2019s domestic economy resulted in falling imports. The size of China\u2019s trade surplus was far bigger than the $85bn expected by the financial markets and comes at a time of heightened concern in developed countries about Chinese exports. Higher US tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles and other hi-tech products come into force on 1 August, while higher EU import duties on Chinese electric vehicles came into force earlier this month. Analysts said the disparity between booming exports and sluggish imports highlighted the reliance of China\u2019s economy on access to the west\u2019s affluent consumers and would put pressure on Beijing to do more to stimulate domestic demand. \u201cThis reflects the economic condition in China, with weak domestic demand and strong production capacity relying on exports,\u201d said Zhiwei Zhang, the chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. \u201cThe sustainability of strong exports is a major risk for China\u2019s economy in the second half of the year. The economy in the US is weakening. Trade conflicts are getting worse.\u201d Exports grew by 8.6% year on year in June to $308bn (\u00a3238bn) and over the first half of 2024 China\u2019s exports totalled $1.7tn, up by 3.6% year on year. Auto exports rose by 18.9% in terms of value in the first half of 2024 and by 25.3% in volume amid lower export prices. Lynn Song, the chief China economist at ING Bank, said there was likely to be a front-loading effect before auto tariffs from the EU and US came into effect, \u201cbut tariffs could lead to a slowdown in auto exports towards the end of the year\u201d. Household electronics sales climbed by 14.8% in value terms but showed even faster volume growth of 24.9%. Semiconductor exports grew by 21.6% year on year in terms of value, and by 9.5% in terms of volume. \u201cStrong semiconductor export growth shows that China\u2019s self-sufficiency push in tech and its pivot towards hi-tech manufacturing is starting to pay some dividends,\u201d Song said. Kelvin Lam, a China economist at Pantheon Macro, said there had been a pickup in Chinese exports to the US, the UK and Germany last month. \u201cExport growth of hi-tech products, mechanical and electrical items, cars, and ships is outperforming those low value-added products that China thrived on in the 1990s.\u201d"

            "content": "Rachel Reeves could quickly find around \u00a310bn a year to plug half of the fiscal hole left by the Conservatives if she were to raise taxes on soaring levels of unearned wealth, according to leading economists. New research by the independent Resolution Foundation published today finds that Britain is a country of \u201cbooming wealth\u201d but \u201cbusted wealth taxes\u201d, leaving ample potential for the chancellor of the exchequer to raise desperately needed funds by raising taxes on the richest. The report finds that levels of wealth have risen from four times the national income when Labour was last in power to six times the national income today, despite the recent rise in interest rates. But it says Britain is a country of huge \u201cwealth gaps\u201d in which a family in the top 10th of the wealth distribution has \u00a31.3m more wealth per adult than someone in the middle of the distribution. Overall, the Resolution Foundation study finds that wealth inequality is nearly twice as high as income inequality. It notes that on the eve of the pandemic, three in 10 families had less than \u00a31,000 in savings \u2013 meaning they lacked any real safety net. This was dramatically exposed during the cost of living crisis, when many families were unable to cope with rising prices and household bills. The report says that while wealth has become increasingly concentrated at the top, wealth-related taxes as a share of national income have remained low, at around just 3% of national income. Key wealth taxes \u2013 notably inheritance tax (IHT) and capital gains tax (CGT), it says \u2013 are poorly designed to tax wealth and would be ripe for reform in the Labour chancellor\u2019s first budget this autumn, helping Reeves meet her fiscal rule of having debt falling as a proportion of GDP in the last year of the parliament. The report says IHT has many generous reliefs, meaning that the very wealthy often pay a low effective rate. It argues that ending or limiting these would raise up to \u00a32bn a year while also enhancing fairness. It also argues that if capital gains tax rates were to be linked to income tax rates, this would reduce incentives for the wealthy to change how they are remunerated to avoid tax. Raising CGT rates on shares to match the rate of tax on dividends could, for instance, raise up to \u00a37.5bn a year. Together, these two moves \u2013 bringing in \u00a39.5bn a year \u2013 could help Reeves as she faces up to tough challenges on public spending. Simon Pittaway, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cFor decades, Britain has been riding the wave of a wealth boom, and one that has been only slightly deflated by the recent rise in interest rates. \u201cAs a result, wealth has increased from four times national income when Labour was last in office to six times national income today. \u201cBut too many families have missed out on this wealth boom. Over one in four people say they wouldn\u2019t be able to pay an unexpected expense of \u00a3850, highlighting that too many families lack a basic financial safety net that even moderate levels of wealth can provide. \u201cWealth taxes have failed to catch up too. \u201cModernising our wealth taxes, removing leakages and distorting behaviour could improve the efficiency of our tax system and raise vital revenue for the exchequer.\u201d Stuart Adam, senior economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: \u201cIt would certainly be possible for the government to raise a few billion pounds from reforms to capital gains tax and inheritance tax.\u201d Both taxes, he said, currently include reliefs \u201cthat are hard to justify\u201d, such as the way pensions pot are exempt from inheritance tax at death."

            "content": "Taxes are likely to rise in the Labour government\u2019s first budget, the chancellor Rachel Reeves, has said. Speaking on the News Agents podcast, Reeves declined to rule out increases in inheritance tax, capital gains tax or pensions changes. \u201cI think that we will have to increase taxes in the budget,\u201d she told the podcast, but ruled out raising national insurance, VAT or income tax. Labour\u2019s manifesto committed not to increase those three taxes during this parliament. The budget will take place on 30 October, and Reeves warned there were \u201cmore difficult decisions to come\u201d. Her words are likely to be seized on by the Conservatives who have accused Reeves of laying the ground for tax rises. In a statement to MPs on Monday, the chancellor accused the last Conservative government of leaving a \u00a322bn black hole in the public finances. She claimed Jeremy Hunt, the former chancellor, had lied to parliament and the country about the state of public spending. \u201cJeremy Hunt covered up from the House of Commons and the country the true state of the public finances. He did that knowingly and deliberately,\u201d she told Sky News on Tuesday. \u201cHe lied, and they lied during the election campaign about the state of the public finances.\u201d Hunt has strenuously denied the claims and has written to Simon Case, the cabinet secretary and head of the UK\u2019s civil service, disputing the government\u2019s assessment. Citing the \u00a322bn shortfall, Reeves scrapped a series of Conservative policies including a long-anticipated cap on social care costs, plans to build 40 hospital projects at a cost of \u00a33.7bn, and various road projects. Reeves also axed winter fuel payments to 10 million pensioners by means testing the allowance, drawing criticism from charities. The number of pensioners receiving the winter fuel payment will be reduced from 11.4 million to 1.5 million. It was also pointed out that nearly half the shortfall cited by Reeves, \u00a39.4bn, resulted from her decision to fund above-inflation public-sector pay recommendations in full and offer junior doctors a 22.3% pay rise over two years to end their strike action. Speaking to broadcasters, Reeves argued that public sector workers deserved a pay rise and were getting one equivalent to the private sector. She said the settlement offered to junior doctors would cost \u00a3350m, a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d compared with the \u00a31.7bn cost of strike action last year. She told Times Radio: \u201cIt was the former government who gave the remit to the independent pay review bodies and, extraordinarily, this year it didn\u2019t include in that remit a number for what was affordable. We didn\u2019t know that. I didn\u2019t know that until I became chancellor on the 5th of July.\u201d The government is also scrapping long-anticipated social care changes. Andrew Dilnot, who authored the proposals in 2011, said the decision was a \u201ctragedy\u201d and would further postpone much-needed change to the system. Asked by the News Agents podcast whether she agreed it was a tragedy, Reeves said: \u201cYes, it is. But this has to be laid squarely at the feet of the Conservative party, because if we hadn\u2019t have taken action, here\u2019s what would have happened. We would have had economic and financial instability in the same way that we experienced it when Liz Truss was prime minister. \u201cThe alternative was economic instability, with financial markets in turmoil, with interest rates going through the roof, with people\u2019s mortgages and rents going through the roof. I\u2019m not willing to take that risk \u2013 economic stability always has to come first.\u201d She said Wes Streeting would take forward plans to work with the health and care sector to reform social care. An HM Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cAs we said [on Monday], there will be further difficult decisions on tax and spending at the budget on 30 October. The chancellor has not committed to any tax rises not already in the manifesto and has committed to not increasing national insurance, VAT or income tax.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-14T12:00:49Z",
            "content": "Never let your opponents define the terms of a debate. All too often, Labour has allowed the Conservatives and the billionaire press to demonise the notion of \u201ctax and spend\u201d. It went to great lengths before the election to assure voters it had no such intention. Now it drives home the message: instead, our needs will be met by \u201cgrowth, growth, growth\u201d. But tax and spend is the foundation of a civilised society. Few of the changes this country requires can be achieved while adhering to the \u201ctough spending rules\u201d the new government has imposed on itself. We urgently need massive public investment in the NHS, social care, schools, environmental protection, social housing, local authorities, water, railways, the justice system and virtually all functions of government. We need a genuine levelling up, across regions and across classes. The austerity inflicted on us by the Conservatives was unnecessary and self-defeating and Labour has no good reason to sustain it. The new government insists it is ending austerity. It isn\u2019t. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) pointed out in June, Labour\u2019s plans mean that public services are \u201clikely to be seriously squeezed, facing real-terms cuts\u201d. Similarly, the Resolution Foundation has warned that, with current spending projections, the government will need to make \u00a319bn of annual cuts by 2028-29. However you dress it up, this is austerity. We are constantly told: \u201cThere\u2019s no money.\u201d But there is plenty of money. It\u2019s just not in the hands of the government. The wealth of billionaires in the UK has risen by 1,000% since 1990. The richest 1% possess more wealth than the poorest 70%. Why do they have so much? Because the state does not; they have not been sufficiently taxed. There are two reasons for taxing the rich and taxing them hard. The first is to generate revenue: this is the one everyone thinks about. But the second is even more important: to break the spiral of patrimonial wealth accumulation. Unless you stop the very rich from becoming even richer, it\u2019s not just their economic power that continues to rise, but also their political power. Democracy gives way to oligarchy, and oligarchy is intensely hostile to everything Labour governments seek to achieve, including robust public services and a strong economic safety net. When oligarchs dominate, you can kiss goodbye any notion of the public good. Last year, I tried to estimate how much it would cost to restore a viable, safe and inclusive public realm after 14 years of Tory vandalism. While my effort was very rough, the sum came to between \u00a365bn and \u00a3100bn of extra spending a year: between seven and 10 times more than Labour\u2019s total. It\u2019s a lot, although it\u2019s dwarfed by the money the previous government spent on the pandemic: between \u00a3310bn and \u00a3410bn over two years. While these sums are ambitious, and would require expanded borrowing (which Labour has foolishly ruled out) as well as taxation, there are plenty of opportunities to raise taxes on the rich. The government could, for example, replace inheritance tax with a lifetime gifts tax kicking in at \u00a3150,000, a level that would affect only wealthy people. This would increase revenue while ending a major form of tax avoidance. The government should raise capital gains taxes: it\u2019s perverse that unearned income is taxed at a lower rate than earned income. It should close the carried-interest loophole, which ensures that private equity bosses pay less tax than their cleaners: a pledge on which it already seems to be backtracking. The government could also levy a wealth tax, a luxury goods tax and a tax on second homes and holiday homes. It could make the windfall tax on fossil fuel revenues permanent. It could replace business rates with land value taxation, and council tax with a progressive property tax based on contemporary property values: both shifts would be fairer and would raise more money. But the only extra taxes the government propose are, as the IFS remarks, \u201ctrivial\u201d. By seeking to raise revenue through economic growth rather than redistribution, Labour avoids the necessary confrontation with economic power. Not only is the strategy uncertain of success (economic growth here is subject to global forces); not only does growth load even more pressure on the living planet; but this approach also fails to break the grip of the ultra-rich. Isn\u2019t this the whole damn point of a change of government, after 14 years of Tory appeasement? Unless you seek to change the structures of power and redistribute wealth, the rich will continue to harvest the lion\u2019s share of growth while using some of their money to buy the politics that expands and fortifies their dominion. Labour\u2019s fiscal policy is mirrored by its housing policy. Instead of addressing the deep problems with this dysfunctional sector, it will expand the dysfunction by deregulating the planning system. But, as an analysis by the previous government showed, even if housebuilding rose to the planned 300,000 homes a year, after 20 years (across which 6m homes would be built), prices would be reduced by only 6%. In other words, good housing would remain unaffordable to most. To make homes more accessible, you need to change the structure and incentives of the market. In our report for the Labour party in 2019, Land for the Many, a team of us showed how it could be done. While building is still required, everyone can be well housed without the need for such a massive programme. Among other measures, the government should use the tax and planning system to discourage under-occupancy, set up public development corporations to assemble land and harvest most of the uplift in its value when planning permission is granted. But this too means confronting powerful interests. As the Tories (heavily funded by property developers) and Reform (chaired until this week by a property developer) have found, it\u2019s much easier to deflect blame from the massive failures of the property industry on to immigrants. Unless the new government defies this predatory sector, it leaves the door open to the extreme right. The government\u2019s approach to raising revenue and building housing and infrastructure while keeping the structures of injustice intact might seem like a shortcut to the change it seeks. But it strengthens the hand of Labour\u2019s opponents. Some of the most effective movements in history \u2013 campaigns for both the male franchise and the female franchise, workers\u2019 rights, civil rights, gay rights \u2013 have sapped the rhetorical power of their opponents by adopting the labels thrown at them. The government should wear the \u201ctax and spend\u201d badge proudly. It must know, as we all do, that it is the only way out of this mess. George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"

            "content": "That was authentic anger, Rachel Reeves\u2019s indignation well justified as she thundered in the Commons at the inheritance she has been left. Labour is genuinely outraged at the destruction the former chancellor Jeremy Hunt deliberately inflicted, knowing his party would be out of there for years to come. They did indeed \u201cput party before country\u201d, as she said, by cutting tax without having the funds to pay for their promises. The Treasury\u2019s audit shows her victorious battlefield strewn with landmines: unfeasible commitments for Boris Johnson\u2019s fantasy 40 new hospitals, roads without budgets, every public service burned out and councils everywhere tipping into bankruptcy. This was not mere fecklessness but deliberate sabotage, an act of treason against the country. That Tory wreckage will stay vividly imprinted in the public memory. All that matters now is how to find the resources to breathe renewal and growth into the national decay all around us. The depth of the dishonesty in this year\u2019s budget meant she made tough cuts in-year: the winter fuel allowance made no sense for pensioners not on benefits. Social care charging caps, endlessly delayed, will not go ahead: the idea needs to be wrapped up in a better future reform. She will pay all public employees the raise they deserve, though this is still behind the private sector. Cutting \u00a33.2bn shared between every cabinet minister\u2019s budget looks too harsh after the starvation years: what \u201cefficiency\u201d savings could there be? But don\u2019t despair at this revelation of a worse-than-empty Treasury. Wait for Reeves\u2019s autumn budget for her path to growth. Her inbox is flooded with abundant ways to harvest money without breaking her promises on the three main taxes. Billions are suggested by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Resolution Foundation and multiple other towering authorities, and some she will follow. Let\u2019s rehearse just a few. The frontrunner is raising capital gains tax (CGT), levied on money earned in idleness from the sale of assets such as rental properties and shares, to level out the discrepancy with the far higher income tax paid on hard work. Dan Neidle, an eminent tax reformer, says Reeves is right not to announce it in advance or everyone will cash in early to avoid it. Why, the IFS\u2019s Paul Johnson asks in his book Follow the Money, is capital gains tax not due on a lifetime of shares, property or antiques, swollen in value but absolved on death? Seeing this coming, the Telegraph dubs that a \u201cdouble death duty\u201d. Don\u2019t expect them to remind their readers that capital gains is mainly about the wealthy: only 0.5% of people had a taxable capital gain last year. Reeves is already committed to stopping private equity fund managers misrepresenting their earnings as a capital gain to pay less tax than their cleaners. IFS research shows raising CGT doesn\u2019t kill off investment either. \u201cThe rich will flee!\u201d is their allies\u2019 last defence. But they are not as mobile as they pretend, with family roots that resist being dug up. Tired of London, tired of life, they fear getting very bored in these \u201cculturally barren\u201d tax havens, finds Sam Friedman, professor of sociology at the London School of Economics. His team interviewed a raft of the top one-percenters and found none planning to emigrate. The golden goose has plenty more eggs, with inheritance tax (IHT) paid by just the wealthiest 4% of estates and too easily avoided: why do pension pots, farms and family businesses escape it? It\u2019s time to charge national insurance (NI) on all income, not just on pay, including on pensions above a threshold. That\u2019s serious money. Exempting the self-employed from NI costs the Treasury \u00a35.9bn, mostly from well-off \u201cself-employed\u201d partners such as City lawyers or private medics. It\u2019s a \u201cdeceit\u201d, says Helen Miller, creator of IFS Taxlab, which checks what each tax raises. Pensions tax relief is ripe for reform: high earners get 40% and 45% relief subsidised by the state, while ordinary earners get just 20%. Reform of council tax, long overdue, would stop the richest in southern England paying less than the northern average. Tax Justice UK, with the admirable Patriotic Millionaires, urges the rich to be taxed more, suggesting \u201c10 tax reforms to raise \u00a360bn for public services and a fairer economy\u201d. Just as a thought experiment, the LSE\u2019s wealth commission shows a one-off raid on wealth above \u00a32m, charged at 1% a year for five years, would bring in \u00a380bn. So there is money. Excess wealth and income is there for the plucking, and everyone knows it: the public is ahead of Labour in calling for tax rises. YouGov finds most people expected it to happen before the election. Attitudes towards tax changed when the bankers\u2019 crash, Covid and the cost of living crisis reminded everyone how much we relied on the state. A British Social Attitudes survey found 52% in favour of higher taxes, while the Financial Fairness Tracker survey shows more than half of people are happy for spending increases on public services, even if it meant personally paying more tax. Another study found that a majority (64%) said they\u2019d be more likely to vote for a party committed to higher taxes on the wealthiest to invest in the NHS and public services. This election marked the final demise of the Thatcherite small-state era. The country now has a stronger social democratic impulse than Labour yet dares trust. As the Tories veer rightwards in their search for a new leader, watch them still promise tax cuts despite the total failure of their election bribes. The money is there for the taking. Plucking the fatter geese will please most voters, and do no economic harm to Reeves\u2019s hard-earned reputation for stability. On the contrary, finding money for productive capital investment in Labour\u2019s priorities for growth, green energy and a housebuilding bonanza is being welcomed by markets as an economic stabiliser. Her October budget will define the nature of this government by its early spending priorities. Paying underfunded public employees and the junior doctors their due is the right, and totemic, start. Raising benefits is essential, not just abolishing the two-child cap, but restoring what was stripped from families since 2020. The NHS needs \u00a338bn in this parliament, says the Health Foundation, just to keep pace with rising major illness, mainly among older people. Yet children should come first: early years and skills after 16 are the emblematic investment for any country that thinks about future life and growth. Only the budget will reveal the true character of this government, by how fairly it gets, and how well it spends, the country\u2019s money. The scandalous disarray of the last budget is a low bar to soar above. But beyond emergency repairs, we wait to know the moral nature of Labour\u2019s endeavour.

            "title": "Rachel Reeves expected to reveal \u00a320bn shortfall in public finances",
            "date": "2024-07-25T19:58:56Z",
            "content": "Rachel Reeves is expected to reveal a \u00a320bn hole in government spending for essential public services on Monday, paving the way for potential tax rises in the autumn budget. Labour sources said the blame lay with the Tory government, describing it as a \u201cshocking inheritance\u201d and accusing the former chancellor of \u201cpresiding over a black hole and still campaigning for tax cuts\u201d. They pointed to spending concerns on the asylum system, welfare, defence and prisons. However, work is still being done on the audit and the final figure of \u00a320bn could shift as officials examine the spending commitments of each department. When Reeves sets out the findings of her Treasury audit on Monday, she will also announce the date of the spending review and the budget in October. Experts expect she will be forced to announce tax changes in the budget, with options including capital gains or inheritance taxes and slashing other tax reliefs. Reeves has ruled out changes to income tax, VAT, national insurance and corporation tax \u2013 the largest revenue raisers. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, told business leaders this week that the public finances were \u201cin the worst place since the second world war\u201d. A Labour source said: \u201cOn Monday, the British public are finally going to see the true scale of the damage the Conservatives have done to the public finances. \u201cThey spent taxpayers\u2019 money like no tomorrow because they knew someone else would have to pick up the bill. It now falls to Labour to fix the foundations of our economy and that work has already begun.\u201d Economists have predicted Reeves will \u201ckitchen sink\u201d the bad news about the economy, in an expected excoriation of the previous government\u2019s record. The review is likely to conclude that existing spending plans are unsustainable and would require substantial cuts to public services, a position that economists had highlighted repeatedly before the election. Presenting her Treasury audit to the Commons on Monday, the chancellor is expected to say her review has revealed state and privatised services at risk of collapse under current plans. Further billions are also committed in schemes like compensation for victims of the infected blood scandal and of the Horizon failures at the Post Office. The Cabinet Office minister, Nick Thomas-Symonds, told the House of Commons on Thursday that final compensation payments to patients infected with contaminated blood products and bereaved partners will begin to be made by the end of this year. On Monday, Reeves will also set out the government\u2019s response to the public sector pay recommendations, which are about 3% higher than in current spending plans. Government sources have suggested she is minded to accept the independent pay bodies\u2019 recommendations in full \u2013 a symbol of a new government approach \u2013 due to the costs of provoking potential further industrial action. The former chancellor Jeremy Hunt is said to have believed that pay demands would have eaten all of the Conservative government\u2019s fiscal headroom \u2013 one of the key reasons for Rishi Sunak calling an early election as it became clear there could be no promised tax cuts. Reeves is expected to make it explicit that she believes her predecessor deliberately did not act to address the looming spending shortfall. \u201cJeremy Hunt is going to have a lot of explaining to do,\u201d said one source. She will make references to how she will address the pressures in her speech on Monday, but frame it as the first in a two-stage process that will be followed in the October budget with work kicked off by the Office for Budget Responsibility. The economist Michael Saunders, a former external member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, said the Reeves review could be used to \u201cjustify significant extra tax hikes, perhaps an extra \u00a310bn-\u00a325bn\u201d. He said in a report this week: \u201cWe suspect the Reeves review will conclude that a more realistic and sustainable outlook is likely to require a mix of higher public spending, greater headroom versus the fiscal rules and a more plausible path of fiscal tightening over the five-year forecast period. \u201cAny political costs from higher taxes could be outweighed by the scale of Labour\u2019s majority and, using the cover of the review, putting the blame on the weak fiscal position left by the previous Conservative government.\u201d Tax-raising options on offer to Reeves include generating about \u00a33bn a year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, by limiting inheritance tax relief on agricultural and business assets, bringing pension pots within inheritance tax and removing the capital gains uplift on inherited assets But the targeting of inheritance assets or pensions savings in particular is extremely contentious and is likely to draw heavy criticism from the Conservatives. As well as setting out the major gaps in public spending projections, which experts had already said were likely to require austerity-level cuts, Reeves will highlight wasted opportunities for growth, including planning and investment. The communities secretary, Angela Rayner, is expected to follow Reeves on Tuesday with Labour\u2019s proposals to change national planning rules, including new targets for local authorities and relaxing rules on building on parts of the greenbelt. Those will go out for consultation before recess with the aim of approval by the end of the autumn."

            "date": "2024-07-17T17:20:43Z",
            "content": "The co-founders of Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent venture capital firm have announced their support for Donald Trump\u2019s bid for re-election, and plan to make substantial donations to back him further. Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen, the heads of Andreessen Horowitz, commonly known as A16Z, revealed their plans in a sprawling 90-minute podcast, in which they argued that the future of \u201cAmerican innovation\u201d required a Trump victory. While their financial support is not expected to equal that of the billionaire Elon Musk, who announced plans to donate $45m a month in support of the former president, the two men are seen as intellectual centres of the burgeoning right wing of the American tech scene. In a blogpost published in June, they argued that \u201cbad government policies are now the #1 threat to little tech\u201d; the startups they see as the engine of the US economy. They expressed concern about over-regulation, particularly of cryptocurrency, and proposals to tax unrealised capital gains, as well as criticising the US government\u2019s failure to use its buying power to back startups over incumbents \u201cin critical sectors like defense and intelligence\u201d. But in the blogpost, they fell short of actively backing either candidate. Now, they say, that has changed. \u201cIt\u2019s clear now that, at least on little tech \u2013 we\u2019re not experts on all things that the government does but on startups and technology we\u2019re certainly among the best experts in the world \u2013 we think Donald Trump is a better choice than Joe Biden,\u201d Horowitz said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a lot of friends who are pissed off at me for saying anything nice about President Trump \u2026 I wish it wasn\u2019t this way and we didn\u2019t have to pick a side.\u201d Andreessen specifically highlighted Trump\u2019s support of cryptocurrencies as a reason for supporting his re-election in November. \u201cIt\u2019s a flat-out endorsement of the entire space, a complete across-the-board uniform embrace of the entire thing. It\u2019s just an absolute 180 from what we\u2019ve been experiencing \u2026 this has been a brutal assault on a nascent industry that I\u2019ve never experienced before.\u201d The pair have been laying the ground for the announcement for a while. In December, Horowitz wrote: \u201cWe are non-partisan, one-issue voters: if a candidate supports an optimistic technology-enabled future, we are for them. If they want to choke off important technologies, we are against them.\u201d Already, Andreessen and Horowitz, individually and through the venture capital firm they co-founded, have donated more than $24m in this election, but the majority has gone to a non-partisan campaign, Fairshake, aiming to back or oppose candidates based on their views on cryptocurrency. Fairshake is the second best-funded Super Pac in the race so far, having raised just under the Trump-backing Make America Great Again Super Pac. A16Z was founded in 2009 and has backed a string of high-profile tech companies including Facebook, Instagram and Airbnb. According to data from Follow the Crypto, cryptocurrency-focused political action committees have raised more than $187m for the 2024 US election and spent $38m of that. The funds have overwhelmingly gone to support Republicans and oppose Democrats, although some of that spending is in primary campaigns where the opponents are of the same party. The crypto campaign has already claimed a political scalp, spending $10m to oppose the leftwing congresswoman Katie Porter in her attempt to become a Democratic candidate for the US Senate in California."

            "date": "2024-07-31T19:05:07Z",
            "content": "A group of more than 100 Silicon Valley investors, including Mark Cuban, the TV host and NBA owner, and Reed Hastings, a co-founder of LinkedIn, launched a website in support of Kamala Harris. A statement said vcsforkamala.org expressed support for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee from \u201cventure capital investors, founders and tech leaders who pledge to vote for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election\u201d. It added: \u201cWe spend our days looking for, investing in and supporting entrepreneurs who are building the future. We are pro-business, pro-American dream, pro-entrepreneurship, and pro-technological progress.\u201d The statement did not name the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, or running mate JD Vance. But it pointed to Democratic concerns about the former US president\u2019s and the Ohio senator\u2019s authoritarian impulses on issues including immigration, crime and reproductive rights, and what a second Trump presidency might do to the US\u2019s standing in the world. \u201cWe also believe in democracy as the backbone of our nation,\u201d the investors said. \u201cWe believe that strong, trustworthy institutions are a feature, not a bug, and that our industry \u2013 and every other industry \u2013 would collapse without them. \u201cThat is what\u2019s at stake in this election. Everything else, we can solve through constructive dialogue with political leaders and institutions willing to talk to us.\u201d It is a little more than a week since Joe Biden withdrew from his re-election campaign after a disastrous debate against Trump fueled concerns that at 81, he was too old to effectively run and serve. Since then Harris, 59, has transformed the presidential race, driving $200m in fundraising with eye-catching big name endorsements including those of Mark Hamill, best known as Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars movie saga, and Jeff Bridges, aka Jeffrey \u201cThe Dude\u201d Lebowski. The arrival of VCs for Kamala also pointed to growing rifts among the giants of Silicon Valley, where Vance worked for Peter Thiel, a leading donor to Republicans and propagator of \u201cnew right\u201d political thought notable for its authoritarian bent. VCs for Kamala followed Tech for Kamala, an open letter seeking contributions and orchestrated by \u201ctechnology leaders and innovators\u201d. The Tech for Kamala letter said: \u201cWe acknowledge there are a few people in tech with very loud microphones who support a very different vision of the future. But as the names on this letter show, they do not at all represent the entire tech community. \u201cIn Vice-President Harris, we choose the future over the past, stability over chaos, a hopeful America with expanded opportunity over an extreme agenda that drags us backward.\u201d On Wednesday, Leslie Feinzaig, founder of the venture capital firm Graham &amp; Walker and a lead organiser of VCs for Kamala, told the New York Times that rightwing, pro-Trump tech moguls such as Thiel, David Sacks and Elon Musk \u201cdon\u2019t speak for me\u201d. \u201cThey don\u2019t speak for most of us,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t speak for the founders.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-30T02:47:43Z",
            "content": "Indonesian President Joko Widodo has begun working from the presidential palace in the country\u2019s ambitious new administrative capital, the flagship project of his two terms in office but which has been plagued by delays. The capital is due to move from traffic-clogged and sinking Jakarta to the planned city of Nusantara in East Kalimantan province on Borneo, but the $33bn project announced in 2019 is months \u2013 even years \u2013 behind schedule. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep well \u2026 maybe because it was my first time,\u201d Jokowi, as the president is known, told reporters after his first night in the palace on Monday. The palace is 90% complete and Jokowi said that thousands of workers were still on site. \u201cThey still clean and furnish it. Everything is in good progress,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no problem with the water and electricity \u2026 The internet also works well.\u201d It was not clear how long he planned to work there. Nusantara is scheduled to hold its first ever Indonesia Independence Day celebration on 17 August, which is also expected to be the official transfer of the capital city from Jakarta, about 1,200 km (750 miles) away. Its relocation plan has come into question, however, amid slow construction progress and missed deadlines, forcing the resignations of the head of the Nusantara Capital Authority and his deputy last month. Most of the new city\u2019s buildings are unfinished, with several ministry buildings only with their lower floors usable. Delays have also affected plans to relocate 12,000 civil servants to Nusantara starting from July. Administrative and bureaucratic reform minister Abdullah Azwar Anas has said the relocation timeline will be adjusted according to \u201cinfrastructure readiness\u201d. Earlier this month Jokowi said Nusantara would be about 15% complete by Independence Day, but the whole city is not expected to be complete until 2045. Widodo\u2019s administration has relied heavily on private investment to build the city, with the state only shouldering 20% of the cost, mainly covering the construction of basic infrastructure, buildings, and utilities within the \u201ccore area\u201d of the government. In a bid to lure investment, earlier this month Widodo signed a presidential regulation that grants investors certain rights, including land rights of up to 190 years in the future capital. Public works and housing minister Basuki Hadimuljono said the government was still working to procure another 40 megawatts to power the city, but the current capacity of 10 megawatts produced by a solar power plant has been established in Nusantara. A nearby reservoir provides \u201cmore than enough to meet the needs\u201d for clean drinking water in the new city, he said. Despite the progress made, questions still remain as to when the new capital will officially be relocated as Widodo is yet to issue the official decree. Until the decree is signed, Jakarta remains the country\u2019s capital. Widodo has signalled that the decree might be issued by president-elect Prabowo Subianto, who will be inaugurated on 20 October. The delay in formalising the decree has raised questions about the location of the presidential inauguration, as in accordance with the Indonesian constitution, the swearing into office must take place in the nation\u2019s capital. The lack of investors in the megaproject also puts Prabowo in a difficult position once he is sworn in. Promising continuity as his campaign platform during the presidential election, Prabowo has pledged to resume Widodo\u2019s landmark projects, including Nusantara. Sulfikar Amir, an associate professor of science, technology, and society at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, has questioned the speed at which the ambitious project has been implemented, saying the rush has significantly affected the project\u2019s financing and planning. \u201cWho wants to work in the middle of the forest with [a] lack of infrastructure?\u201d he said.

            "date": "2024-07-31T15:00:24Z",
            "content": "Adelaide homes may soon be more expensive than Melbourne, with property prices falling in the Victorian capital for the fourth month in a row while prices in Adelaide continue to climb. Melbourne homes are now worth 4.4% less than they were at their peak in 2022, and fell 0.21% in July, according to PropTrack\u2019s latest report. The ongoing slump for the Victorian city in July \u2013 attributed to more property listings and higher construction rates \u2013 was in stark contrast to other capital cities, with Perth, Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney and Canberra all showing growth. Perth\u2019s property market has seen the strongest annual growth, with a 22.77% increase this year, up 72.2% on March 2020 and the onset of the pandemic. Prices in Adelaide have risen by 14.81% over the year and 0.58% in July, with the median value of a dwelling in the South Australian capital currently sitting at $770,000. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup PropTrack senior economist Paul Ryan said: \u201cThe relative affordability across the city has made Adelaide the strongest performing market since the onset of the pandemic. But ongoing price growth means values may eclipse Melbourne over the coming year.\u201d The median value of a Melbourne dwelling was $803,000 in July. Despite the slow decline in the last quarter and more, it was still 15.8% above March 2020. Hobart has seen a steeper decline, with prices down 2.1% over the past year and 9.4% lower than its peak in 2022. But this should be seen against the fact that \u201cHobart entered the pandemic as the strongest performing market, with values up a significant 43% over the past five years\u201d, Ryan said. In Sydney, home prices increased 0.12% in July, up 6.1% over the year, with growth strongest in the inner south-west and south-west of the city. Nationally, PropTrack reported home prices were 6.3% higher than they were this time last year, and overall increased 0.08% in July. CoreLogic\u2019s quarterly home value index, also released on Thursday, said that while housing market growth remained positive, \u201cit is clear momentum is leaving the cycle and conditions are becoming more diverse\u201d. CoreLogic\u2019s research director, Tim Lawless, said supply was the driving factor in the difference across the cities. \u201cThe number of homes for sale in Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth is more than 30% below average for this time of the year, while weaker markets like Melbourne and Hobart are recording advertised supply well above average levels,\u201d Lawless said. Buyers were orienting mainly towards lower-cost dwellings due to reduced borrowing capacity and affordability, and units were rising faster than houses across most of the capitals. \u201cMost cities now have a median house value that is at least 1.5 times higher than the median unit value,\u201d Lawless said. \u201cWith stretched housing affordability, lower borrowing capacity and a lift in both investor and first-home buyer activity, it\u2019s not surprising to see the unit sector outperforming for a change.\u201d The increasingly patchy market comes as housing approvals hit their lowest level in 12 years. The Australian Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday cited high interest rates and rising labour and material costs as key factors behind approval rates in the year to June, being down 8.5% on the previous year and at the lowest level since 2011-12."

Late on Tuesday, EY \u2013 formerly known as Ernst &amp; Young \u2013 announced it had been appointed as administrators of the company, and that the airline\u2019s Boeing 737 operations between capital cities such as Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane had been grounded, with Virgin Australia stepping in to offer impacted passengers rebooking \u201cfree of charge\u201d. Rex\u2019s regional operations with its Saab 340 turboprop planes remained unaffected by the administration and would continue to operate. The administrators said Rex and Virgin Australia were also exploring opportunities to support regional customers, including by having Virgin Australia sell Rex\u2019s regional services through codeshare or interline arrangements, and making Velocity Frequent Flyer benefits available to Rex\u2019s regional customers. Earlier on Tuesday, the federal transport minister, Catherine King, said her department had held \u201csignificant discussions\u201d with Rex\u2019s leadership after the airline on Monday requested a trading halt ahead of a significant announcement to the market. That announcement had been due by Wednesday morning. King, speaking from the site of the future western Sydney airport, said the government would wait for Rex\u2019s announcement to the ASX which was understood to be in response to a report in the Australian newspaper that the airline had appointed consultants from Deloitte to advise how it could turn around its financial woes. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait for Rex to make an announcement \u2026 but can I say very, very clearly, the government is in no doubt about the importance of regional aviation and Rex to regional aviation,\u201d King said. \u201cWe will work with Rex, we want to make sure that they have a future as part of aviation in this country, and we\u2019re very determined to make sure that happens. We obviously don\u2019t want to do that at any cost, we want to be involved very closely in what that future might look like.\u201d Rural mayors across Australia whose communities rely on Rex for connectivity warned of further isolation if the carrier went under, while leaders of larger regional centres feared airfare price hikes from Qantas if the routes were left without competition. \u201cThey\u2019re crucial \u2013 this is our highway,\u201d the Devonport mayor, Alison Jarman, said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The airline\u2019s board \u2013 which has been rocked by tensions in recent months \u2013 was scheduled to meet on Tuesday evening, amid a report from 10 News that airline staff had been locked out of hotels and company Uber accounts. Rex on Tuesday afternoon was not taking bookings for its jet services between capital cities such as Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Regional services could still be booked at that time. The airline on Monday requested a trading halt following the weekend news story it had engaged Deloitte. Bloomberg first reported on Tuesday that Rex was set to appoint EY as administrators. Bridget McKenzie, the opposition transport spokesperson, was cautious about the government\u2019s intention to help Rex, noting revelations in Guardian Australia on Tuesday that King had known about Bonza\u2019s financial instability 10 days before it entered administration but turned down the budget carrier\u2019s plea for financial help. McKenzie blamed the government for failing to help smaller airlines compete with Qantas, which Rex had recently tried to do with flights between capital cities. \u201cAs soon as Rex made the announcement they were going to tackle the big boys, take them on on that golden triangle and those capital city routes, Qantas all of a sudden took retribution on marginal regional routes. [Qantas] lost money, a bit like $1 milk for supermarkets \u2026 to actually damage Rex\u2019s financial position,\u201d McKenzie told ABC TV. The federal Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the prime minister \u201cshould consider just buying Rex\u201d. \u201cTransport is an essential service, so why not protect people who rely on regional services by bringing this critical airline into public hands?\u201d Bandt said. On Monday, the Australian stock exchange announced it had suspended trade in Rex\u2019s shares at the airline\u2019s request \u201cpending it releasing an announcement\u201d. Rex said the trading halt came ahead of an announcement \u201cin relation to a news article published on Saturday\u201d. The competition watchdog\u2019s most recent domestic airline monitoring report stated Rex had a 5% market share in March. At the same time, now-collapsed budget carrier Bonza held 2%. Rex recorded the lowest cancellation rate in March at 0.8% compared with Qantas at 3.8%. Rex in February reported a loss of $3.2m for the first half of the 2023-24 financial year, compared with a $16.5m loss in the previous six months. It said escalating costs, particularly for fuel, made it hard to predict full-year profitability. Rex was initially called Regional Express following its formation after the death of Ansett. Rex has mostly been a regional carrier, operating 36-seater Saab 340 turboprop aircraft. However, in 2020, Rex began vying for a share of the lucrative market between capital cities, seizing on the instability in Australia\u2019s domestic aviation market which occurred when Virgin Australia entered administration and underwent a significant restructuring. Rex leased Boeing 737 jets, including several formerly flown by Virgin, and launched routes between Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. However, it has struggled with numerous issues, including allegations of anti-competitive behaviour by Qantas, and difficulty accessing strategically important Sydney airport slots at peak times \u2013 a gripe echoed by Bonza. Rex has also confronted a shortage of parts to repair its ageing fleet of Saab 340 aircraft for its core regional operations, which have also been hampered by a shortage of pilots for the smaller planes. Rex shares have halved in value over the past 12 months and were trading at 56.5 cents before being suspended this week. Sources say the drop concerned PAG Asia Capital, the private equity firm that funded Rex\u2019s expansion into capital city routes to the tune of $150m. Rex has also been rocked by leadership tensions, with major shareholder and former executive chair Lim Kim Hai ousted in June. Lim was replaced by John Sharp who had been deputy chair of the board. Sharp, a former Nationals federal transport minister, has in recent years made headlines with his criticism of Qantas and aviation policy. Lim has since pushed to remove Sharp and three other directors from the board, with a special shareholder meeting due to vote on Lim\u2019s demands. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said on Tuesday he would consider proposals to save the company but added Rex already received substantial public funding with \u201cno conditions attached\u201d. \u201cOne of the things I expressed concern about was having no conditions so Rex, for example, moved away from their traditional role of being a regional airline into flights, for example, from Sydney to Melbourne,\u201d Albanese said. - Additional reporting by Daisy Dumas"

            "date": "2024-07-05T09:22:11Z",
            "content": "Before he went to Northumbria University, Harvey Burn didn\u2019t really think he was cut out for university. \u201cI got in to study sports management through Clearing but didn\u2019t really see myself sticking at it. I thought I\u2019d do a year and then probably leave. But then I joined some sports clubs and those really carried me through \u2013 to the point where I stayed on to do a master\u2019s.\u201d Now fully converted to the university experience, Burn has a master\u2019s degree in international sports management and is vice-president of sport at Northumbria University students\u2019 union. \u201cWhen you start, you might only meet the people in your halls of residence or on your course, and you can feel a bit isolated,\u201d says Burn. And while you might hit it off, don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t. \u201cJoining a club or society helps you find other people with a common interest, and the chances are you\u2019ll get on better with them than with anyone else.\u201d The fact is that while university is the place you go to get a degree, it\u2019s also where you can meet and mingle with different people from all over the world, and indulge every hobby or interest you can think of. \u201cThere really is something for everyone,\u201d says Isla Symons, who joined the netball club when she started her degree in ocean exploration and surveying at the University of Plymouth. \u201cWe have more than 50 sports on offer and 100 societies \u2013 we\u2019ve even got a Taylor Swift society. Finding something you enjoy outside your studies is so beneficial. For me, being part of the netball team became the highlight of my university experience. It was a lovely way to have a breather from my course, and it took my uni experience to another level.\u201d There really is something for everyone \u2026 The sporty student Sports clubs are a campus staple \u2013 providing an outlet for competition, fitness, training and fun for thousands of students. And the good news is that whether you\u2019re a beginner or a pro, there\u2019ll be a level to suit you. At Northumbria University, for example, they have \u201cjust try\u201d sessions where you can give a new sport a go for six weeks. Alternatively, you can join in on a \u201cjust play\u201d basis, which is less competitive and entirely free. \u201cWhatever your standard, there\u2019s a place for you,\u201d says Burn. At the other end of the scale, most universities have intramural leagues, cup competitions and tournaments, plus opportunities to travel and compete for the elite teams. And with sport comes a major social scene \u2013 though don\u2019t be put off if drinking games and strawpedos aren\u2019t your thing. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing lots of clubs and societies offer sober socials, too, so that everyone feels included,\u201d says Burn. The political animal Whatever your leanings, there are political societies to help sharpen your debating skills, develop your campaigning style and put your activist streak to good use. Many host visiting speakers and hold regular debating competitions, and with students from all over the world, you\u2019ll be able to meet and mobilise around the geopolitical issues that matter to you most. The entrepreneur If you\u2019re itching to get your business career under way, look for societies that revolve around entrepreneurship and investment \u2013 some even have stocks and shares societies, so you can learn to speculate in the company of other tycoons-in-training. There are also several student competitions every year, such as the Santander X Entrepreneurship Awards, that offer undergrads a chance to pitch their business ideas and secure equity-free funding. The bookworm Every academic department will have a society for students wanting to deepen their understanding of their subject and mix with like-minded enthusiasts. \u201cOur MedSoc [for medicine students] has more than 400 members \u2013 it\u2019s one of the biggest,\u201d says Symons, who is vice-president of activities at the University of Plymouth students\u2019 union. Joining gives you a chance to meet students from other years, which can be particularly handy if you need a buddy to help you with some aspect of the coursework. And it\u2019s great to leave uni with a readymade network of friends and contacts who might share similar career plans. The niche enthusiast Obsessed with K-pop? Mad about Nintendo Switch? Looking for fellow bubble tea lovers? Then we\u2019re almost certain you\u2019re not alone. University is an unparalleled opportunity to meet fellow enthusiasts and, if there isn\u2019t already a society to match your interest, you can start your own. \u201cWe had two new societies this year \u2013 darts and ice skating \u2013 and ice skating has quickly become one of our largest groups,\u201d says Burn. \u201cYou only need five other interested students to start up.\u201d The stage star Regardless of what you\u2019re studying, having a creative outlet is good for the mind, body and spirit. Most universities offer a range of societies that span musical theatre, acting, dance and comedy, whether you want to follow in the footsteps of comedians Ed Gamble and Nish Kumar, who met at Durham University, or handle the stagecraft and technical side. The volunteer All universities have raise-and-give groups focused around altruism and local volunteering, but there are also schemes that offer students the opportunity to travel abroad. \u201cAt Northumbria, every year, four students get to spend eight weeks in Zambia over the summer, developing sporting opportunities for communities,\u201d says Burn. Other universities have their own international volunteer projects, focused around wildlife, community building or environmentalism. \u201cUniversity is a great opportunity to push yourself outside your comfort zone and try something new,\u201d says Symons. \u201cJoining a club or signing up to a trip gives you experiences that will stay with you your whole life.\u201d For more guidance on the right course for you, check out the Guardian university league tables for 2024.

            "title": "The rich were led to believe they were different. Those days are numbered | Will Hutton",
            "date": "2024-07-14T08:30:44Z",
            "content": "\u2018Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me,\u201d wrote F Scott Fitzgerald in 1925. \u201cThey think, deep in their hearts, that they are better than we are because we had to discover the compensations and refuges of life for ourselves. Even when they enter deep into our world or sink below us, they still think that they are better than we are. They are different.\u201d The delusions of entitlement \u2013 that the rich deserve their wealth, privilege and the right to transgress social mores as they choose \u2013 are ever-present. In their eyes, wealth can\u2019t just be a by-product of luck, can it? It must, one way or another, be deserved. Among the great deformations of the four neoliberal decades through which we have lived are not just the policy catastrophes \u2013 monetarism, financial deregulation, austerity, Brexit, the Truss budget \u2013 but also the way that wealth generation and entrepreneurship, so crucial to the capitalist economy, have been ideologically framed. Instead of being recognised as a profoundly social process \u2013 in which great universities, the financial ecosystem and the runway provided by large and sophisticated markets support entrepreneurship \u2013 enterprise, and the wealth it produces, has been characterised as wholly attributable to individual derring-do in which luck plays little part. Hence the obsession with shrinking the state to reduce \u201cburdensome\u201d tax. Individual agency is part of the story but, as Warren Buffett acknowledges, so does the \u201covarian lottery\u201d \u2013 being born in the US where its system favours the skills he possesses. One of the richest men in the world believes in capital gains and inheritance taxes \u2013 and paying them. Riches are a privilege: taxing them to contribute a fair share to society\u2019s wider health \u2013 from which the rich benefit too \u2013 is the obligation that comes with being privileged. But decades of being congratulated and indulged for the relentless pursuit of their own self-interest has turned the heads of too many of our successful rich. They really believe that they are different: that they owe little to the society from which they have sprung and in which they trade, that taxes are for little people. We are lucky to have them, and, if anything, owe them a favour. There is a long list of challenges confronting the new Labour government but one of the most overlooked is the need to start challenging this narrative. The initial skirmishes foretell what lies ahead. A number of cabinet members told me that, in the months before the election, the fiercest and most consistent private lobbying of shadow ministers was to reverse Labour\u2019s commitment to suspending VAT relief on private schools. Education should not be taxed as a matter of principle, they were told. State schools would suffer a vast influx of former private school kids putting intolerable pressure on the state system; it was a tax on aspiration; it represented social engineering and class envy. The proponents were oblivious to the notion that Britain\u2019s private school system is itself a gigantic exercise in social engineering \u2013 sophisticated queue-jumping on a mass scale \u2013 that offers additional privilege to the already privileged. To sustain this advantage when the state system was in dire need was outrageous. Indeed, advocacy for private schools is itself class war. A largely state-educated cabinet so far has held the line. The relief will go. Similarly, we are warned of an exodus of the non-domiciled rich as their tax privileges are removed. So far, Labour is holding the line \u2013 the cash is too desperately needed. But, while the attacks mount it needs the strongest possible story about why it is reasonable that the rich should pay their proper dues. This has to have a moral dimension. Keir Starmer has made much of the duty that elected MPs and officials have to serve \u2013 but service and duty are not confined to those in the public realm. If Britain is to lift and sustain its growth rate decisively above the grim forecasts of little more than 1% next year and afterwards, the country will have to start looking and feeling more like a development state in which everyone puts their shoulder to the collective wheel \u2013 the rich included. We are all \u201cfellows\u201d in this common endeavour. President John F Kennedy\u2019s inaugural address asked his citizens not to think of what their country could do for them, more what they could do for their country. Britain needs that spirit now. There are encouraging straws in the wind. The Confederation of British Industry, our leading business lobby organisation, nearly driven to extinction by ethical lapses, believes that its path to recovery has been greatly helped by the advice of Principia Advisory \u2013 a consultancy that conducts ethics audits informed by the moral philosophers Jeremy Bentham, Immanuel Kant and Aristotle. Entrepreneur Julian Richer\u2019s Good Business Charter is attracting growing adherents. At the launch of the National Wealth Fund last week, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was accompanied by business leaders who believe that delivering a great purpose should be at the heart of their business. Research reveals that most fast-growing tech businesses are typically driven by such commitments to a great purpose. One new secretary of state told me that a phone call to business leaders who don\u2019t recognise trade unions brought immediate change. The appointment of James Timpson, standing down as CEO of the eponymous shoe repair and key-cutting business to take the job of prisons minister, was inspired: one in 10 Timpson employees are ex-offenders, a tribute to the family firm\u2019s longstanding belief that its societal obligation is to play its part in prisoner rehabilitation. But decades of wrong thinking won\u2019t die easily. Too many have bought into the lazy Trussite syllogism that low taxes for the rich means more enterprise and growth \u2013 backed up by an unregulated lobbying industry that is the third largest in the world. Growing a great business in the teeth of intense international competition is tough. For that to happen, the rich and enterprising must stop believing they are different \u2013 and lead the change by putting their shoulders to the shared task. Growth is best achieved as a collective endeavour. It is a civilisational moment \u2013 and Labour needs to develop the language of fellowship, obligation and common good that pitches it in those terms. \u2022 Will Hutton is an Observer columnist"

            "date": "2024-07-31T19:05:07Z",
            "content": "A group of more than 100 Silicon Valley investors, including Mark Cuban, the TV host and NBA owner, and Reed Hastings, a co-founder of LinkedIn, launched a website in support of Kamala Harris. A statement said vcsforkamala.org expressed support for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee from \u201cventure capital investors, founders and tech leaders who pledge to vote for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election\u201d. It added: \u201cWe spend our days looking for, investing in and supporting entrepreneurs who are building the future. We are pro-business, pro-American dream, pro-entrepreneurship, and pro-technological progress.\u201d The statement did not name the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, or running mate JD Vance. But it pointed to Democratic concerns about the former US president\u2019s and the Ohio senator\u2019s authoritarian impulses on issues including immigration, crime and reproductive rights, and what a second Trump presidency might do to the US\u2019s standing in the world. \u201cWe also believe in democracy as the backbone of our nation,\u201d the investors said. \u201cWe believe that strong, trustworthy institutions are a feature, not a bug, and that our industry \u2013 and every other industry \u2013 would collapse without them. \u201cThat is what\u2019s at stake in this election. Everything else, we can solve through constructive dialogue with political leaders and institutions willing to talk to us.\u201d It is a little more than a week since Joe Biden withdrew from his re-election campaign after a disastrous debate against Trump fueled concerns that at 81, he was too old to effectively run and serve. Since then Harris, 59, has transformed the presidential race, driving $200m in fundraising with eye-catching big name endorsements including those of Mark Hamill, best known as Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars movie saga, and Jeff Bridges, aka Jeffrey \u201cThe Dude\u201d Lebowski. The arrival of VCs for Kamala also pointed to growing rifts among the giants of Silicon Valley, where Vance worked for Peter Thiel, a leading donor to Republicans and propagator of \u201cnew right\u201d political thought notable for its authoritarian bent. VCs for Kamala followed Tech for Kamala, an open letter seeking contributions and orchestrated by \u201ctechnology leaders and innovators\u201d. The Tech for Kamala letter said: \u201cWe acknowledge there are a few people in tech with very loud microphones who support a very different vision of the future. But as the names on this letter show, they do not at all represent the entire tech community. \u201cIn Vice-President Harris, we choose the future over the past, stability over chaos, a hopeful America with expanded opportunity over an extreme agenda that drags us backward.\u201d On Wednesday, Leslie Feinzaig, founder of the venture capital firm Graham &amp; Walker and a lead organiser of VCs for Kamala, told the New York Times that rightwing, pro-Trump tech moguls such as Thiel, David Sacks and Elon Musk \u201cdon\u2019t speak for me\u201d. \u201cThey don\u2019t speak for most of us,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t speak for the founders.\u201d"

            "title": "Broad beans could be the cure to Britain\u2019s blues, says Cambridge research scientist",
            "date": "2024-07-28T08:00:49Z",
            "content": "Nadia Mohd-Radzman is a botanist on a mission. The Cambridge University researcher wants the UK to recognise the wonders of a crop that she believes could transform the nation\u2019s health. Hence her campaigning \u2013 for the broad bean. Vicia faba has a host of special properties, she argues. It is rich in protein, fibre and iron, for example. More importantly, it contains chemicals that are linked to lasting improvements in the moods and emotions in those who consume them, Mohd-Radzman told the Observer. For these reasons, Britain should recognise the worth of a legume that has been ignored for too long, claims the scientist, who has just launched a campaign to boost the British broad bean. This will include moves to improve its varieties, the publishing of recipes for making the bean more appetising and the organising of lectures and demonstrations to outline the benefits of an unfairly underappreciated crop. \u201cThe broad bean could do so much good for people in this country if they could be persuaded to eat it,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that is my mission. To get the country to love the broad bean.\u201d Broad beans were first grown in the Middle East but have been cultivated in Britain since the iron age. About 740,000 tonnes are harvested each year from about 170,000 hectares of UK land. \u201cHowever a great deal of that crop is used for animal feed, with much of the rest being exported to Egypt, where it is used, instead of chickpeas, to make falafels,\u201d added Mohd-Radzman, a researcher at the Sainsbury laboratory, Cambridge. \u201cWe should be using it ourselves.\u201d Nor is Mohd-Radzman\u2019s broad bean campaign the only bid to get Britons to eat more Vicia faba. Scientists at Reading University recently proposed that Britain should switch to eating bread made with it because the end product would be more sustainable and would also make it easy to deliver key nutrients to people. However, it is the ingredient levodopa, or L-dopa, which is of special interest to Mohd-Radzman, who also works at the Entrepreneurship Lab of King\u2019s College Cambridge. It is used in the clinical treatment of people with Parkinson\u2019s \u2013 and broad beans contain high levels of the compound. \u201cThe crucial point is that L-dopa has been shown to be very effective in treating the condition known as anhedonia, which essentially is the inability to feel or experience pleasure. And that is why I believe the broad bean is important. \u201cWe have a major problem with growing numbers of young people experiencing mental health problems in the UK today, and helping them eat a proper, healthy diet is going to be crucial in tackling this. The broad bean will be our first line of attack.\u201d Working with the William Templeton Foundation for Young People\u2019s Mental Health, Mohd-Radzman has focused on finding inexpensive and accessible ways to improve diets. \u201cThe broad bean is cheap and accessible and has known beneficial effects, so that is why I am promoting it at talks and demonstrations.\u201d The broad bean comes with a chequered history, however. It is also known as the fava bean, and under this name it was linked by the ancient Greeks to death and decay. The mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras ordered his followers not to eat them. One reason for this unpopularity arises from the fact that eating fava beans can trigger a disease called favism in a small number of vulnerable people in Mediterranean countries and the Middle East. These individuals can develop a blood disorder known as haemolytic anaemia. \u201cObviously that is an issue that has to be looked at,\u201d said Mohd-Radzman. \u201cOne solution is to find broad bean varieties that contain low levels of the chemicals that trigger favism in susceptible people. However, the real solution is to create versions that have been genetically edited using Crispr technology and which contain no traces of the chemicals that trigger favism \u2013 and that is what we have started working on.\u201d In the meantime, Mohd-Radzman is continuing to find more and more ways to get broad beans into our diets. \u201cYou can make a milk from them. You can fry them with salt. You can even ferment them with chilli to make a paste like kimchi. You can make salads with them or mix them with chorizo. You can do all sorts of things with broad beans. They are incredibly adaptable.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-29T10:07:09Z",
            "content": "After Hurricane Beryl stomped across the Caribbean, days after torrential rainfall destroyed thousands of homes in Ghana and Niger, it was evident that the two regions face many of the same challenges. Weeks of catastrophic events underscore the increasing necessity to transform the world\u2019s financial architecture to support these areas. Earlier this summer, two big conferences happened simultaneously, about 7,000 miles apart. One in the Caribbean, Antigua, and the other in Africa,Kenya. The themes were similar: the financial conundrum and developmental crises plaguing the regions. The fourth Small Island Developing States (Sids4) conference and the African Development Bank (AfDB) conference brought to the forefront all of the present issues. Africa\u2019s optimist-in-chief, Akinwumi Adesina, AfDB president, gave multiple speeches accentuating the widespread hope for the region, that Africa was finally taking the wheel, navigating its own way towards sustainable development in the face of the climate crisis. In contrast, over in Antigua, politicians berated western superpowers for empty promises made at Cop27. On the opening day of the Nairobi conference, entitled \u201cAfrica\u2019s transformation, the AfDB group and the reform of the global financial architecture\u201d, Adesina outlined the crucial role of the bank in driving transformation. Numerous African heads of state spoke, including Kenya\u2019s beleaguered President Ruto, himself facing an avalanche of violent repercussions over taxation and financial austerity measures. Africa and the Caribbean face similar and significant issues \u2013 a mixed bag of opportunities and challenges. Although contributing least to the global climate crisis, these regions bear the brunt of its devastating impacts. \u201cAfrica loses $7-$15bn annually to climate change, projected to reach $50bn by 2030,\u201d Adesina said, a reality that resonates in the Caribbean. Both regions suffer disproportionately from extreme weather events and environmental degradation, despite their minimal carbon emissions. The accessibility and availability of loss and damage funds is paramount for Africa and the Caribbean. These funds are essential for rebuilding and adapting to the frequent and severe climate-related disasters. \u201cBuilding resilience against climate shocks is crucial for Africa\u2019s economic future,\u201d says Adesina. This sentiment is equally true for the Caribbean, where hurricanes and tropical storms cause extensive damage and economic disruption. Africa and the Caribbean face significant disparities in the allocation of special drawing rights (SDRs) from global financial institutions. SDRs, a type of monetary resource in the form of reserve assets created by the International Monetary Fund, are crucial for providing liquidity to countries facing economic crises. However, the current system disproportionately favours wealthier nations that do not need it, leaving the likes of Africa and the Caribbean with insufficient support. \u201cThe outdated global financial system needs a radical reboot to address Africa\u2019s financial needs,\u201d a recent Mo Ibrahim Foundation report stated. This call for reform is equally relevant for the Caribbean, which also struggles with the inequitable distribution of SDRs. Enhanced representation and more equitable financial mechanisms are necessary to ensure that both regions receive the support they need to build resilience and achieve sustainable development. Debt is a pervasive issue that hampers the economic growth and development of Africa and the Caribbean. African countries face high borrowing costs due to perceived risk premiums, which Adesina argues are unfairly assessed. \u201cThere needs to be a fairer assessment of Africa\u2019s risk,\u201d he said, advocating for more concessional financing and efficient public expenditure. Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, has spoken many times on significant debt burdens aggravated by frequent natural disasters and economic volatility. This debt crisis limits countries\u2019 ability to invest in critical infrastructure and social services, making it imperative to address these disparities through global financial reforms. Both regions need more concessional financing options and debt-relief mechanisms that reflect their unique vulnerabilities and developmental needs. Corruption and illicit financial flows (IFFs) are significant impediments to economic development in Africa and the Caribbean. These issues drain essential resources that could otherwise be invested in public services and infrastructure. The Mo Ibrahim Foundation report emphasises the importance of preventing IFFs and strengthening tax systems to mobilise domestic resources effectively. \u201cAfrica needs not more money, but smarter money,\u201d the report concludes. This paradigm shift involves improving governance, enhancing transparency and leveraging domestic assets for sustainable growth. The Caribbean, facing similar challenges, must also adopt robust measures to combat corruption and IFFs, ensuring that resources are used effectively for the benefit of all citizens. Conflict and crime are additional challenges that undermine stability and development in both regions. In Africa, geopolitical tensions and internal conflicts disrupt economic activities and exacerbate poverty. The Caribbean, while not facing the same scale of armed conflict, grapples with high crime rates fuelled by the drug trade and social unrest that hinder economic progress and deter investment. Addressing these issues requires comprehensive strategies that include economic opportunities, social cohesion, and robust law enforcement. Both regions must prioritise peace building and crime reduction as part of their broader development agendas. Africa\u2019s demographic potential, with a youthful population that will become a significant portion of the global workforce, is mirrored in the Caribbean, where young people also represent a critical resource for future growth. By 2050, Africa will account for a quarter of the global labour force, rising above 40% by 2100. This demographic dividend presents immense opportunities for economic development through skill development, entrepreneurship and innovation. However, youth unemployment remains a critical issue in both regions. One in four young people in Africa are not in employment, education or training (Neet), a challenge that also resonates in the Caribbean. Furthermore, brain drain is a serious concern in Africa and the Caribbean; according to the Ichikowitz Family Foundation\u2019s 2022 African Youth Survey, about half of respondents aged 18 to 24 would consider leaving their native country in the next three years due to lack of employment and education opportunities. Both regions must invest in education and job creation to harness the potential of their young populations and drive sustainable development. Africa and the Caribbean are rich in natural resources, yet they often do not receive fair value for their exports. Africa\u2019s vast reserves of critical minerals are essential for the global green transition, while the Caribbean\u2019s biodiversity and marine resources hold significant potential for sustainable development. Africa must move beyond merely exporting raw materials and develop refining and manufacturing capacity to fully benefit from global value chains. This approach is equally relevant for the Caribbean, which can leverage its natural resources for higher value-added activities in agriculture, renewable energy and tourism. Home to 1.26 billion people and possessing vast natural resources, yet Africa and the Caribbean account for a small fraction of global GDP. Their futures hinge on investing in human capital, boosting domestic productivity and leveraging revenue gaps. These regions are at a crossroads, bearing immense potential but blocked by the critical need for strategic investments, partnerships and reforms in the global financial architecture. By harnessing their resources, building resilience and fostering collaboration, Africa and the Caribbean can be transformed. Their sustainable development and economic resilience is a shared responsibility, demanding a shared and global commitment to justice, equity and innovation."

            "content": "Pressure on Beijing to take steps to improve Chinese consumer confidence has intensified after news that weak retail spending dragged down the growth rate of the world\u2019s second biggest economy. With falling house prices still acting as a drag on activity, official figures showed the Chinese economy expanding at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter \u2013 much weaker than the 5.1% expected by the financial markets. Annual retail sales growth slowed from 3.2% to 2% in the three months ending in June \u2013 the weakest in 18 months \u2013 and fell slightly in June alone. Lynn Song, the chief China economist at ING bank, said retail sales growth was the lowest since the country emerged from Covid-19 lockdowns and showed the depressed state of consumer confidence remained a big headwind to the economic recovery. \u201cA negative wealth effect from falling property and stock prices, as well as low wage growth amid various industries\u2019 cost cutting is dragging consumption and causing a pivot from big-ticket purchases toward a basic \u2018eat, drink and play\u2019 theme,\u201d Song said. The government in Beijing has set a growth target for 2024 of 5% \u2013 something analysts consider to be a stretch in the absence of tax cuts, spending increases and measures to help the property market. On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded by 0.7% in the three months to June, compared with a downwardly revised 1.5% in the first quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said. To counter soft domestic demand and its property crisis, China has increased infrastructure investment and ploughed funds into hi-tech manufacturing. Strong export growth has partly compensated for the reluctance of consumers to spend. Figures released last week showed China\u2019s exports in June were up 8.6% from a year earlier, while imports shrank by 2.3%. Duncan Wrigley, the chief China+ economist at Pantheon Macro, said: \u201cThe property market is showing tentative signs of bottoming out. New home prices sank 0.67% month on month in June, a trivial improvement from the 0.71% drop in May. Preowned home prices dropped 0.85%, after the 1.00% dive in May. Residential sales value fell 12.2% year on year in June, partly thanks to base effects, after crashing 26.4% in May.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-01T16:26:54Z",
            "content": "Companies in countries worldwide may be toying with the idea of implementing shorter working weeks, but in Greece employees have been told that, henceforth, they can put in a sixth day of labour in an unorthodox step aimed at turbocharging productivity. After outpacing other Europeans in terms of economic growth, the nation once at the heart of the continent\u2019s worst financial crisis has bucked the trend again, introducing a 48-hour working week. The measure, decried as \u201cbarbaric\u201d by unions, takes effect from Monday. \u201cIt makes no sense whatsoever,\u201d said Akis Sotiropoulos an executive committee member of the civil servants\u2019 union Adedy. \u201cWhen almost every other civilised country is enacting a four-day week, Greece decides to go the other way.\u201d The pro-business government of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, says the initiative was made necessary by the twin perils of a shrinking population and shortage of skilled workers. Prior to announcing the legislation \u2013 part of a broader set of labour laws passed last year \u2013 Mitsotakis described the projected demographic shift as a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d. In an unprecedented exodus, about 500,000 mostly young educated Greeks are estimated to have emigrated since the near decade-long debt crisis erupted in late 2009. The six-day scheme, officials say, will only apply to private businesses providing round-the-clock services. Under the extended working week, staff in select industries and manufacturing facilities will have the option of working an additional two hours a day or an extra eight-hour shift, rewarded with a top-up fee of 40% added to the daily wage. Either choice, the centre right government claims, will redress the issue of employees not being paid for overtime while also tackling the pervasive problem of undeclared work. \u201cThe nucleus of this legislation is worker-friendly, it is deeply growth-oriented,\u201d Mitsotakis said before the Greek parliament endorsed the law. \u201cAnd it brings Greece in line with the rest of Europe.\u201d But the backlash has been fierce. In a country with almost no tradition of inspections in the workplace, critics contend the reform ultimately sounds the death knell of the five-day working week, not least because it enables employers to dictate whether a sixth day of labour is required. For opponents, who have already taken to the streets in protest, the reform erodes legal protections and rolls back long-established workers\u2019 rights in the name of flexibility. \u201cIn reality this has been passed by a government ideologically committed to generating ever bigger profits for capital,\u201d said Sotiropoulos. \u201cBetter productivity comes with better work conditions, a better quality of life [for employees] and that, we now know, is about less hours not more.\u201d The measure, he said, had been made possible partly because trade unions had also seen their power wane as a result of debt-stricken Athens enacting austerity measures in return for rescue funds during the country\u2019s financial crisis. Unions have long argued that overtime enables employers to hold back on hiring more staff. Trialled four-day week programmes have repeatedly shown increased levels of productivity with researchers attributing the outcome to improved levels of focus. Belgium in 2022 legislated to give employees the legal right to spread their working week over four days instead of five, and pilot schemes have been carried out in countries including the UK, Germany, Japan, South Africa and Canada. Greeks already work the longest hours in Europe, putting in an average 41 hours a week according to the EU\u2019s statistics agency, Eurostat, although surveys have also proved they get paid much less. The left-wing opposition has frequently decried \u201cBulgarian salaries in a country of British prices\u201d, claiming the phenomenon has only exacerbated the brain drain. People on pensions, who have also been encouraged to work under the legislation, have weighed into the debate. \u201cWhat the government is essentially saying is \u2018go and work longer, we\u2019ll turn a blind eye even if you\u2019re a pensioner,\u2019\u201d said Grigoris Kalomoiris who heads the union of retired teachers (Pesek). \u201cIt knows that the majority of Greeks, on an average monthly salary of \u20ac900, can only survive until the 20th of the month. This latest barbaric measure is not going to solve the fundamental problem of labour shortages and a lot of us feel it is very unfair to unemployed young Greeks who may never have a job.\u201d"

            "content": "Stock markets in Europe and Asia took a tumble on Thursday as jitters over the future artificial intelligence-driven growth of major tech companies sparked a global sell-off. The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed the day down 0.7%, having been hit by a near 4% decline in the Dutch chipmaker ASML, a 7% drop in Germany\u2019s Infineon Technologies, and a 13.7% fall in Switzerland\u2019s semiconductor company STMicroelectronics. The rout began in the US overnight, where the tech-focused Nasdaq fell 3.6% on Wednesday, marking its biggest single-day decline since 2022. About $1tn (\u00a3776bn) was knocked off the value of the Nasdaq 100, which covers the most valuable firms on the index. The main losers were AI-related companies, including Nvidia, Tesla and the Google-owner Alphabet, whose shares have soared in recent months. Investors have poured money into the sector, to ensure they did not miss out on a potential tech boom in artificial intelligence. The fall has raised concerns about whether excitement over major tech stocks, known as the magnificent seven, has been overblown. Nvidia fell 7%, Alphabet fell 5%, Microsoft dropped 3.5% and Apple lost 3%. Other magnificent seven stocks also fell, including Facebook owner Meta, which dropped 5.6%. Tesla had its worst decline since 2020, dropping 12%. The company\u2019s boss, Elon Musk, had reported a 45% fall in profits and pushed back plans to unveil self-driving robotaxis from August to October, igniting scepticism among investors. Musk has been trying to drum up interest in plans for the robot taxis, artificial intelligence and \u201cgenuinely useful\u201d humanoid robots, as demand for Tesla\u2019s electric cars has cooled. The stock market losses later spread to Asia, where tech-related firms continued their decline. That included Samsung, which fell 2%, Sony, which fell 5%, and tech investor SoftBank, which fell 9.4%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei finished the session down 3%. However, the AJ Bell investment analyst Dan Coatsworth said the sell-off may be a \u201cnecessary correction\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is worth putting last night\u2019s weakness into perspective, given indices were recently trading at record highs and there were big moves in some enormous companies. \u201cWhether this is a necessary correction to remove some froth from the market or something more dramatic will depend on forthcoming earnings from the likes of Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Amazon next week, as well as AI-star Nvidia at the end of August.\u201d Early trading on Wall Street was more subdued on Thursday, with the Nasdaq, Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 indices slightly up, as GDP data showing that the US economy grew faster than expected in the three months to the end of June."

            "date": "2024-07-18T12:55:17Z",
            "content": "UK wage growth slowed in May to the lowest level in two years amid a cooling jobs market, underscoring the challenge for the Bank of England as policymakers decide whether to cut interest rates. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show annual pay growth eased from 5.9% in the three months to April to 5.7% in the three months to May, matching City economists\u2019 predictions. Unemployment was unchanged from 4.4% in April, while the number of job vacancies fell by 30,000 led by dwindling demand in retail and hospitality amid a continued slowdown in hiring across the economy. After a sharp fall in headline inflation over recent months, real wage growth taking into account the rising cost of living has strengthened. Total real pay, including bonuses, rose by 3% on the year in the three months to May. Growth was last higher in the three months to August 2021, when it was 4.5%. Liz McKeown, the ONS director of economic statistics, said: \u201cWe continue to see overall some signs of a cooling in the labour market, with the growth in the number of employees on the payroll weakening over the medium term and unemployment gradually increasing. \u201cEarnings growth in cash terms, while remaining relatively strong, is showing signs of slowing again. However, with inflation falling, in real terms it is at its highest rate in over two and a half years.\u201d In a sign of the cooling labour market, the latest snapshot showed there were now more than 500,000 more people out of work than this time last year, driven by a rise in economic inactivity \u2013 when working-age adults are neither in a job nor looking for one. Although economic inactivity has come down in recent months, it remains close to a record high at almost 9.4 million, with almost a third outside the workforce due to near record levels of long-term sickness. Liz Kendall, the new work and pensions secretary, said the UK was standing alone as the only G7 country where the employment rate was not back to pre-pandemic levels. \u201cThis is a truly dire inheritance which the government is determined to tackle,\u201d she said. \u201cBehind these statistics are real people, who have for too long been ignored and denied the support they need to get into work and get on at work. It\u2019s time for change.\u201d Financial markets expect Bank policymakers will hold off from cutting interest rates from the current level of 5.25% at their meeting on 1 August, instead waiting until they are convinced that inflation will remain close to the government\u2019s 2% target before reducing the cost of borrowing. Threadneedle Street has previously warned that inflation is likely to rise above 2% this year amid resilient wage growth and price increases in the service sector of the economy. The figures come after headline inflation unexpectedly remained at 2% in June for a second month in a row, while underlying measures from the service sector also held steady in a development likely to dash hopes for an August rate cut. Although wage growth is cooling, economists said at 5.7% it remained inconsistent with the Bank\u2019s 2% inflation target. Ashley Webb, a UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the slowdown in the jobs market probably was not enough to offset strength in services inflation. \u201cAs a result, we have changed our forecast for the timing of the first interest rate cut from 5.25% from August to September, although it is a close call,\u201d he said. Several members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, including its chief economist, Huw Pill, have warned in the past week that service sector inflation and a tight jobs market could force Threadneedle Street to take a cautious approach. Last month the European Central Bank became the first major global central bank to cut official borrowing costs. On Thursday it left interest rates unchanged. The US Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, this week hinted that it would not necessarily wait for US inflation to drop to its 2% target before cutting interest rates, bolstering expectations for a cut in September."

Gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of economic health \u2013 rose 2.8% in three months to June, the commerce department reported on Thursday, ahead of economists\u2019 expectations and up sharply from 1.4% in the first quarter. It comes as the presidential election campaign heightens scrutiny of the US economy. While Joe Biden touted the \u201cstrongest economy in the world\u201d as he announced his withdrawal from the race on Sunday, Donald Trump \u2013 who is running to replace him in the White House \u2013 has accused Biden of weakening the economy.

Despite relatively rosy economic figures, nearly three in five Americans wrongly believe the US is in recession, and the majority blame the Biden administration, according to a Harris poll conducted for the Guardian in May. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve scrambled to bring down inflation from its highest level in a generation, raising interest rates to a two-decade high. They are now considering when to start cutting rates, amid early signs that price growth is falling back towards the Fed\u2019s 2% target. \u201cThis is a perfect report for the Fed,\u201d Olu Sonola, head of economic research at Fitch Ratings, said of Thursday\u2019s GDP numbers. \u201cGrowth during the first half of the year is not too hot, inflation continues to cool and the elusive soft landing scenario looks within reach.\u201d Economists had expected GDP growth of about 2% in the second quarter.

            "content": "Experts are split on whether there will be a UK interest rate cut on Thursday but most agree on one thing: savers should \u201cact now\u201d to lock into the best rates while they are still available. All eyes will be on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee when it meets on 1 August, although while some believe we could see it announce the first base rate cut in more than four years, others reckon we will have to wait until at least September. \u201cSavers would do well to follow the guidance of advisers and savings professionals and take advantage of the competitive rates available,\u201d says Simon Merchant at the cash savings platform Flagstone. Whether it is instant access accounts or five-year fixed-rate savings bonds, there are plenty of inflation-beating deals out there, he says, adding: \u201cSavers should act now.\u201d The Moneyfactscompare.co.uk website is a good place to check best-buy rates for different accounts. Rachel Springall at the site says those people with some disposable income who have not done so already \u201cwould be wise to grab a top-rate savings account to keep it safe and earn some decent interest\u201d. Be aware that best-buy accounts can have their rate cut or be quickly withdrawn if providers are hit with an influx of deposits. On Thursday, the average one-year fixed-rate savings bond on sale was paying 4.64%. With these accounts, savers\u2019 return is guaranteed. The top-paying ones are now offering rates above 5%: at the time of writing, there were table-topping one-year fixed-rate bonds on offer from providers such as Union Bank of India (UK) Ltd and MBNA paying 5.4% and 5.15% respectively (in both cases the minimum deposit is \u00a31,000). For those able to tie up their cash for two years, there are two-year bonds paying up to 5%, says Moneyfactscompare.co.uk. In terms of better-known names, Atom bank (minimum deposit \u00a350) and Close Brothers Savings (minimum deposit \u00a310,000) were paying 4.9% over two years. However, not everyone will be willing or able to lock away their cash over the medium to long term. Some will prefer the flexibility offered by an easy access account. There are a few easy access accounts paying 5% or more, including ones offered by Oxbury Bank and Monument Bank. More well-known names offering decent rates include Leeds building society (4.85%) and Skipton building society (4.8%, but only one withdrawal a year allowed on this account). As can be seen from those mentioned, the more eye-catching savings rates are mainly offered by smaller players such as challenger banks and building societies. If Britons\u2019 savings are with a big high street bank and they haven\u2019t looked lately at what rate they are getting, they may well find it is pretty rubbish. Just over a year ago, MPs told Britain\u2019s biggest banks to stop fobbing off loyal customers with \u201cmeasly\u201d savings rates, and the main regulator has also fired off warning shots. But despite that, the consumer group Which? says high street banks are still lagging behind with \u201cpaltry\u201d rates. The organisation examined savings rates between January and June 2024 on various types of accounts. The interest rate gap between traditional high street banks and newer challenger banks and building societies was most pronounced with instant access accounts. In January, major banks were averaging a mere 1.9% interest on these. In contrast, building societies averaged 2.9%, and challenger banks 3.3%. By June, the average rate for big banks had fallen to 1.6%, while the rates for building societies and challenger banks had remained stable. If savers are on a poor rate, now is the time to move their money to an institution offering a better deal."

            "content": "Households\u2019 hopes of a cut in interest rates have received a setback after the chief economist of the Bank of England warned that key measures of inflation remained \u201cuncomfortably high\u201d. Huw Pill, one of the nine members of Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), strongly hinted he would vote to keep official borrowing costs at 5.25% when he said wage growth and inflation in the services sector were proving persistent. \u201cI think it\u2019s still an open question on whether the timing for a rate cut is now,\u201d Pill said in an unscripted conclusion of a speech to the Asia House thinktank in London. Pill\u2019s comments had an immediate impact in the financial markets, which had been betting 60-40 in favour of a rate cut when the MPC meets early next month but now see only a 50-50 chance of a move. Pill was among the majority when the MPC voted 7-2 at its last meeting in late June to keep borrowing costs at 5.25%, but is seen by the market as less hardline than some of his colleagues and a potential swing voter. Jonathan Haskell, another member of the MPC, said earlier this week that he favoured keeping rates unchanged. Interest rates were raised at 14 successive meetings of the MPC between December 2021 and August 2023, taking them from 0.1% to their current level. Pill said not too much should be read into headline inflation \u2013 as measured by the consumer prices index \u2013 falling back to the government\u2019s 2% target. Instead, the MPC was focused on three measures of inflation persistence: labour market tightness, pay growth and services price inflation. \u201cOn the basis of recent out turns, at the margin recent developments in these indicators have hinted towards some upside risk to my assessment of inflation persistence,\u201d he said. Pill added that there was a risk that inflation would return above the Bank\u2019s 2% target as a strong labour market, resilient wage growth, and prices in the service sector offset cooling energy prices, which have helped to cut the headline rate in recent months. \u201cThere is a threat to go higher through the second half of this year, [but] we\u2019re not talking about dramatic changes.\u201d The Bank\u2019s chief economist said there was a danger that focusing too much on the return of inflation to the 2% target in May could lead to \u201ccomplacency, maybe taking your eye off the ball\u201d. He said the Bank would be \u201cresolute\u201d in focusing on hitting the inflation target. \u201cNot just today but through time.\u201d Asked whether this suggested the Bank would take a cautious approach to setting interest rates, he said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t back away too much from that.\u201d Despite his cautious approach, Pill said it was still a matter of when, not if, rates would be cut."

            "content": "Savers are always on the lookout for the best interest rates and the UK seems like a good bet at the moment. In recent months, the pound has climbed in value against the euro and the dollar as economists speculate that UK interest rates will remain at 5.25% for longer than previously expected. While the odds of a cut in borrowing have shortened, with a narrow majority of City analysts expecting a reduction, few outside the Square Mile believe a change is imminent. If anything, Bank officials will send sterling to even greater heights when they signal, as seems likely, that a cut remains some way off. Suren Thiru, economics director of accountancy body the ICAEW, says he still expects the Bank to lower interest rates to 4.75% by the end of the year, but \u201can August rate cut is looking less likely\u201d. Charlie Bean, an economist at the London School of Economics and a former deputy governor of the Bank, says he will be surprised if the cost of borrowing was reduced this week. In March, the Bank\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) said falling inflation and a weak outlook for the economy meant it was on course to lower interest rates. The committee signalled three rate cuts this year and more to come in 2025. Then came figures showing a strong bounce back from last year\u2019s mild recession. According to the latest S&amp;P Global survey of the business sector, manufacturers and services companies are winning new orders and growing in confidence about the outlook for employment and profits. Adding to the sense that the economy was doing fine without lower borrowing costs, official figures for May and June revealed wages growth remained above 5.5% and firms that were laying off workers last year had begun to hire again. The Bank has a mandate from parliament to maintain inflation at about 2% over the longer term. And while the consumer prices index was 2% in May and June, there was concern that wage pressures would reverse the trend. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as fuel and food, is stuck above 3%. Worse, the services inflation figure, which track what businesses charge each, other remains persistently above 5%. Stephen Millard, deputy director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, says: \u201cThe question is whether we are seeing enough evidence to show inflation is going to stay low.\u201d He believes the Bank needs more time to assess the economic situation before beginning to reverse the 14 consecutive rate rises that took place between December 2021 and August last year. Bean says if he was still on the MPC, he would want more evidence that wages were going to fall and that services companies, which have passed on most of their cost increases to customers over the past two years, would stop doing so. The MPC publishes its latest quarterly assessment of the economic outlook on Thursday and is expected to revise upwards its growth forecast for this year and next. A rise from low to moderate growth is welcome news, but is likely to disguise a deteriorating situation in the labour market, which will be characterised by rising unemployment and, about six months from now, falling wages growth. While the overall economy is growing, there are large pockets of industry and the services sector suffering from financial distress, partly as a result of high interest bills. Consumers are also reluctant to spend and businesses are shy of making investment decisions while there is uncertainty about the path of interest rates. Thiru accuses of the Bank of \u201cdithering\u201d when the broad picture shows the UK\u2019s private sector is largely stagnant and desperately in need of lower borrowing costs. The European Central Bank has already cut rates and the US Federal Reserve is poised to follow suit. Thiru is among many analysts who argue that the UK badly needs a boost from lower borrowing costs. \u201cThere is a pressing need to cut rates given the level of stagnation in the economy,\u201d he says. At the last MPC meeting, only two members voted for a cut. With at least four members known to be reluctant to usher in cheaper money, the power falls to governor Andrew Bailey and the other two floating voters. If Bailey joins \u201cthe hawkish four\u201d, judging a further delay necessary, savers will cheer. Those who have accumulated debts will need to wait."

But, he said: \u201cIf inflation were to prove stickier, and we were seeing higher rates of inflation and disappointed readings, we would weigh that along with other things.\u201d He said that the \u201clast couple of readings have added to confidence\u201d that inflation is moving down towards the Fed\u2019s target of 2%. Meanwhile, the labor market made \u201ca move from over-heated to more normal conditions\u201d. Powell said: \u201cWe think we don\u2019t need to be 100% focused on inflation because of the progress that we\u2019ve made.\u201d Rates have held steady at a two-decade high of 5.25% to 5.5% over the past year. The Fed last raised interest rates in July last year, the 11th time it had hiked rates. Rates were at near zero during the early pandemic, from 2020 to early 2022. The Fed has been trying to balance its \u201cdual mandate\u201d of cooling inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in the summer of 2022, with minimal damage to the labor market. The unemployment rate in June rose slightly to 4.1%, the highest it had been since late 2021. Though Fed officials have not explicitly said the central bank will cut rates at their next meeting in mid-September, investors have expected that cuts could start if inflation remains cool. Hints often show up in small changes in the Fed\u2019s press release after the FOMC meeting. This time around, Fed officials seem to suggest they are paying more attention to keeping the labor market balanced with inflation, rather than being laser-focused on bringing down inflation. \u201cThe economic outlook is uncertain,\u201d the Fed wrote in its press release after last month\u2019s meeting, \u201cand the committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.\u201d This month, the Fed said it \u201cis attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate\u201d. Inflation stood at 3% in June, down from 3.3% in May. The Fed\u2019s target inflation rate is 2%. The core personal consumption expenditure index, measured by the US commerce department, also showed a cooling in economic activity. The prices of goods and services minus food and fuel, which experience price swings, measured by the index was 2.6% in June, offering another reflection of decreasing prices to the Fed. In comparison, the core index was at 4.3% the same time last year. Other Fed officials have implied more strongly that they believe cuts could come later this year. \u201cThe time to lower the policy rate is drawing close,\u201d Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, said in remarks on 17 July. \u201cRight now, the labor market is in a sweet spot. We need to keep the labor market in this sweet spot.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-08T15:57:12Z",
            "content": "A senior Bank of England policymaker has said Britain\u2019s battle against inflation remains incomplete, requiring interest rates to be kept at elevated levels for longer than expected in financial markets. Pouring cold water on City predictions for a cut in rates in August, Jonathan Haskel said inflation was on course to return above the government\u2019s 2% target. \u201cI would rather hold rates until there is more certainty that underlying inflationary pressures have subsided sustainably,\u201d said Haskel, a member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), in a speech at King\u2019s College London on Monday. While adding there were \u201cencouraging signs\u201d in the battle against fast-rising prices after a drop in the headline rate of consumer price inflation to 2% in May, he warned that the return to the official target set by the government would be temporary amid pressures from a tight jobs market. \u201cThe playing out of those shocks through the economy, and the continued tight and impaired labour market, means that inflation will remain above target for quite some time,\u201d he said. Financial markets currently estimate there is a 60% chance the Bank will cut interest rates on 1 August for the first time since the Covid pandemic. While some members of the Bank\u2019s nine-strong MPC have pushed for a cut in official borrowing costs over recent months, Haskel has voted to keep rates on hold. The economist, who will complete his term on the MPC at the end of August, has previously expressed caution over cutting rates, as one of the more hawkish members of the rate-setting panel. The appointment of his successor will fall to the new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, as one of her first tasks in government. In the first speech by one of the Bank\u2019s policymakers since the general election, Haskel said the lingering impact from soaring energy prices after the Russian invasion of Ukraine had been \u201csufficient to impart momentum to current inflation\u201d. UK inflation peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. \u201cThe labour market continues to be tight, and I worry it is still impaired. I would rather hold rates until there is more certainty that underlying inflationary pressures have subsided sustainably,\u201d he said. Rishi Sunak had argued before last week\u2019s election that \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d taken by his Conservative government had helped the economy \u201cturn a corner\u201d, making a pitch to the electorate that a vote for the Tories was a vote for lower interest rates. The former prime minister called the general election in May after official figures confirmed inflation had dropped to 2.3% in April, amid hopes in Tory circles that the Bank would cut interest rates in June, before the ballot. However, the central bank kept rates unchanged at 5.25% last month, having consistently warned that inflation was likely to rise later this year, amid pressure from rising prices in the service sector and resilient wage growth. Having shifted his party to the economic centre, Keir Starmer argued that Labour would bring stability to policymaking after years of turmoil under the Conservatives and boost economic growth as a result."

            "date": "2024-07-21T06:00:10Z",
            "content": "Artificial intelligence that scans GP records to find hidden patterns has helped doctors detect significantly more cancer cases. The rate of cancer detection rose from 58.7% to 66.0% at GP practices using the \u201cC the Signs\u201d AI tool. This analyses a patient\u2019s medical record to pull together their past medical history, test results, prescriptions and treatments, as well as other personal characteristics that might indicate cancer risk, such as their postcode, age and family history. It also prompts GPs to ask patients about any new symptoms, and if the tool detects patterns in the data that indicate a higher risk of a particular type of cancer, then it recommends which tests or clinical pathway the patient should be referred to. C the Signs is used in about 1,400 practices in England \u2013 about 15% \u2013 and was tested in 35 practices in the east of England in May 2021, covering a population of 420,000 patients. The results, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, show that the cancer detection rate rose from 58.7% to 66.0% by 31 March 2022, while those practices not using the system remained at a similar rate. Bea Bakshi, a GP who created the system with her colleague, Miles Payling, said: \u201cIt could be a scan, an ultrasound, or they could need to be seen by a specialist at a clinic.\u201d Patients are tracked through the C the Signs system to remind doctors to check test results and referrals elsewhere. \u201cOur system has detected over 50 different types of cancers,\u201d Bakshi said. \u201cThe key thing is that it\u2019s not only an earlier diagnosis, but a faster diagnosis.\u201d Bakshi and her colleagues also sought to validate the tool by assessing 118,677 patients in a previous study, which found that 7,295 were diagnosed with cancer and 7,056 were successfully identified by the algorithm. Where the tool came to the conclusion that it was unlikely a patient did have cancer, only 239 out of 8,453 went on to have a confirmed cancer diagnosis within six months (about 2.8%). Bakshi developed the tool after meeting a patient in hospital who had been given a late diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and died three weeks later. \u201cIt stayed with me as a problem area,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy are patients with cancer being diagnosed so late?\u201d The UK has three cancer screening programmes, for bowel, breast and cervical cancers, but there are 200 different types of cancer which may be asymptomatic or create symptoms easily confused with other conditions. \u201cTwo-thirds of deaths are in the non-screenable cancers and the ones that we aren\u2019t screening for,\u201d Bakshi said. \u201cPatients visit GPs between three and five times before they are recognised as being at risk of cancer. GPs detect an average of eight cases of cancer a year.\u201d GPs use guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to make decisions about when to make a cancer referral. \u201cThey\u2019re quite comprehensive guidelines, but no GP can remember them all,\u201d said Peter Holloway, a GP who chairs the Primary Care Group for the East of England Cancer Alliances and a co-author on the study. \u201cWe know a lot of cancers present with vague symptoms and some are difficult to define and don\u2019t necessarily correlate with our guidelines.\u201d Holloway saw a patient in his early 60s who had diarrhoea and some lower abdominal pain. \u201cVery common symptoms, and not things that would lead you to do a referral for suspected cancer,\u201d he said. But the C the Signs tool recommended a faecal test. \u201cThe test was positive, he was referred and he turned out to have colorectal cancer, which was diagnosed early and treated successfully,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cHe\u2019s fine, but if we\u2019d followed the rigid guidelines, he may not have got referred for several months.\u201d The NHS England Long Term Plan for Cancer aims to have 75% of all cancers diagnosed by stage one or stage two by 2028. The NHS is also conducting research into whether the Galleri blood test, which attempts to detect DNA from more than 50 different types of tumours, is effective. The trial began in September 2021, and 140,000 people have been tested. Holloway said that decision support systems such as C the Signs were an important part of cancer detection, alongside improving patient awareness of different types of possible symptoms of cancer, and getting better access to diagnostic technology such as CT and MRI scanners. Prof Peter Johnson, National Clinical Director for Cancer at NHS England, said: \u201cDespite increased demand and pressure on services, record numbers of people are being checked and treated for cancer, and we are now diagnosing a higher proportion of cancers at an early stage, increasing people\u2019s chances of survival. \u201cWe know we have a lot more to do to help people with cancer get the care they need, and using the most up-to-date technology is an important part of our work to reduce waits and find cancers earlier, such as \u2018teledermatology\u2019 to diagnose skin cancers, or community lung trucks, and home testing for bowel cancer.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-09T10:40:12Z",
            "content": "What if AI isn\u2019t that great? What if we\u2019ve been overstating its potential to a frankly dangerous degree? That\u2019s the concern of leading cancer experts in the NHS, who warn that the health service is obsessing over new tech to the point that it\u2019s putting patient safety at risk. From our story yesterday: In a sharply worded warning, the cancer experts say that \u2018novel solutions\u2019 such as new diagnostic tests have been wrongly hyped as \u2018magic bullets\u2019 for the cancer crisis, but \u2018none address the fundamental issues of cancer as a systems problem\u2019. A \u2018common fallacy\u2019 of NHS leaders is the assumption that new technologies can reverse inequalities, the authors add. The reality is that tools such as AI can create \u2018additional barriers for those with poor digital or health literacy\u2019. \u2018We caution against technocentric approaches without robust evaluation from an equity perspective,\u2019 the paper concludes. Published in the Lancet Oncology journal, the paper instead argues for a back to basics approach to cancer care. Its proposals focus on solutions like getting more staff, redirecting research to less trendy areas including surgery and radiotherapy, and creating a dedicated unit for technology transfer, ensuring that treatments that have already been proven to work are actually made a part of routine care. Against those much-needed improvements, AI can be an appealing distraction. The promise of the technology is that, within a few short years, a radical capability increase will enable AI technology to do jobs in the health service that can\u2019t currently be done, or at least that take up hours of a highly trained specialist\u2019s time. And the fear of the experts is that that promise about the future is distracting from changes needed today. It effectively casts AI as the latest example of \u201cbionic duckweed\u201d, a term coined by Stian Westlake in 2020 to cover the use, deliberately or otherwise, of technology that may or may not arrive in the future to argue against investment in the present. Elon Musk\u2019s Hyperloop is perhaps the most famous example of bionic duckweed, first proposed more than a decade ago explicitly to try and discourage California from going ahead with plans to construct a high-speed rail line. (The term comes from a real instance in the wild, in which the UK government was advised against electrifying railways in 2007 because \u201cwe might have \u2026 trains using hydrogen developed from bionic duckweed in 15 years\u2019 time \u2026 we might have to take the wires down and it would all be wasted\u201d. Seventeen years on, the UK continues to run diesel engines on non-electrified lines.) But the paper\u2019s fears about AI \u2013 and the general technophilia of the health service \u2013 are more than just that it might not arrive. Even if AI does actually start making headway in fighting cancer, without the right groundwork, it may be less useful than it could be. Back to the piece, a quote from the lead author, oncologist Ajay Aggarwal: AI is a workflow tool, but actually, is it going to improve survival? Well, we\u2019ve got limited evidence of that so far. Yes, it\u2019s something that could potentially help the workforce, but you still need people to take a patient\u2019s history, to take blood, to do surgery, to break bad news. Even if AI is as good as we hope it will be, in the short term, that might mean little for healthcare in general. Say AI can meaningfully speed up the work of a radiographer, diagnosing cancer earlier or faster after a scan: that means little if there are bottlenecks in the rest of the health service. In the worst-case scenario, you may even see a sort of AI-enabled denial of service attack, with the tech-powered sections of the workflow overwhelming the rest of the system. In the long term, AI boosters hope, systems will adapt to incorporate the technology well. (Or, if you\u2019re a true believer, then perhaps it\u2019s simply a case of waiting until AI can staff a hospital end-to-end.) But in the short term, it\u2019s important not to assume that just because AI can do some medical tasks, it can help fix a health system in crisis. Digital government Last week we looked at some ideas for what the new government could do around tech, and it\u2019s looking good for at least one of those suggestions. New secretary of state for science, innovation and technology Peter Kyle has been in office for just a few days, but is already hitting my inbox. The DSIT, he says, will: Become the centre for digital expertise and delivery in government, improving how the government and public services interact with citizens. We will act as a leader and partner across government, with industry and the research communities, to boost Britain\u2019s economic performance and power-up our public services to improve the lives and life chances of people through the application of science and technology. Specifically, DSIT will \u201chelp to upskill civil servants so they are better at using digital and AI in their frontline work\u201d. Last week, we called on Labour to \u201ctake AI government seriously\u201d; it looks as if they already are. Digital colleagues On the one hand, look, this is obviously a publicity stunt: Lattice is going to bring an AI employee through all the same processes a human employee goes through when they start a new role. We\u2019ll be adding them into the employee record and integrating them into our HRIS; we\u2019ll be adding them to the org chart so you can see where they fall within a team and department; we will be onboarding the AI employee and ensuring they undergo the training necessary for their role. And we will be assigning goals to this digital worker, to make sure we are holding them accountable to certain standards \u2013 just like we would with any other employee. This is going to be a huge learning moment for us, and for the industry. That\u2019s Sarah Franklin, the chief executive of HR platform Lattice, talking about the company\u2019s plans to take an AI employee through all the same steps as a human one. But if you want a peek at what AI success would look like, it\u2019s not far off this. Businesses are bad at bringing in new technology. If something works well enough, they tend to stick with it for years \u2013 decades, even \u2013 and it\u2019s a huge hurdle to encourage them to switch to a different way of doing things even if the gains seem great. But they\u2019re much better at bringing in new staff. They have to be: staff quit, retire, have children or die. If you can adapt the process of bringing in an AI worker to be more like the latter, and less like the former, you may well end up greatly expanding the pool of businesses who feel like they can deploy AI in their own world.

            "date": "2024-07-19T05:00:33Z",
            "content": "The roar of the waves on the shore in Mokha mean the Yemeni men have to shout to each other as they load their supplies into the fishing boats docked at the small landing site on the beach. Alongside their nets, fuel canisters and food, the men add firewood, metal frames and old car tyres. \u201cFarmers have pastures, and us fishermen, too, have feeding grounds we are responsible for,\u201d says Ahmed Dawood. \u201cOur farms are underwater, and our feed is piles of discarded scrap.\u201d Along the Red Sea coast, particularly in fishing towns such as Mokha, fishing communities are sinking scrap materials and tyres into the sea to build their own artificial reefs in a DIY approach to declining fish populations and the slow destruction of coral reefs, which serve as key nurseries for marine life. According to Dawood, the fishers sail to specific areas called matrahs (literally \u201cplace where something is thrown\u201d), located several miles offshore, to sink their unorthodox cargo. \u201cIt\u2019s an old practice that we\u2019ve inherited from our ancestors and it works,\u201d he says. \u201cOver time, the scrap attracts droves of fish.\u201d In Yemen, with its 1,200-mile (1,900km) coastline, fishing is an essential source of income for coastal communities and for the country\u2019s economy. A 2019 report in 2019 indicated that the sector contributed about 15% of the country\u2019s GDP came from fishing, making it the second-largest source of export revenues after oil and gas. Yet overfishing, driven by rising living costs and fuel prices caused by Yemen\u2019s 10-year war and the ensuing humanitarian crisis, has led to a decrease in fish catches from 400,000 tons a year in 1993 to an estimated 50,000 tons in 2023. To address the decline, most fishers are increasingly turning to matrahs, which their forebears would create using rocks and fallen trees. \u201cFishermen in Yemen have recently revived the old practice to boost fish yields,\u201d says Issam al-Sufyani, an officer in the Yemeni coastguard. \u201cWhile the method is primitive, it might restore some of what the Yemeni maritime region has lost and continues to lose due to the deliberate dredging of marine life by large fishing boats.\u201d However, Omar Nasif, a professor of marine biology at the Marine Science Research Laboratory in Cairo, says the pollution from the waste being dumped into the sea cannot be ignored. \u201cScrap can never replace natural marine environments,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s inorganic waste, which has the potential to pollute and ultimately destroy the ecosystem.\u201d Anwar al-Shadhli, an environmental management specialist, shares Nasif\u2019s concerns and opposes the practice. \u201cAny solid waste dumped into the sea is considered a foreign object, regardless of the benefits fishermen might gain,\u201d he says. \u201cDissolved plastic particles affect marine plankton, rusty metals accumulate in fish gills, and copper salts halt vital processes in coral reefs. \u201cHeavy metals are also released from metal structures and end up accumulating in marine organisms, leading to [heavy] metal deposition, which can make its way through the food chain back to humans.\u201d Abdulraqeeb al-Okishsi, director of adaptation at Yemen\u2019s Environmental Protection Authority, says the submerged solid objects do work to attract fish and encourage breeding. \u201cWhen materials sink, all sorts of marine life attach to them. New surfaces covered with algae and other organisms attract plankton, which in turn attract other species for feeding,\u201d Okishsi says. \u201cOver years, these areas often develop into integrated environments, unique in their diversity,\u201d he says. Most boat owners now rely heavily on fishing matrahs, \u201cThese areas become all fishermen\u2019s refuge during the monsoon winds on Yemen\u2019s western coast between October and May, which makes sailing far out extremely dangerous,\u201d said Saeed Ghali, a fisher from Al-Khawkhah. Environmental concerns are not the only issues troubling experts. The director general of the fisheries authority, Wadadh al-Madhhaji, has condemned the matrahs for causing conflicts, as such sites are then considered exclusive fishing areas by those who have created them. Abdullah Abdo Majhasi, a community leader in Al-Khawkhah, says most fisheries disputes are now related to accusations of \u201cpoaching\u201d in matrahs. \u201cThese are usually resolved through maritime customary law, with penalties varying depending on the issue. For instance, the violator might face a fine or be barred from fishing for seven to three days, along with signing a pledge,\u201d he says. There are no government measures to regulate the matrahs. Sufyani and his colleagues in the coastguard try to stop the sinking of metal and plastic waste and to limit the dumping to rocks and vegetation \u2013 efforts that also meet with resistance. \u201cIt is not easy for fishermen to give up \u2018pastures\u2019 they have created over 30 years,\u201d he says. Matrahs have now spread along the Red Sea coast from the Bab al-Mandab strait, opposite Djibouti, northwards to Midi on the Saudi border, according to Sufyani. \u201cThe haul we fish, moving from one area to another over the span of an entire day, can be secured from one matrah in just a few hours, which significantly cuts our gasoline costs,\u201d says Ghali. \u201cFishing is our only means of livelihood, and our boats must return loaded every day at the lowest possible costs. Without these matrahs, our lives would be difficult.\u201d This article is published in collaboration with Egab."

            "date": "2024-07-29T19:59:51Z",
            "content": "Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence agency has claimed it was involved in an ambush that killed fighters from Russia\u2019s Wagner group in the west African nation of Mali, thousands of miles away from the frontline in Ukraine. A Telegram channel linked to the Wagner leadership on Monday admitted the group had suffered heavy losses during fighting in Mali last week. It said Wagner and the Malian armed forces had \u201cfought fierce battles\u201d over a five-day period against a coalition of Tuareg separatist forces and jihadi groups, who had used heavy weapons, drones and suicide bombers. Numerous Wagner fighters, including a commander, Sergei Shevchenko, were killed, the channel said. Andrii Yusov, spokesman for Ukraine\u2019s GUR military intelligence agency, said on Monday that \u201cthe rebels received necessary information, and not just information, which enabled a successful military operation against Russian war criminals\u201d. Yusov did not say whether Ukrainian military personnel were involved in the fighting or were present in the country. He said the agency \u201cwon\u2019t discuss the details at the moment, but there will be more to come\u201d. The Mali government, which has been fighting various insurgencies in the north of the country for more than a decade, requested help from Wagner after a military junta took power in 2020. In May last year, the US imposed sanctions on the head of Wagner in Mali, accusing the group of using its operation there as a conduit for military equipment for the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces are believed to be active in Sudan, another place where Wagner troops have been heavily involved in fighting, in a further sign that Kyiv\u2019s fight with Moscow has taken on a global dimension. The Wagner group was set up by Yevgeny Prigozhin, an old acquaintance of Vladimir Putin who built up the fighting force as a way for Moscow to intervene in conflicts without official use of the Russian military. It has carried out much of the most fierce fighting in Ukraine, often using former prisoners who were pardoned in exchange for a stint on the frontline. The group is also active across Africa, and continues to be so even after Prigozhin was disgraced following a failed coup attempt last summer. He later died after an explosion onboard his plane, widely believed to have been ordered by the Kremlin, but Wagner\u2019s influence in Africa remains. \u201cFor Moscow, the African countries where Wagner is present is just a zone of interest that allows it to get hold of resources \u2013 gold, diamonds, gas and oil \u2013 and the money goes to finance Russian aggression,\u201d said Serhii Kuzan, director of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center in Kyiv, explaining why Ukraine might want to target Wagner in Africa. He added that the raids had additional benefits for Kyiv: \u201cliquidating\u201d some of the most experienced Wagner fighters and lowering the overall military potential of the group, and also exacting revenge for war crimes in Ukraine. \u201cA significant part of the destroyed fighters got military experience in Ukraine, where they carried out hundreds or thousands of war crimes \u2026 these crimes should be punished, and Russian war criminals should know that they will never be safe,\u201d said Kuzan. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 July 2024 to remove a reference to a photograph published by the Kyiv Post purporting to show Malian rebels holding a Ukrainian flag, which could not be independently verified."

            "date": "2024-07-27T09:07:20Z",
            "content": "Last year, Rachel Antell, an archival producer for documentary films, started noticing AI-generated images mixed in with authentic photos. There are always holes or limitations in an archive; in one case, film-makers got around a shortage of images for a barely photographed 19th-century woman by using AI to generate what looked like old photos. Which brought up the question: should they? And if they did, what sort of transparency is required? The capability and availability of generative AI \u2013 the type that can produce text, images and video \u2013 have changed so rapidly, and the conversations around it have been so fraught, that film-makers\u2019 ability to use it far outpaces any consensus on how. \u201cWe realized it was kind of the wild west, and film-makers without any mal-intent were getting themselves into situations where they could be misleading to an audience,\u201d said Antell. \u201cAnd we thought, what\u2019s needed here is some real guidance.\u201d So Antell and several colleagues formed the Archival Producers Alliance (APA), a volunteer group of about 300 documentary producers and researchers dedicated to, in part, developing best practices for use of generative AI in factual storytelling. \u201cInstead of being, \u2018the house is burning, we\u2019ll never have jobs,\u2019 it\u2019s much more based around an affirmation of why we got into this in the first place,\u201d said Stephanie Jenkins, a founding APA member. Experienced documentary film-makers have \u201creally been wrestling with this\u201d, in part because \u201cthere is so much out there about AI that is so confusing and so devastating or, alternatively, a lot of snake oil.\u201d The group, which published an open letter warning against \u201cforever muddying the historical record\u201d through generative AI and released a draft set of guidelines this spring, is one of the more organized efforts in Hollywood to grapple with the ethics of a technology that, for all the bullish or doomsday prophesying, is already here and shaping the industry. Short of regulation or relevant union agreements, it has come down to film-makers \u2013 directors, producers, writers, visual effects and VFX artists and more \u2013 to figure out how to use it, where to draw the line and how to adapt. \u201cIt\u2019s a project by project basis\u201d for \u201cuse cases and the ethical implications of AI\u201d, said Jim Geduldick, a VFX supervisor and cinematographer who has worked on Masters of the Air, Disney\u2019s live-action Pinocchio and the upcoming Robert Zemeckis film Here, which uses AI to de-age its stars Tom Hanks and Robin Wright. \u201cEverybody\u2019s using it. Everybody\u2019s playing with it.\u201d Some of the industry\u2019s adoption of AI has been quiet \u2013 for years, studios and tech companies with entertainment arms have already engaged in a tacit machine learning arms race. Others have embraced the technology enthusiastically and optimistically; Runway, an AI research company, hosted its second annual AI Film Festival in New York and Los Angeles this spring, with presenting partners in the Television Academy and the Tribeca Festival. The latter featured five short films made by OpenAI\u2019s Sora, the text-to-video model yet to be released to the public that prompted the film mogul Tyler Perry to halt an $800m expansion of his studios in Atlanta because \u201cjobs are going to be lost\u201d. The industry\u2019s embrace has engendered plenty of pushback. Last month, in response to Tribeca and other nascent AI film festivals, the director of Violet, Justine Bateman, announced a \u201craw and real\u201d, no-AI-allowed film festival for spring 2025, which \u201ccreates a tunnel for human artists through the theft-based, job-replacing AI destruction\u201d. And in the year since the dual actors and writers\u2019 strikes secured landmark protections against the use of generative AI to replace jobs or steal likenesses, numerous non-protected instances of AI have drawn attention and scorn online. Concerns about job and quality loss surrounded AI-generated images in A24 promotional posters for the film Civil War, interstitials in the horror film Late Night with the Devil and a fake band poster in True Detective: Night Country. The alleged use of AI-generated archival photos in the Netflix documentary What Jennifer Did reignited discussions about documentary ethics first sparked by similar outcry over three lines of AI-generated narration to mimic Anthony Bourdain in the 2021 film Roadrunner. And that\u2019s not to mention all of the bemoaning of disposable AI filler content \u2013 or \u201cslop\u201d, as the parlance goes \u2013 clogging up our social media feeds. Taken together, the burgeoning use of generative AI in media can feel overwhelming \u2013 before the ink is dry on any new proclamation about it, the ground has shifted again. On an individual level, film artists are figuring out whether to embrace the technology now, how to use it and where their craft is headed. It has already rendered dubbing and translation work nearly obsolete. Visual effects artists, perennially on the bleeding edge of new technology for Hollywood, are already working with machine learning and some generative AI, particularly for pre-production visualizations and workflows. \u201cFrom an artist\u2019s perspective, we\u2019re all trying to get ahead of the game and play with open source tools that are available,\u201d said Kathryn Brillhart, a cinematographer and director whose credits include The Mandalorian, Black Adam and Fallout. Both Geduldick and Brillhart noted numerous limitations on the use of generative AI in film projects at this point \u2013 for one, the security of these platforms, especially for big studios worried about leaks or hacks. There\u2019s the legal liability and ethics of the current generative AI models, which to date have trained on scraped data. \u201cSome studios are like, \u2018We don\u2019t even feel comfortable using gen AI in storyboards and concept art, because we don\u2019t want a hint of any theft or licensing issues to come through in the final,\u2019\u201d said Brillhart. Studio films that do employ AI have limited uses and a clear data trail \u2013 in the case of Zemeckis\u2019s Here, the new de-aging and face replacement tech, designed by the AI firm Metaphysic and the Hollywood agency CAA, uses the faces of Hanks and Wright, famous actors who have signed on to the roles, to play characters over the course of 50 years. \u201cI\u2019ve always been attracted to technology that helps me to tell a story,\u201d Zemeckis said in 2023 of his decision to use Metaphysic. \u201cWith Here, the film simply wouldn\u2019t work without our actors seamlessly transforming into younger versions of themselves. Metaphysic\u2019s AI tools do exactly that, in ways that were previously impossible!\u201d And then there\u2019s the output of generative AI, which often plunges deep into the uncanny valley and leaves much to be desired. (Or, in the words of the AI skeptic David Fincher, \u201cit always looks like sort of a low-rent version of Roger Deakins\u201d). Geduldick, who has integrated AI into his workflow, sees current generative AI models as more \u201cassistive\u201d than truly imitative of human art. \u201cAre they implementing generative models that are going to speed up both the business and the creative side of what we\u2019re doing? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that there is no generative model out there today that doesn\u2019t get touched by artistic hands to get it to the next level. That is for the foreseeable future.\u201d Still, like the digital revolution before it, the one certainty about generative AI is that it will change the field of visual effects \u2013 making pre-visualization cheaper and more efficient, streamlining tedious processes, shaping storyboard design. As the work shifts, \u201cI think everybody needs to pivot,\u201d said Geduldick. \u201cThe craft has gone from hand-making models to using a mouse to now using text and using your brain in different ways,\u201d said Brillhart. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen is more of a forced learning curve,\u201d she added. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be growing pains, for sure.\u201d On the documentary side, generative AI opens new opportunities for nonfiction storytelling, though also threatens trust. \u201cAll technology has a kind of a dual moral purpose. And it\u2019s up to us to interrogate the technology to find the way to use it for good,\u201d said David France, an investigative journalist and film-maker whose 2020 documentary Welcome to Chechnya is one of a handful in recent years to employ generative AI as an anonymization device. The film, which follows the state-sanctioned persecution of LGBTQ+ people in the Russian republic, used AI to map actors\u2019 faces over real subjects who faced harrowing violence. France and his team tried several different methods to get around risking exposure; nothing worked cinematically, until trying the equivalent of deepfake technology, though with multi-step processes of consent and clear limitations. \u201cWe realized that we had an opportunity to really empower the people whose stories we were telling, to tell their stories directly to the audience and be faithful in their kind of emotional presentation,\u201d said France. The film-makers Reuben Hamlyn and Sophie Compton employed a similar technique for the subjects of their film Another Body, who were the victims of nonconsensual, deepfake pornography. Their main subject, \u201cTaylor\u201d, communicates through a digital veil \u2013 like deepfakes, an AI-generated face that interprets her real expressions through different features. Along with demonstrating the convincing, uncanny power of the technology that someone used to target Taylor, the AI translated \u201cevery minute facial gesture\u201d, said Hamlyn. \u201cThat emotional truth is retained in a way that is impossible even with silhouetting.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s such an important tool in empowering people to share their story,\u201d he added. Crucially, both Welcome to Chechnya and Another Body clue their audiences to the technology through implicit or explicit tells. That\u2019s in line with the best practices put forth by the Archival Producers Alliance, to avoid what has landed other films in hot water \u2013 namely Roadrunner, whose use of AI was revealed in the New Yorker after the film\u2019s release. The group also encourages documentary film-makers to rely on primary sources whenever possible; to think through algorithmic biases produced by the model\u2019s training data; to be as intentional with generative AI as they would with re-enactments; and consider how synthetic material, released in the world, could cloud the historical record. \u201cWe never say don\u2019t do it,\u201d said Jenkins, the APA member, but instead \u201cthink about what you\u2019re saying when you use this new material and how it will come across to your audience. There is something really special about the human voice and the human face, and you want to engage with [generative AI] in a way that is intentional and doesn\u2019t fall into some sort of manipulation.\u201d That line between human and machine is perhaps the most fraught one in Hollywood at the moment, in flux and uncertain. Compton, the co-director of Another Body, sees the emotionally loaded debates around AI as a series of smaller, more manageable questions involving pre-existing industry issues. \u201cThere are genuinely existential aspects of this discussion, but in terms of film and AI, we\u2019re not really talking about those things,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about killer robots. What we are talking about is consent, and what is the dataset that\u2019s being used, and whose jobs are on the line if this is adopted massively.\u201d Geduldick, an optimist on the assistive uses of generative AI, nevertheless sees a gap between its day-to-day applications, tech companies\u2019 lofty rhetoric, and \u201csoulless\u201d AI content produced for content\u2019s sake. Companies such as OpenAI \u2013 whose chief technology officer recently said generative AI might eliminate some creative jobs, \u201cbut maybe they shouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place\u201d \u2013 have \u201crepeatedly shown in their public-facing interviews or marketing that there\u2019s a disconnect [in] understanding what creatives actually do,\u201d he said. \u201cFilm-making is a collaborative thing. You are hiring loads of talented artists, technicians, craftspeople to come together and create this vision that the writers, director, showrunners and producers have thought up.\u201d For now, according to Geduldick, the \u201chype outweighs the practical applications\u201d of generative AI, but that does not obviate the need for regulation from the top, or for guidelines for those already using it. \u201cThe potential for it to be cinematic is really great,\u201d said France. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet that we\u2019ve seen anybody solve the ethical problem of how to use it.\u201d In the meantime, film-making, both feature and nonfiction, is at a fluid, amorphous crossroads. Generative AI is here \u2013 part potential, part application, part daunting, part exciting and, to many, a tool. There will likely be more AI film festivals, more backlash, more and more AI content creation \u2013 for better or for worse. There are already whole AI-generated streaming services, should you choose to generate your own content. How the human element will fare remains an open question \u2013 according to a recent Deloitte study, a surprising 22% of Americans thought generative AI could write more interesting TV shows or movies than people. The only certainty, at this point, is that AI will be used, and the industry will change as a result. \u201cThis will be in films that are coming out,\u201d said Jenkins. \u201cSo hold on to your seats.\u201d"

            "content": "JD Vance gave his first major address as Donald Trump\u2019s running mate on Wednesday as Republicans turned their focus to foreign policy during the third day of the Republican national convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Vance was preceded by Donald Trump Jr and introduced by his wife, Usha. The theme for Wednesday \u2013 \u201cMake America Strong Once Again\u201d \u2013 came amid internal divisions on how to handle the war in Ukraine. Earlier this year, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, only narrowly passed a bill to provide additional funding for Ukraine over the loud objection of some Republicans. Other speakers included Donald Trump Jr, the former Trump adviser Peter Navarro, who was released from prison on Wednesday after serving a four-month sentence for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena, North Dakota governor Doug Burgum \u2013 who was a top contender to be Trump\u2019s running mate \u2013 and Texas governor Greg Abbott. To a crowd of attendees \u2013 some holding signs reading \u201cMass deportation now!\u201d \u2013 Abbott declared: \u201cBiden has welcomed into our country rapists, murderers, even terrorists.\u201d He then led the crowd in a chant of: \u201cSend them back!\u201d Abbott noted his repeated act of sending buses of immigrants to sanctuary cities and vowed the buses \u201cwill continue to roll until we finally secure our border\u201d. Burgum later chastised the president with a different label: \u201cAt home, Biden is acting like a dictator.\u201d Representative Ronny Jackson and the former House speaker Newt Gingrich are also expected to address the convention. South Carolina representative Nancy Mace kicked off Wednesday night\u2019s speakers by telling the crowd: \u201cI\u2019m Nancy \u2018Don\u2019t Call Me Pelosi\u2019 Mace.\u201d Matt Gaetz, the Florida congressman, took to the stage on Wednesday with a brief but charged-up speech that took aim at Democrats, and in particular, at Kamala Harris. \u201cAppointing Kamala Harris to oversee the border is like appointing Bernie Madoff to oversee your retirement plan,\u201d said Gaetz, to jeers and applause. Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr\u2019s fiance and a former Fox News host, took the stage to claim that Biden\u2019s presidency has left America \u201cmore impoverished than anyone thought possible\u201d and that Trump \u201chanded Biden a booming economy\u201d. Tom Homan, Trump\u2019s former director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), came with \u201ca message to the millions of illegal aliens that Joe Biden has released into our country in violation of federal law. \u201cYou better start packing now. You\u2019re damn right.\u201d With some Democrats urging Joe Biden to step down amid concerns over the president\u2019s health and cognition following a devastating debate in early July, the possibility of Harris at the top of the Democrats\u2019 2024 presidential ticket seemed top of mind for Republican convention speakers. Gaetz also told attendees of Vance\u2019s vice presidential nomination: \u201cJD looks like a young Abraham Lincoln.\u201d His speech otherwise focused on Trump\u2019s economic agenda, and railing on voter ID laws. Ohio\u2019s East Palestine mayor Trent Conaway lauded Trump for his visit to the site of the freight train derailment, paying the former president compliments for how he treated residents. \u201cHis presence was genuine,\u201d Conaway said. Republicans also attacked Joe Biden over his handling of the US military\u2019s withdrawal from Afghanistan and the war between Israel and Gaza. The program devoted a lengthy segment to recounting the messy US military withdrawal from Afghanistan under Joe Biden three years ago, and in particular the 13 soldiers killed in an Islamic State terrorist attack at Kabul airport. It began with a video in which the families of the soldiers described their lost loved ones, then recounted how, when they met with Biden as their bodies arrived at a military base in Delaware. The families said Biden had not spoken the names of those killed and then came onstage to encourage viewers to vote Biden out of office. \u201cDespite our pleas for answers and accountability, they have pushed us away and tried to silence us,\u201d said Alicia Lopez, the mother of fallen soldier Corporal Hunter Lopez. The segment was followed by one on the polarizing war in Israel-Gaza. It started with a display of flags by fraternity brothers involved in counter-protests at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and ended with a speech by the parents of an American citizen being held hostage in Gaza. \u201cOmer is one of eight American hostages and one of 120 hostages. Still left in Gaza, citizens of 24 countries and five different religions, still held by Hamas, denied basic human needs, their lives threatened every day,\u201d Ronen Neutra said about his son, Omer Neutra before leading the crowd in a chant of \u201cBring them home!\u201d The focus on foreign policy comes after Republicans addressed crime and safety on Tuesday and on the economy on Monday. \u201cEach one of these has a theme, like last night was \u2018bend the knee and grovel\u2019 apparently,\u201d Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, said at a Democratic press conference in Milwaukee. \u201cAnd today is \u2018celebrate Russia day\u2019, I guess,\u201d he added. Walz also discussed the Democratic timeline for formally nominating Biden with a roll call vote amid pressure for him to drop out. \u201cWe need to get these things done. We need to get the roll call done,\u201d Walz said. \u201cBut it won\u2019t happen before the first of August.\u201d In the last speech before JD Vance, Donald Trump Jr \u2013 and briefly his daughter, 17-year-old Kai Madison Trump \u2013 addressed the crowd, and ramped up some of the more familiar rhetoric and attacks on Democrats. \u201cRemember Build Back Better?\u201d Trump Jr asked, referring to Biden\u2019s proposed overhaul of US social services. \u201cInstead, we got broke, bumbling Biden. Nothing is built, nothing is back and nothing is better.\u201d He then went into a typical dialogue about the country going backward, and nostalgia for an idyllic old-time America, while repeating \u201cculture war\u201d tropes. \u201cBridges are collapsing, our credibility is crumbling, and our money is worth less and less every single day,\u201d he said. \u201cMeanwhile, pro-crime district attorneys have turned our cities into giant crime zones. They\u2019ve turned criminals into victims, prosecutors into criminal defense attorneys and police into public enemies. Leftwing activists are pretending to be educators, teaching our kids that there are 57 genders, but they can\u2019t even define what a woman is.\u201d The four-day event has marked a full-on coronation for Trump, who has made his dramatic return to the campaign trail after surviving an assassination attempt over the weekend. It has also underscored the firm hold he has on the party. Haley and the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, who challenged Trump for the GOP nomination, both unequivocally backed Trump in speeches from the convention floor on Tuesday. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree with Trump 100% of the time to vote for him. Take it from me. I haven\u2019t always agreed with President Trump. But we agree more often than we disagree,\u201d Haley said in her remarks. Joan E Greve contributed reporting"

            "date": "2024-07-01T10:00:13Z",
            "content": "Since Hamas attacked southern Israel in October 2023, Joe Biden has shown nearly absolute support for Israel and its leaders. His administration has sent hundreds of weapons shipments that have enabled the Israeli military to sustain its brutal war on Gaza; used US veto power at the UN security council to block multiple resolutions demanding a ceasefire; and undermined the legitimacy of both the international court of justice and the international criminal court because of their criticisms of Israeli actions. Biden has been willing to destroy the fa\u00e7ade of an international rules-based order to protect Israel and the extremist government of its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. You would think that Netanyahu would show deep gratitude to an ally like Biden who demonstrates such unconditional backing for nearly nine months, often acting against his own and larger US interests. Instead, Netanyahu has consistently ignored and defied Israel\u2019s most important ally \u2013 and paid no price for it. Now the Israeli premier is openly mocking Biden and his administration: on 18 June, Netanyahu released an English-language video claiming the US was withholding weapons that Israel needs to continue its war. On 23 June, Netanyahu continued venting his contempt of Biden and overall US support, telling the Israeli cabinet that the Biden administration has dramatically decreased arms supplies in recent months. In fact, Biden suspended a single munitions shipment to Israel, consisting mostly of 2,000-lb bombs that can cause devastating casualties when dropped on population centers, as the Israeli military has consistently done in Gaza. But less than a week later, Biden changed course and resumed sending far more weapons than the single delivery he had delayed. In mid-May, the administration told Congress that it would proceed with more than $1bn in new arms deals for Israel, even as it became clear that Netanyahu had defied months of warnings from Biden and was moving ahead with a ground invasion of Rafah, Gaza\u2019s southernmost city, where more than 1 million Palestinians had taken shelter. Biden failed to use the most effective leverage he has over the Israeli government: stop US shipments of weapons and force Netanyahu to accept a ceasefire deal that the Biden administration has been trying to broker for months. Instead, Biden showed weakness and squandered any influence he could have had over Netanyahu and Israel\u2019s war, which has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians and brought Gaza to the brink of famine. Gaza has turned into Biden\u2019s most perplexing moral and foreign policy failure as president: why has he allowed Netanyahu to undermine him, and why does the Biden administration continue to respond so ineptly to a foreign leader who is far more dependent on the US than the other way around? Biden built his so-called \u201cbear hug\u201d strategy on the idea of keeping Netanyahu close from the start of the war \u2013 the US president literally hugged the Israeli leader during a visit to Tel Aviv in October. Biden and his aides argued that he could have more influence over Israel\u2019s actions by being supportive in public, while privately restraining Netanyahu and his extremist allies. But that approach never worked, and Netanyahu has been playing Biden since the beginning, as both friends and foes of the Israeli premier have tried to tell the US administration. Inexplicably, Biden hardly adjusted his strategy: he publicly criticized Netanyahu, but when the Israeli leader ignores or defies the US, Biden continues his unconditional aid with a steady flow of weapons and diplomatic cover to protect Israel from accusations of committing war crimes and genocide in Gaza. In fact, Netanyahu is not only showing a remarkable lack of gratitude to Biden with his latest complaints about delayed weapons shipments \u2013 the prime minister is trying to destroy Biden\u2019s ability to use US arms as leverage over Israel. And because Biden quickly wavered after suspending a single package of bombs in May, Netanyahu is succeeding. The Biden administration is no longer threatening to delay or cancel other arms deliveries to force Israel to change its tactics. Instead, the administration is spending its energy defending itself against Netanyahu\u2019s calculated claim that the US is not providing Israel with enough weapons. The Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, visited Washington last week and met with US officials who went through a line-by-line description of the hundreds of American arms shipments to Israel since October. To further rebut Netanyahu\u2019s accusation, the Biden administration for the first time publicly revealed the price tag of US support to Israel since the Hamas attack: $6.5bn in weapons and other security assistance, with nearly $3bn of that sum approved in May. And it\u2019s all paid for by US taxpayers, since Israel is the largest aggregate recipient of American foreign aid in the world, having received about $310bn (adjusted for inflation) since the state was founded in 1948. The Washington Post reported that an internal memo circulated to Democratic members of Congress explained that the single batch of heavy munitions that Biden suspended in May represented \u201cless than 1% of the total military support provided by the US to Israel since the beginning of this conflict\u201d. Still, Netanyahu is ignoring the massive deliveries of US weapons to Israel since October and successfully using that one delayed shipment to undermine Biden and question his commitment to the Jewish state. Biden and his aides are now worried that Netanyahu will use an address to a joint session of Congress on 24 July to attack the president once again \u2013 playing into the hands of House Republicans who invited Netanyahu to speak over the administration\u2019s objections. Democratic leaders in Congress initially resisted, but then they buckled and joined the Republican-led invitation. In 2015, Netanyahu used a similar speech in Congress to criticize the sitting US president, Barack Obama, and his administration\u2019s efforts at the time to negotiate a deal to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It seems Netanyahu will use his platform this time to attack Biden during a US presidential election for being insufficiently supportive of Israel\u2019s war \u2013 despite all evidence to the contrary. The prime minister and his allies are trying to undermine Biden and would prefer Donald Trump to be president again. It\u2019s been clear for months that Netanyahu does not want to end the Gaza war, and he has worked to sabotage US-brokered negotiations for a ceasefire and an agreement to release the remaining hostages held by Hamas. Once the war ends, Netanyahu and his far-right allies rightfully worry that they would confront early parliamentary elections and numerous investigations into the Israeli government\u2019s intelligence failures leading up to the Hamas attack. If he\u2019s forced out of power, Netanyahu would also face a long-delayed trial on bribery and other corruption charges for acts he allegedly committed during his earlier stints as prime minister. Netanyahu is a political survivor and he\u2019s willing to prolong a war to stay in power and avoid accountability. It\u2019s clear that Netanyahu would undermine Biden \u2013 and wider US interests \u2013 to save himself. All of this makes Biden\u2019s weak response and helplessness in confronting Netanyahu all the more baffling: why does the US president risk his own political future by continuing to support a foreign leader who is working to destabilize him? Biden and his administration have fallen into a kind of magical thinking: they demand that Netanyahu and his government stop a ruthless war, but continue providing the weapons and political cover that enable Israel to prolong the bloodshed.

            "date": "2024-07-22T12:02:19Z",
            "content": "Despite his recent memory lapses and malapropisms, Joe Biden has a store of knowledge about foreign policy and foreign leaders no other senior Democrat can match. Indeed, in the final days as he battled to retain his candidacy, his unparalleled experience was increasingly cited by his supporters as a reason in perilous times not to force him out. He himself has said he knows more about foreign policy than Henry Kissinger, and accolades to his qualities given by world leaders at the recent Nato summit in Washington were cited by the Biden team as a sign that Americans could not afford to lose him. European leaders had cherished his succession to the presidency in 2021 after Donald Trump, finding relief and truth in his promise the US was back. Without his careful consultations and weighing of the options, it is unlikely the west would have been able to respond as decisively as it did initially in terms of sanctions on Russia and military support to Ukraine after Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion. But now there may be a long period as a lame duck president in which all his decisions are set against his cognitive ability. But diplomats had sensed his star had anyway been waning, including his ability to articulate to Americans the need to defend Ukraine. The sense he is not prosecuting foreign policy arguments domestically with sufficient vigour has become a mainstay of European diplomatic discourse. His performance at the recent G7 summit in Italy raised eyebrows, and gradually some of his instincts have come to be seen as a product of a specific bygone era. He has become entrapped as well as freed by his knowledge and depth of experience. Biden took office after more than 30 years on the Senate foreign relations committee. By the time he took on the presidency he had a list of overseas contacts unmatched by any predecessor since George HW Bush, also a former two-term vice-president who spearheaded White House diplomatic assignments in the role. Biden has visited Ukraine many times, met Xi Jinping in Beijing, and looked into the eyes of Putin and declared he is a man without a soul. He has known Benjamin Netanyahu for 40 years. His experience also led him to believe in the power of personal rapport in foreign policy. His national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, once said: \u201cHe frequently says all foreign policy is personal, that personal relationships with leaders really matter.\u201d That experience has led to a willingness sometimes to overrule military commanders, diplomatic experts and others. \u201cHe\u2019s got fluency on foreign policy that gives him confidence \u2013 he knows he can win the argument,\u201d said Senator Chris Murphy, adding: \u201cIt allows him to act with boldness and confidence.\u201d Sometimes that boldness led to mistakes, including his handling of the US departure from Afghanistan and a reluctance to supply Ukraine with equipment quickly. So Kamala Harris, if she is elected, will be a downgrade in terms of knowledge of foreign affairs and foreign leaders, even after what would be an intensive autumn apprenticeship. That does not mean she is a novice. She has been slowly building her foreign policy portfolio, speaking in Britain at an AI conference organised by Rishi Sunak. She attended the 2023 Asean summit in Biden\u2019s stead. For three years in succession she led the US delegation to the Munich Security Conference, in what was clearly an attempt to broaden her knowledge and introduce her to Europe. At the last conference she had to respond to the news of the death of Alexei Navalny, and sent a message back home that \u201cisolation is not insulation\u201d. It was a message of continuity with Biden that she will have to deploy in the months ahead with greater force than the president can now muster. Several ex-Biden staffers have said they are optimistic that she can chart her own policy on Gaza, and that the president is caught in a time warp about an Israeli polity that no longer exists. In early March, Harris made a speech calling for a six-week \u201ctemporary ceasefire\u201d long before Biden publicly said so. Harris has also expressed sympathy for pro-Palestine student protesters, saying they were \u201cshowing exactly what the human emotion should be, as a response to Gaza\u201d, though she added she did not \u201cwholesale endorse their points\u201d. She has said clearly that too many Palestinians have been killed, and shown herself more sensitive to the protests in swing states. The chance for a mild reset exists that would take her closer to the European mainstream position on the Gaza conflict. Her chief foreign policy adviser, Philip Gordon, is a Washington veteran who has specialised in both Middle Eastern and European politics, and throughout has been sceptical of US efforts to secure regime change in the Middle East or impose democracy in countries such as Saudi Arabia. Unusually, his PhD was in French Gaullist security policy, and he initially joined the Obama administration as assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs before moving to the national security council staff specialising in the Middle East. He differed from his boss in believing limited strikes against Syria after its use of chemical weapons would be effective and justified, and was a strong supporter of the nuclear agreement with Iran. Given the learning curve Harris is on, Gordon becomes the man on whom she will have to rely as the Biden and Harris teams try to find a way to work alongside one another."

            "title": "Tuesday briefing: What David Lammy\u2019s Middle East visit says about Labour\u2019s foreign policy plans",
            "date": "2024-07-16T05:54:27Z",
            "content": "Good morning. A few months before the election, David Lammy outlined his vision for Britain\u2019s role on the international stage under a Labour government: \u201cprogressive realism\u201d, or \u201cthe pursuit of ideals without delusions about what is achievable\u201d. Just over a week into his tenure as foreign secretary, we have our first concrete indications of how he intends to operate those principles in practice. On a visit to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories over the last couple of days, his first international trip as foreign secretary, Lammy says he is sending a clear message: \u201cWe need an immediate ceasefire, the immediate release of all hostages, the protection of civilians, unfettered access to aid in Gaza and a pathway towards a two-state solution\u201d. But the image of the new foreign secretary shaking Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s hand in the aftermath of two attacks on the Gaza Strip that killed at least 120 people \u2013 many of them civilians taking refuge in a camp for displaced people \u2013 has caused considerable anger. The question that follows: is Lammy taking a risk with the left in order to better promote a peaceful resolution? Or is his supposed break with the Conservatives\u2019 foreign policy more a matter of rhetoric than action? Today\u2019s newsletter, with Olivia O\u2019Sullivan, director of the UK in the World Programme at Chatham House, explains what we already know about Lammy\u2019s approach to the conflict in Gaza, and what is still to be revealed. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Republican national convention | Donald Trump named JD Vance, the Ohio senator who was once one of his fiercest critics and called him \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201d, as his running mate at the Republican national convention on Monday. Trump, wearing a bandage over his wounded ear, shook hands with Vance in his first public appearance since the assassination attempt against him. US politics | A Florida judge appointed by Donald Trump has dismissed the case against him for illegally retaining classified documents, ruling that the special counsel who brought the prosecution had been improperly appointed. The stunning decision, in defiance of precedent going back to the Watergate era, is likely to be appealed. UK news | Rescue teams on the Spanish island of Tenerife have discovered the body of a young man in the area where the British teenager Jay Slater disappeared four weeks ago. Police said it appeared that the person could have died after an accidental fall from a cliff. UK-EU relations | Britain is taking its first steps towards forging closer trading links with the EU in meetings between the new business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, and international counterparts in Italy. Reynolds will say that the new UK government wants to foster a \u201ccloser, more mature relationship with our friends in the EU\u201d. Defence | Britain and its allies are facing a \u201cdeadly quartet\u201d of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea who are acting together against the west, the newly appointed head of Labour\u2019s defence review said. The comments from former Nato secretary general George Robertson reflect concerns that the grouping are increasingly sharing arms, components and military intelligence. In depth: \u2018It\u2019s important to focus on whether there is a shift in action, not just rhetoric\u2019 David Lammy\u2019s meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu was only one component of his trip to Israel \u2013 but in the context of the immense pressure that has been put on Labour from the left over its policy on Gaza, it is likely to be an indelible one. It\u2019s also true that Lammy has sought to signal a break with the Conservatives by emphasising the need for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d, language that is meant to sound stronger than his predecessor David Cameron\u2019s promise of \u201cdiplomatic leadership to reach a sustainable ceasefire\u201d. If that sounds like a distinction without a difference to the casual listener, it will have to be accompanied by more substantive measures to be credible. \u201cIn many ways, Labour\u2019s language in opposition was quite similar to the then government\u2019s,\u201d Olivia O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to focus on whether there is a shift in action, not just in emphasis or rhetoric.\u201d *** What message is Lammy seeking to send with this visit? As well as Netanyahu, Lammy has met with Israeli president Isaac Herzog, and Palestinian Authority prime minister Mohammad Mustafa. He also saw family members of hostages being held in Gaza who have ties to the UK and Palestinians living in the West Bank who have been affected by Israeli settler violence. He said that \u201cthe loss of life over the last few months \u2026 is horrendous\u201d and \u201chas to stop\u201d. And he said he would press Israeli leaders over conducting the war according to international humanitarian law, and on access for British aid trucks to Gaza. \u201cI\u2019m sure they think about how the image with Netanyahu looks to people,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201cBut Lammy and others around Labour have emphasised that their approach is dealing with the interlocutor you have, not the one you wish to have.\u201d *** How does that fit into Labour\u2019s broader foreign policy? Lammy has said he views his \u201cprogressive realism\u201d doctrine as an approach for a \u201cnewly dangerous and divided era\u201d that stands in contrast to \u201cthe reckless and gaffe-prone diplomacy of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak\u201d. In this Guardian piece, he adds that it means \u201crecognising that the UK\u2019s success depends on hard-headed realism about our own nation and the continent\u2019s security, not a nostalgic misremembering of what we used to be.\u201d (For a sceptical take on this approach, see this essay by international relations theorist Se\u00e1n Molloy.) \u201cLammy has signalled that his foreign policy will involve engaging with countries with whom we don\u2019t agree on everything to achieve results,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said. (Indeed, he also wrote: \u201cWe must shake the hands of those we need for peace.\u201d) \u201cLabour often splits, in broad terms, between people who do not want to engage diplomatically or otherwise with countries with whom we do not share values, and people who don\u2019t see that as a way to have influence in the world. The Middle East is really the first test of Lammy\u2019s approach and whether it will be accepted.\u201d *** Has pressure from pro-Gaza voters made any difference? One part of the backdrop to Lammy\u2019s visit, and Labour\u2019s policy on Gaza more generally, is the election of five independent candidates backed by The Muslim Vote (TMV), a campaign group opposed to Labour\u2019s approach over Gaza. TMV-backed candidates secured a strong showing or second place finishes in other constituencies as well. Labour\u2019s vote fell by an average of 11% in seats where more than 10% of the population are Muslim. (For more on the appeal of these independent candidates, see this excellent Prospect analysis by Imaan Irfan.) \u201cOf course they are concerned about that,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201cAnd this is a longer-term concern with a broad base of their support. But they have a very secure majority, and they are obviously a very long way from the next election. So I\u2019m loath to say that this one electoral cycle will direct policy.\u201d On the other hand, she added, \u201cthe UK tends to prioritise aligning with the US\u2019s position on this and other issues \u2013 that is sometimes less of a priority for other European countries.\u201d A \u201cprogressive realist\u201d approach, she added, might mean \u201cthinking about how this will affect our wider relations with states that are critical to any solution to the crisis \u2013 the US in particular.\u201d *** How might Labour\u2019s policy differ from the Conservatives? So early in Lammy\u2019s tenure, much of this remains hypothetical. O\u2019Sullivan points to three key areas that could indicate a direction of travel: funding for the Palestinian relief works agency Unrwa, the question of whether UK arms sales to Israel will continue, and whether the Conservative government\u2019s objection to prospective ICC warrants for the arrest of Netanyahu and other senior Israeli officials will be maintained. \u201cLammy has indicated he will have something to say about Unrwa in the coming days,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said. Barbara Woodward, the UK\u2019s envoy to the UN, has said Lammy is \u201cclosely considering\u201d whether to restore funding \u2013 a move that would be in line with most countries that withdrew it over Israeli allegations that it had been infiltrated by Hamas, allegations that have not been substantiated. Lammy urged the government to restore funding in April. Last month, Lammy said the UK would comply with an ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu. But yesterday the Israeli newspaper Maariv reported that Lammy had given assurances to Israel that the UK would maintain the last government\u2019s objection to the ICC\u2019s application for warrants. The human rights barrister Geoffrey Robinson meanwhile warned that Washington is putting pressure on the UK to lodge the objection, which he called a \u201clegal nonsense\u201d, writing: \u201cThe US is not a member of the ICC, and expects the UK to look after its interests there.\u201d On arms exports, \u201cLabour called for the publication of legal advice given to the government,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201cSo will they do that themselves? It isn\u2019t clear yet what they\u2019re going to do there.\u201d In May, Lammy said that if a Rafah offensive went ahead, the UK should suspend sales of weapons that could be used to prosecute it. *** Will anything Lammy does influence Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza? \u201cWe should be cautious of overstating the role that the UK government is going to have,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t influence. The UK has longstanding relationships with the Gulf states, and it can play a role in supporting shuttle diplomacy or convening discussions \u2013 supporting the progress of any proposal that involves the whole region. But it will only be part of the puzzle.\u201d Working to bring key regional actors together would be consistent with the last government\u2019s approach, she added. \u201cThey could also appoint an envoy to the Middle East \u2013 someone who is the point person, and pushes for more consistent and focused engagement.\u201d Above all, the question is how hard Lammy will push Israel if he feels that the UK\u2019s relationship with the US could be threatened. \u201cWe should not fail to recognise that the US will remain the UK\u2019s most essential ally, whoever occupies the White House,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPursuing ideals will be futile, without first guaranteeing our own security.\u201d It is very early days \u2013 but exactly what that means in practice may soon start to become clear. \u2022 This article was amended on 16 July 2024. An earlier version said the Israeli newspaper Maariv, in reporting that David Lammy had given assurances to Israel that the UK would maintain the previous government\u2019s objection to the ICC\u2019s warrants application, had taken a similar line to a Guardian article published on 8 July. In fact the Guardian article reported that the challenge was expected to be dropped.

            "title": "Rachel Reeves pursues political prize over \u00a322bn financial hole",
            "date": "2024-07-29T18:49:23Z",
            "content": "The basics of Rachel Reeves\u2019 Commons statement about her fiscal inheritance from the Conservatives were simple: there is a \u00a322bn financial hole that needs fixing. But there was a bigger picture being presented, and with it, a potentially invaluable political prize. At the heart of the chancellor\u2019s near 30-minute presentation to the Commons was a narrative that most MPs and some of the public will already be familiar with: we are having to make tricky decisions because the Tories left us a mess. The three and a half weeks since the change of government has already been punctuated by new ministers taking to the airwaves to say they are shocked \u2013 shocked! \u2013 at the state of their departmental budgets. Reeves\u2019 statement was the centrepiece, the culmination, of a carefully honed message. Such ideas are not easy to fix in public opinion, but if they settle they can be equally hard to shift. Successfully presenting much of Labour\u2019s work as a noble attempt to clear up after the Tories has obvious attractions, and an equally obvious example from recent history. When David Laws, the Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury under the coalition government, first arrived at his desk after the 2010 election he found a now infamous note. In keeping with playful Treasury tradition, Gordon Brown\u2019s chief secretary, Liam Byrne, scribbled a message for his then unknown successor: \u201cDear chief secretary, I\u2019m afraid there is no money. Kind regards \u2013 and good luck! Liam.\u201d This was a joke from a ministerial team who had helped the UK pull through the 2008 banking crisis. But in a ruthless and vastly effective piece of political messaging, the coalition \u2013 and just about every Conservative minister since \u2013 pretended it was serious. Reeves\u2019 attempt to blame the Conservatives for spending cuts now, and possible tax rises in the autumn, is both a tribute to the success of that tactic and a piece of revenge served utterly cold, 14 years on. Much as the 2010 note gave political cover for austerity, the idea of government books riddled with uncosted projects and illusory savings might also provide leeway for Keir Starmer\u2019s government, heavily hemmed in by its pledge to not pull the main fiscal revenue levers of income tax, national insurance or VAT. The political tables had already turned since 2010. Many voters deserted the Conservatives because of a sense they had become chaotic, created by having five prime ministers in eight years and reinforced in particular by Liz Truss\u2019s 45-day tenure and her disastrous mini-budget. Getting voters to now believe that the Tories effectively gave up on tough decisions, because they knew they would lose the election and it would thus not be their problem, could be even more resonant. Such ideas are often best expressed as vignettes, and Reeves repeated several, including the image of the recommended 5.5% pay award for teachers sitting for weeks, untouched, on the desk of Gillian Keegan, the outgoing education secretary. All this is a tricky political manoeuvre, not least because the Conservatives can point to numerous examples of Reeves saying before the election that she knew exactly what she faced. There is a brutal political battle to come, illustrated in the Commons on Monday as Jeremy Hunt, the shadow chancellor, accused Reeves of wanting to \u201cblame the last Conservative government for tax rises and project cancellations she\u2019s been planning all along\u201d. Reeves was ready, and is a more pugnacious politician than her public image as a cerebral economist might indicate. \u201cI can understand why members are angry,\u201d she said after Tory MPs shouted \u201cShame!\u201d as she announced the scrapping of a planned cap on social care. \u201cI am angry, too. The previous government let people down.\u201d However the narrative lands, there are politically tricky times to come for the government. Announcing cuts is one thing. It will feel all the more real when millions of pensioners don\u2019t get a winter fuel payment, a promised bypass isn\u2019t built, or a new local hospital never gets from blueprint to reality. All this is arguably inevitable. What is on offer for Labour, if their narrative lands with the public, is being able to fight the election on the basis of \u201cDon\u2019t let the Conservatives wreck the public finances again.\u201d It could be a major advantage \u2013 but only if it works."

            "date": "2024-07-31T06:00:17Z",
            "content": "Don\u2019t think you need to be rich Many in the industry say that a common misconception about financial advice is that it is only for people who are well-off. April Leeson, an adviser at the independent financial adviser (IFA) firm The Private Office, says: \u201cUsually, the people that come to us for help are those that are at a crossroads in their life or have experienced a change in circumstances, such as with their career or retirement, the death of a loved one and/or receiving a lump sum from inheritance, a redundancy or a property sale, or simply those who want to future-proof their money for themselves or their families.\u201d That said, this can be a pricey business, and the costs involved will rule it out for some. Plus, advisers do sometimes refuse customers who do not have a lot of money to invest. The consumer group Which? says you can get financial advice on a portfolio of a few thousand pounds, but finding an adviser willing to work with you \u201cmay prove a challenge\u201d. It quotes a survey showing that the number of IFAs prepared to work with clients with less than \u00a350,000 to invest has halved from 53% in 2019 to 25% in 2023. Understand the options People working in this sector call themselves by various names, such as financial adviser, financial planner or wealth manager. Financial planners often say they look at the bigger picture and take a more holistic approach than other advisers. The adviser\u2019s chosen title may reflect their specialism: for example, investment adviser, pension adviser or mortgage adviser. \u201cWhatever they might be called, what all financial advisers in the UK do have in common is that they\u2019re regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority,\u201d the government-backed MoneyHelper website says. You can check if they are on the FCA\u2019s Financial Services Register. If an adviser deals with investments, pensions or retirement products, they will be classified as either \u201cindependent\u201d or \u201crestricted\u201d. IFAs can recommend products from firms across the whole market. Restricted ones may have limitations on the type of products they offer \u2013 maybe they just concentrate on pensions \u2013 the number of providers they are able to choose from, or both. So if you approach an adviser and it is not clear which type they are, ask them. If they are restricted, ask how many providers they have access to. There are minimum qualifications that all financial advisers need to have. At the very least, they must have completed a level 4 diploma in financial advice recognised by the FCA. Many will have achieved more than that, such as the certified financial planner and chartered financial planner qualifications. Ask around A personal recommendation from a family member or a friend is one of the best ways to find a financial adviser. However, you should still do your own research \u2013 for example, checking Trustpilot and Google reviews \u2013 to get the latest on how people rate the firm and any changes that might have taken place, such as the business being taken over or key people leaving. Some employers, workplace pension schemes and trade unions have link-ups with particular advisers, so you may want to approach one of those, and ideally talk to co-workers who have used them. Search online There are various websites you can try. Unbiased works with more than 27,000 qualified financial professionals \u2013 you answer a few questions, then it will match you with an adviser. Or you can use its free directory to find someone. VouchedFor has almost 12,000 advisers on its site and shares verified reviews of advisers by their clients. You can search for an adviser\u2019s name if they have been recommended, or look for ones in your area. Wayfinder helps people to find certified financial planners who are local to them. The Personal Finance Society, meanwhile, has a site that lets you find various types of adviser in your area, including chartered financial planners. Compare costs Advisers offer different options when it comes to paying for their services. Many offer an initial meeting that is free of charge. After that, it can really vary, so make sure you know exactly what you are signing up to. Those recommending things such as investments can\u2019t receive commission from the products they sell. An adviser may charge an initial fee, then an ongoing fee that may be yearly or monthly. This may be a percentage of your investment or a flat fee. Other charging options include an hourly rate, which MoneyHelper says can vary from \u00a375 to \u00a3350, or a set fee for a specific job such as a pension transfer. Which? suggests getting quotes from three financial advisers, adding: \u201cDon\u2019t take the fee the adviser quotes as gospel. If you think you should be paying less, discuss it with them.\u201d VouchedFor gives some examples of what you might expect to pay: someone wanting help investing \u00a350,000 with ongoing advice might be looking at a total cost over five years of \u00a33,239, of which \u00a31,244 is paid upfront. For creating a financial plan with \u00a3100,000 of investments and ongoing service, the equivalent figures would be \u00a37,880 and \u00a32,849. For consolidating three pension pots worth \u00a3500,000 with ongoing advice, it would be \u00a327,785 and \u00a38,705. It has been suggested that for advice on pension or retirement planning, you may be looking at needing up to nine hours with someone. But people whose affairs are simple won\u2019t need that long. If you feel that you don\u2019t need face-to-face advice, an online or phone-based service will probably be cheaper. With face-to-face advice, London and the south-east will probably be pricier than other parts of the country. Get help paying If you think you may not be able to meet the full cost of getting advice, you may be able to get help. The UK pensions advice allowance allows many people in defined contribution pension schemes to take up to \u00a3500 out of their pot tax free to pay for retirement advice. You can do this up to three times in your lifetime (no more than once in a tax year). However, you need to check your pension provider will let you access the allowance, as not all do. Some companies offer access to financial advice as part of their employee benefits packages, sometimes at a reduced cost. The government\u2019s free Pension Wise service may be able to help if you are 50 or over and have a defined contribution pension pot (personal or workplace). It provides \u201cguidance\u201d \u2013 not regulated financial advice \u2013 face to face, over the phone and online. An appointment typically lasts about 60 minutes and will go through the options on taking money from your pots, the tax implications and so on \u2013 but it won\u2019t recommend any financial products or providers or tell you what to do with your cash. After your chat, you will get a document summarising your options and next steps. If you are under 50 or only have a defined benefit pension, you probably won\u2019t be able to have a Pension Wise appointment but it can still offer help. To find out more and to book an appointment, go to the Pension Wise webpage. There are only a limited number of face-to-face appointment slots. Organisations such as Citizens Advice and some charities also offer financial guidance. Go green Lots of financial firms and products claim to be ethical, but with things such as investments, there\u2019s very little agreement as to what constitutes a \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201csustainable\u201d fund. If you want to make a positive change with your money, you will need to talk to the adviser about what that means to you. There are lots of ethical advisers out there. Sites such as Unbiased let you request someone who specialises in green or ethical finance. The ethical finance website Good With Money has named its \u201ctop nine\u201d for 2024. They are: Jeannie Boyle at London-based EQ Investors; Path Financial, based in East Sussex; BlueSphere, based in Wigan; Surrey-based Switchfoot Wealth; Castlefield, based in Manchester; Tanya Pein at London-based In2 Planning; Ethical Futures, based in Edinburgh; Cleona Lira at London-based Conscious Money; and Amber River True Bearing, based in Lancashire. Do it yourself? There are lots of free or low-cost resources that you can use to create an investment portfolio. The websites of investment firms such as Hargreaves Lansdown carry articles and information about the firms and funds that they like. But this is not the same as tailored advice. The Private Office\u2019s Leeson says it\u2019s \u201ca bit like having a fitness goal \u2013 you can do it yourself if you are knowledgable and disciplined enough, but having a professional to guide you and help develop a plan based on your specific needs will likely produce a better outcome that can stand the test of time\u201d."

            "date": "2024-07-14T12:00:56Z",
            "content": "OpenAI whistleblowers have urged the US financial watchdog to investigate non-disclosure agreements at the startup after claiming the contracts included restrictions such as requiring employees to seek permission before contacting regulators. Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) typically bar an employee from sharing company information with outside parties but a group of whistleblowers are arguing that OpenAI\u2019s agreements could have led to workers being punished for raising concerns about the company to federal authorities. San Francisco-based OpenAI is the developer of the ChatGPT chatbot and a key player in the artificial intelligence boom, which has been accompanied by expressions of concern from experts about the potential dangerous capabilities of the technology. \u201cGiven the well-documented potential risks posed by the irresponsible deployment of AI, we urge the Commissioners to immediately approve an investigation into OpenAI\u2019s prior NDAs, and to review current efforts apparently being undertaken by the company to ensure full compliance with SEC rules,\u201d the letter to Gary Gensler, the chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said. The letter from whistleblower representatives was sent on 1 July and published by the Washington Post on Saturday after the news organisation obtained it from the office of the US senator Chuck Grassley. The letter states that a formal complaint has been filed with the SEC alleging \u201csystemic\u201d legal violations at the startup. \u201cArtificial intelligence is rapidly and dramatically altering the landscape of technology as we know it,\u201d Grassley told Reuters, adding that \u201cOpenAI\u2019s policies and practices appear to cast a chilling effect on whistleblowers\u2019 right to speak up and receive due compensation for their protected disclosures\u201d. The letter alleges that employees have been required to sign agreements that waive their federal rights to whistleblower compensation. The whistleblowers claim OpenAI\u2019s employment contracts, severance agreements and NDAs violate SEC rules. \u201cThere is an urgent need to ensure that employees working on this technology understand that they can raise complaints or address concerns to federal regulatory or law enforcement authorities,\u201d they wrote. The whistleblowers call on SEC commissioners to investigate OpenAI\u2019s past NDAs, which they argue broke the law by requiring employees to sign \u201cillegally restrictive\u201d contracts. The letter added that restrictive NDAs are \u201cparticularly egregious\u201d given the potential for advanced AI systems to threaten humanity. It urged the SEC to take four actions: to make OpenAI produce every NDA it has issued and ensure none of the signatories have had their rights affected; remind past and present OpenAI employees that they have the right to whistleblow; fine OpenAI for each improper NDA; and to order OpenAI to correct the \u201cchilling effect\u201d of its past practices. An OpenAI spokesperson said: \u201cOur whistleblower policy protects employees\u2019 rights to make protected disclosures. \u201cAdditionally, we believe rigorous debate about this technology is essential and have already made important changes to our departure process to remove non-disparagement terms.\u201d The SEC has been contacted for comment."

            "date": "2024-07-27T20:00:35Z",
            "content": "Car repossessions are rising sharply in Australia, in a sign of increasing financial distress that can have traumatic consequences on households, including robbing people of work opportunities. Automotive auction house Pickles describes a recent spike in the supply of repossessed vehicles as \u201csignificant\u201d, with numbers rising by 13% in the past six months and 11% over the last quarter. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Pickles attributes the rise to cost-of-living pressures and falling used car prices, which have hindered the ability of vehicle owners to refinance their fast-depreciating assets. Automotive arrears data from the banking sector also shows Australians are falling behind on their car repayments, with 90-plus day past due figures now at about twice the rate of two years ago, according to Westpac\u2019s most recent financial results. Serious delinquencies are a precursor to repossessions. Peter Esho, an economist who heads Sydney-based Esho Capital, said automotive arrears were a \u201cvery important discretionary lead indicator\u201d that showed the financial pain households were experiencing. \u201cPeople tend to delay the car payment or miss the car payment before the house payment,\u201d Esho said. \u201cThe home mortgage is now sucking a bigger component of spending and everything else is suffering. \u201cWith a car loan, they are fixed-loan periods and there is generally very little wriggle room to refinance.\u201d Australians have been grappling with years of surging living costs and lending rates, which have led to a major jump in the number of businesses collapsing, and people falling behind on repayments. The prolonged period of high mortgages and rents is pushing more people into financial stress, leaving less capacity to pay off other types of debt such as car loans. Car owners have also endured steep double-digit increases in insurance costs as well as elevated petrol prices. While some households may sacrifice their car loan in order to meet high mortgage rates or rental costs, automotive loans are still seen as a priority item given many people rely on vehicles to work. Social services provider UnitingCare describes car repossession as a \u201ctraumatic experience with lasting consequences\u201d. If the sale of a repossessed car does not pay off the full debt, the borrower will still be liable for any outstanding amount, as well as having their credit rating affected. The Australian car market has experienced a volatile period marked by pandemic supply constraints that have led to long wait times for popular models, which have also kept used car prices high. As supply constraints ease, used car prices have fallen quickly, ending the period of booming secondhand vehicle prices. This is good news for buyers, but bad news for those with auto loans. Rating agency Fitch notes that while auto arrears are still below pre-pandemic levels, the pace of increased delinquencies is rising quickly, with arrears \u201clikely to stay elevated due to ongoing pressures from inflation and stagnant real wage growth\u201d. This roughly mirrors home repossession data, however mortgage lenders typically allow customers more flexibility, which includes loan deferments, that can help mask the true extent of financial distress in the economy. Fraser Ronald, the chief commercial officer at Pickles, said that \u201cpeople will go to a lesser price point and what that means in terms of used cars is a smaller car, because they\u2019re cheaper\u201d. He said passenger cars, including sedans and hatchbacks, are in demand, which rubs against the strong appetite for SUVs that has been evident in recent years. James Voortman, the chief executive at the Australian Automotive Dealer Association, said consumers were turning to cheaper vehicles due to rising living costs, with competitively priced Chinese brands including LDV, Great Wall Motor, MG and Haval dramatically increasing market share in recent years. He said the strong pandemic demand for new vehicles was clearly easing. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing from dealers that this cost-of-living crisis is starting to bite and they are seeing a lot less people present in showrooms,\u201d Voortman said."

Stutchbury, 67, will be replaced next month by James Chessell, the former executive editor of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. Nine Entertainment\u2019s managing director of publishing, Tory Maguire, said Stutchbury had guided the Financial Review through enormous changes in technology and consumer behaviour. Journalists at the Financial Review \u2013 and the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald \u2013 face looming cuts of up to 90 jobs in the publishing division. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Earlier this month the company\u2019s chief executive, Mike Sneesby, announced 200 jobs would be cut from the company in an effort to save $30m due to the \u201ceconomic headwinds\u201d facing the media. The unionised mastheads are also facing industrial action by a workforce seething over the company\u2019s latest pay offer of 2.5% during bargaining for a new enterprise bargaining agreement (EBA). The Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance said journalists at the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, the Australian Financial Review, Brisbane Times and WAtoday would begin taking action through social media and calling for public support this week. \u201cMembers\u2019 anger is white hot that the job cuts will fall disproportionately upon the publishing division, which is profitable and productive,\u201d the acting director of MEAA media, Michelle Rae, said. On Monday afternoon staff voted unanimously to take industrial action on Friday for five days and to call on management to suspend executive and senior leadership bonuses and invest the savings into the newsrooms.

Chessell also worked for the Australian as a business media journalist and was part of a Financial Review team that won the 2014 Walkley award for business journalism. A former editor of the Australian, Stutchbury is the Financial Review\u2019s longest-serving editor or editor-in-chief, and will return in a writing role as editor-at-large later in the year. In 2014 he apologised to Western Australian readers of the national paper for a set of front-page headlines which read in part: \u201cWorld is Fukt\u201d. The headline ran in error in the WA edition of the special Anzac Day weekend edition of the AFR. The edition is a four-day special on sale for the Anzac Day long weekend.

            "date": "2024-07-23T04:00:04Z",
            "content": "The northern hemisphere has had a large number of intense wildfires in the first half of summer, carrying vast amounts of smoke across Eurasia and North America. Research by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (Cams) showed large-scale and intense wildfires had been developing throughout the late spring and summer, with numerous fires burning in Canada, Alaska and eastern Russia. These wildfires are generally caused by long periods of hot and dry conditions in areas of high vegetation, and have resulted in increased carbon and smoke emissions. Smoke has also begun to extend much farther north, reaching across the Arctic Ocean to the high Arctic. Emissions from Russian wildfires in June and July were higher than for the preceding two years, and fires in the region of Amur Oblast led to the estimated release of 17.2 megatonnes of carbon for the two-month period, the highest in 22 years. Canada has also had some of its highest totals on record, with total carbon emissions of 11.1 megatonnes and 13.2 megatonnes for British Columbia and Alberta respectively across June and July. Mark Parrington, a senior scientist at Cams, said: \u201cWe have been closely monitoring boreal fires in Cams over a number of years and noted some particularly extreme wildfire emissions and atmospheric impacts during that time, particularly in Canada, eastern Russia and the Arctic.\u201d Increasing wildfire activity is a major factor in these rising smoke emissions. Guillermo Rein, a professor of fire science in the department of mechanical engineering at Imperial College London, said: \u201cIn recent years the fire season is expanding, starting earlier and lasting longer. But it\u2019s not just the fact the wildfire season is widening, it\u2019s also that the intensity of wildfire season is becoming unprecedented.\u201d According to official Russian figures, the number of wildfires this year has decreased by 30% compared with the previous year, but the area burnt is 50% larger, highlighting the intensity of the wildfires. These increased smoke emissions have led to very high levels of air pollution and can lead to various health complications. \u201cIn the short term, the most obvious complications are to respiratory systems, proving particularly dangerous for people that have underlying conditions like asthma, heart disease and lung disease,\u201d says Dr Marina Romanello, a research fellow at the UCL Institute for Global Health. \u201cHowever, as the incidence of wildfires is increasing, people are being repeatedly exposed to acute levels of wildfire related air pollution, increasing their risk of developing chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease and cancer.\u201d Concentrations of very small harmful particulates in the smoke, known as PM2.5, have been found to be several times higher than the World Health Organization\u2019s recommended 24-hour mean exposure threshold across a widespread region that includes eastern Mongolia, north-eastern China and northern Japan. Romanello said: \u201cPM2.5 particles are \u2026 able to go very deep into the lungs, past the lung-blood barrier, and enter the bloodstream, making these high levels of smoke emissions particularly concerning.\u201d While 2024\u2019s estimated wildfire carbon emissions are very high so far, the season is still well short of the catastrophic 2023 season, when much of North America experienced record high levels of PM2.5. Rein said: \u201cWe don\u2019t think this season is going to break any records but it\u2019s a strange situation where we\u2019ve been seeing the worst in the records for so long that when you see it you think things are OK, when actually it\u2019s still pretty bad.\u201d"

            "content": "A Russian chef who has lived in France for 14 years has been arrested on suspicion of plotting with a foreign power to stage \u201clarge scale\u201d acts of \u201cdestabilisation\u201d during the Olympic Games in Paris. The 40-year-old man was arrested during a raid of his apartment in central Paris on Sunday where a document linked to an elite Russian special forces unit operating under the command of the FSB, an heir to the KGB, was reportedly found. A judicial investigation has been opened into allegations of sharing \u201cintelligence with a foreign power with a view to provoking hostilities in France,\u201d a crime punishable by 30 years of imprisonment. The alleged plot is not believed to have been terror related. The man, who has not been named, was indicted on this charge on the same day and placed in pretrial detention. An ambitious opening ceremony of Paris 2024 will be staged on the banks of the Seine on Friday evening and there has long been concern that Russia could seek to meddle in events. Gerald Darmanin, France\u2019s interior minister, said that \u201cother Russian individuals\u201d had been arrested amid evidence at attempts to spread disinformation ahead of the Games. \u201cWe think very strongly that he was going to organise operations of destabilisation, interference, spying,\u201d Darmanin told BFM television. \u201cHe\u2019s now in the justice system which will be able to confirm the suspicions of the police.\u201d Of other alleged attempts to spread disinformation, the minister added: \u201cWe saw a video which purports to be someone from Hamas... who announces an attack in the next few days and comes because France is going to welcome Israeli athletes. We\u2019re not sure, but it looks like it is fake and has been spread by pro-Kremlin and pro-Russian channels.\u201d Prosecutors in Paris said the search of the apartment of the Russian national detained on Sunday had been carried out at the request of the French interior ministry. According to briefings given to the French media, agents found evidence suggesting the man was preparing a \u201clarge-scale project\u201d that could have had \u201cserious\u201d consequences during the three weeks of games. The French newspaper, Le Monde, reported that the intelligence services had listened into a call two months ago between the individual and a Russian intelligence services handler in which the suspect had stated that \u201cthe French are going to have an opening ceremony like there has never been before\u201d. No details have been provided as to the nature of the alleged conspiracy to destabilise the games. The paper reported that the detained man had been trained as a chef in Paris and that he had participated in Russian reality and cooking shows. He had described himself on his CV as a \u201cprivate chef\u201d. He first arrived in France in 2010 and spent some time in Courchevel, a ski resort popular with the Russian elite, where he worked in a Michelin starred restaurant, before leaving for Paris in 2012. According to emails dating from September 2012, and seen by Le Monde, the suspect had told his landlady, named by the paper as Viviane, that he was returning to Moscow to work as an official in the Russian government. But he took part in a civic training day, a mandatory integration step in France, in April 2013. The intelligence services had tracked him for months. They picked up on his alleged phone call to his handler in May at a time when he was returning from a trip to Istanbul to his home in Paris. He was turned away from his flight due to excessive alcohol consumption and instead returned via Bulgaria, at which point the conversation about the Olympics opening ceremony was monitored, according to Le Monde. At 6am on Sunday, police officers from the elite \u2018research and intervention brigade (BRI), called in by the General Directorate of Internal Security, raided the suspect\u2019s home on Rue Saint-Denis on the right bank of the Seine. It is claimed that the police found \u201cdocuments of diplomatic interest\u201d among his possessions. Last month Microsoft said Russia was seeking to undermine the Olympics with the creation of fake websites replicating authentic French media outlets and the use of artificial intelligence to fuel concern about violence and terrorism. Darmanin, said this week that authorities had screened over one million people. \u201cWe are here to ensure that sport is not used for espionage, cyberattacks or to criticise and sometimes even lie about France and the French,\u201d he said."

George\u2019s belief in books and the goodness of people was unwavering. \u201cThe business of books is the business of life,\u201d he said. Books weren\u2019t going anywhere. George was right. Five years later, our shop is still here, despite the challenges of the cost-of-living crisis, and of course, Covid. Though there were times during the pandemic when things seemed impossible, it was how we truly got to know our community, their dogs, their back yards, their homemade jams \u2013 from lots of phone and email recommendations to passing books through doorways, or deliveries to doorsteps often 10 minutes after being ordered. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning We made it our mission to keep the shop alive, and in some ways our bookshop was built during this time. After life overseas it showed us the power of community and the undying love people have for books and for bookshops. It seemed like our community decided they wanted us to survive, and I wanted to repay that faith and commitment by doing whatever I could to get them their books, like driving 35 minutes to deliver a $12 paperback to an excited kid. For those in despair at the downfall of Booktopia, never fear: bookshops are still here. The ones down the street, around the corner, the one you drive past or walk past, or look at online. Through the rise and fall of the Borders and the chains, the Amazons and ebooks, the Booktopias and Big Ws, the local bookshop has struggled through, for the passion and joy of putting the right book in the right person\u2019s hand. They\u2019ll be here after the next existential threat too, whatever that might be. Any loss of a bookshop is devastating \u2013 even Booktopia, if it does close down. I\u2019m sure most booksellers agree that no matter what, the priority is that people have access to books. And I\u2019m sad for the jobs lost and concerned for publishers that will suffer as a result. But I\u2019m not sad to see the model go. Large-scale, faceless, algorithm-based bookselling is the antithesis to the human experience of going into a bookshop, especially an independent one that has been lovingly curated by people who care deeply about books. And it\u2019s more than that. A local independent bookshop is part of the cultural capital of a town or city. It is a meeting place of ideas and discussion. It promotes creativity, art and storytelling. It donates actual money to local schools, writing groups, theatre groups, even sporting clubs. The owners more than likely live in the same area. They are part of the community. As the world grows more hostile, binary and inflamed, we look to books to remind us of life\u2019s complexity and grey areas, of wonder, learning and expansion. They open our minds, soften our hearts, ground us, connect us and free us. I refuse to believe books and good bookshops will ever die. They are a human rather than commercial interest. As long as we\u2019re here, we will need to read: to collect and share and discuss books is one of the great joys of life. Matt Davis is the BookPeople 2024 Australian bookseller of the Year.

            "content": "He seems nice, at first. Then you learn what he\u2019s done. Grappling with the reality that every five days a woman in England and Wales is killed by a partner or an ex, Martha Loader\u2019s Bruntwood prize-winning play is a sobering watch. With suggestions of something deep-rooted and suffocating, Bindweed confronts the pervasiveness of violence against women and the task of curbing it. Denial and self-hatred share the Arcola\u2019s stage as four men who have committed domestic abuse attend group therapy led by an ex-cop, Jen (Laura Hanna). Jennifer Tang\u2019s direction holds the multi-roleplaying cast taut throughout, their fists clenched and shoulders heavy. Every week these men gather, arguing and peeling back layers of themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s like working with children,\u201d Jen tells a friend. \u201cReally big, dangerous children.\u201d Designer Lulu Tam frames the performers with white chairs hanging above the stage, a jumble of the domestic and institutional. Some of the men\u2019s violence ripples at the surface. In others, it\u2019s pushed down deeper. Moray Treadwell is eerily calm as a repeat offender and former vicar who still wears his clerical collar every day, and Sean Kingsley is devastating as charming, brutal Brian who chuckles his way through explaining smashing his wife\u2019s head in. Shailan Gohil tips into caricature as Jen\u2019s leery date Peter \u2013 a plotline that is scary yet predictable \u2013 but he holds the stage as offender Charlie, terrified of being unable to break the cycles of aggression he\u2019s grown up with. Loader\u2019s assured script finds the men\u2019s humanity in ways that complicate and deepen but never absolve them. The more we learn about the group, the harder it seems to cleanse their bone-deep brutality, even when they detest it in themselves. A smart subplot where Jen\u2019s friends (a richly versatile Simon Darwen and Josie Brightwell) laugh off their son\u2019s bad behaviour illuminates how these tendrils of violence and misogyny can spread early and young. The high tension can be almost wearying, with the sessions\u2019 circling arguments risking falling into a monotony of violence. But the final scenes grab tight, their revelations sharp and shocking. The action is rooted by Jen\u2019s exhaustion and fury, vividly showing what an impossible job she has, to try to be the one who fixes these men. To have to deal with the grief when she can\u2019t. \u2022 At the Arcola theatre, London, until 13 July In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women\u2019s Aid.

            "content": "After one of the worst Russian missile strikes against Ukraine in recent months, Nato leaders will sit down in Washington this week to announce the details of a hard-fought aid package that will include crucial air defense systems meant to protect Ukrainian cities. The package put forward by Nato countries has been presented as \u201chistoric\u201d and is an widely seen as an attempt to \u201cfutureproof\u201d continued aid to Ukraine \u2013 but it may not fully satisfy Kyiv, which has been facing unprecedented attacks against civilian sites and infrastructure. The resumption of large-scale missile strikes against targets in Kyiv will increase the sense of urgency around the discussions among 32 Nato leaders. Images from Kyiv showed children at a pediatric cancer hospital covered in blood and dust after the strike on Monday which a Biden administration official described as \u201chorrific, tragic, senseless\u201d. There were believed to be bodies still trapped under the rubble of the hospital. \u201cThis is a fully deliberate action, specifically designed and approved by \u2026 Putin. On the eve of the @Nato summit. As a slap in the face to the alliance,\u201d wrote Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidential administration. He called it an \u201cinformal signal\u201d that \u201ceven the outright murder of children will not make them [the Alliance] take all the necessary decisions. And that is why we continue to attack.\u201d Observers expect Nato members to pledge of at least four additional Patriot missile batteries to Ukraine at the conclusion of this week\u2019s summit. Zelenskiy had previously asked Nato for seven batteries, telling Nato members that Putin \u201cmust be brought down to earth, and our sky must become safe again ... And it depends fully on your choice \u2026 [the] choice whether we are indeed allies.\u201d It is expected that the four Patriot missile systems will likely be delivered by the US, Germany, Romania and a Dutch-led multinational effort. Spain, Greece and Poland also field Patriot missile systems but have so far not pledged to supply any batteries to Ukraine. Another system could be provided by Israel, which now employs the Iron Dome and other air defense systems to protect against rocket and missile attacks. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that allies need to step up and provide Ukraine with additional air defense systems, precisely in order to be able to prevent types of tragedies that we\u2019ve seen today, but sadly that we\u2019ve seen time and again, month after a month since the beginning of this brutal and senseless war,\u201d said Michael Carpenter, senior director for Europe at the US National Security Council. The new military aid package to Ukraine is expected to include a joint commitment from Nato members to spend at least \u20ac40bn ($43bn) in 2025 on aid to Ukraine. \u201cSince Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022, Allies have provided \u20ac40bn in military support to Ukraine each year,\u201d Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of Nato, said last month. \u201cWe must maintain this level of support as a minimum, and for as long as it takes.\u201d Stoltenberg had asked for a multi-year pledge from the 32 Nato member states but it did not appear that they had come to an agreement on the eve of the summit. A European official said that the idea of a multi-year pledge was \u201cstill being discussed because some allies including here are uncomfortable with the idea of a multi-annual pledge because of their legal and institutional limitations, so I think we still have to wait\u201d. One way around that issue, the official said, would be to \u201cjust make an annual pledge and then to recommit summit after summit\u201d. Next year\u2019s Nato summit is set to take place at the Hague. But that could take place after the re-election of Donald Trump, who has threatened to cut aid to Ukraine or make it conditional on starting talks with Russia. \u201cThe big orange elephant in the room for the Nato summit is that everything good that\u2019s going to be said about Ukraine comes with a big caveat,\u201d said Camille Grand, a former Nato assistant secretary general who is now at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIt is will this all hold if Trump is elected? And I don\u2019t believe in bureaucracies \u2026 because it has been agreed at the Nato summit that the Trump administration would follow that.\u201d Nato members are expected to announce the establishment of a new military command in the German city of Wiesbaden which would coordinate military aid and training for Ukraine, effectively replacing the US-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group. That would in effect move the onus of supplying Ukraine from the Pentagon to Nato, in what US officials have said would be a \u201cbridge to membership\u201d preparing the country to be ready to work with the alliance when it is admitted \u201con day one\u201d. The new effort is also seen as a way to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d future aid to Ukraine if he is elected in November by \u201cinstitutionalising\u201d aid to Kyiv. Carpenter also said that there would be announcements concerning the provision of F-16s to Ukraine. Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway have pledged to provide Ukraine with about 80 US made F-16 fighter jets between them, but the program to get the planes in the air has been hit by delays in delivery and training. The first F-16s are expected to arrive this summer. On the eve of the summit, diplomats said there was still \u201cno consensus\u201d on Nato issuing an invitation to Ukraine at the summit to join the alliance. \u201cSome allies are reluctant in that direction, but we are discussing languages to at least showcase that Ukraine\u2019s path to membership is irreversible, that there is no there is no way back,\u201d said a European official. A Biden administration official declined to directly discuss the language of the final communiqu\u00e9 because it was \u201cstill being negotiated\u201d, but said that the summit declaration \u201cwill include very strong signals of Allied support for Ukraine on its path to Euro-Atlantic integration. And it\u2019s going to also underscore the importance of Ukraine\u2019s vital work on democratic, economic and security reforms.\u201d"

            "content": "Pressure on Beijing to take steps to improve Chinese consumer confidence has intensified after news that weak retail spending dragged down the growth rate of the world\u2019s second biggest economy. With falling house prices still acting as a drag on activity, official figures showed the Chinese economy expanding at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter \u2013 much weaker than the 5.1% expected by the financial markets. Annual retail sales growth slowed from 3.2% to 2% in the three months ending in June \u2013 the weakest in 18 months \u2013 and fell slightly in June alone. Lynn Song, the chief China economist at ING bank, said retail sales growth was the lowest since the country emerged from Covid-19 lockdowns and showed the depressed state of consumer confidence remained a big headwind to the economic recovery. \u201cA negative wealth effect from falling property and stock prices, as well as low wage growth amid various industries\u2019 cost cutting is dragging consumption and causing a pivot from big-ticket purchases toward a basic \u2018eat, drink and play\u2019 theme,\u201d Song said. The government in Beijing has set a growth target for 2024 of 5% \u2013 something analysts consider to be a stretch in the absence of tax cuts, spending increases and measures to help the property market. On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded by 0.7% in the three months to June, compared with a downwardly revised 1.5% in the first quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said. To counter soft domestic demand and its property crisis, China has increased infrastructure investment and ploughed funds into hi-tech manufacturing. Strong export growth has partly compensated for the reluctance of consumers to spend. Figures released last week showed China\u2019s exports in June were up 8.6% from a year earlier, while imports shrank by 2.3%. Duncan Wrigley, the chief China+ economist at Pantheon Macro, said: \u201cThe property market is showing tentative signs of bottoming out. New home prices sank 0.67% month on month in June, a trivial improvement from the 0.71% drop in May. Preowned home prices dropped 0.85%, after the 1.00% dive in May. Residential sales value fell 12.2% year on year in June, partly thanks to base effects, after crashing 26.4% in May.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-01T16:26:54Z",
            "content": "Companies in countries worldwide may be toying with the idea of implementing shorter working weeks, but in Greece employees have been told that, henceforth, they can put in a sixth day of labour in an unorthodox step aimed at turbocharging productivity. After outpacing other Europeans in terms of economic growth, the nation once at the heart of the continent\u2019s worst financial crisis has bucked the trend again, introducing a 48-hour working week. The measure, decried as \u201cbarbaric\u201d by unions, takes effect from Monday. \u201cIt makes no sense whatsoever,\u201d said Akis Sotiropoulos an executive committee member of the civil servants\u2019 union Adedy. \u201cWhen almost every other civilised country is enacting a four-day week, Greece decides to go the other way.\u201d The pro-business government of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, says the initiative was made necessary by the twin perils of a shrinking population and shortage of skilled workers. Prior to announcing the legislation \u2013 part of a broader set of labour laws passed last year \u2013 Mitsotakis described the projected demographic shift as a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d. In an unprecedented exodus, about 500,000 mostly young educated Greeks are estimated to have emigrated since the near decade-long debt crisis erupted in late 2009. The six-day scheme, officials say, will only apply to private businesses providing round-the-clock services. Under the extended working week, staff in select industries and manufacturing facilities will have the option of working an additional two hours a day or an extra eight-hour shift, rewarded with a top-up fee of 40% added to the daily wage. Either choice, the centre right government claims, will redress the issue of employees not being paid for overtime while also tackling the pervasive problem of undeclared work. \u201cThe nucleus of this legislation is worker-friendly, it is deeply growth-oriented,\u201d Mitsotakis said before the Greek parliament endorsed the law. \u201cAnd it brings Greece in line with the rest of Europe.\u201d But the backlash has been fierce. In a country with almost no tradition of inspections in the workplace, critics contend the reform ultimately sounds the death knell of the five-day working week, not least because it enables employers to dictate whether a sixth day of labour is required. For opponents, who have already taken to the streets in protest, the reform erodes legal protections and rolls back long-established workers\u2019 rights in the name of flexibility. \u201cIn reality this has been passed by a government ideologically committed to generating ever bigger profits for capital,\u201d said Sotiropoulos. \u201cBetter productivity comes with better work conditions, a better quality of life [for employees] and that, we now know, is about less hours not more.\u201d The measure, he said, had been made possible partly because trade unions had also seen their power wane as a result of debt-stricken Athens enacting austerity measures in return for rescue funds during the country\u2019s financial crisis. Unions have long argued that overtime enables employers to hold back on hiring more staff. Trialled four-day week programmes have repeatedly shown increased levels of productivity with researchers attributing the outcome to improved levels of focus. Belgium in 2022 legislated to give employees the legal right to spread their working week over four days instead of five, and pilot schemes have been carried out in countries including the UK, Germany, Japan, South Africa and Canada. Greeks already work the longest hours in Europe, putting in an average 41 hours a week according to the EU\u2019s statistics agency, Eurostat, although surveys have also proved they get paid much less. The left-wing opposition has frequently decried \u201cBulgarian salaries in a country of British prices\u201d, claiming the phenomenon has only exacerbated the brain drain. People on pensions, who have also been encouraged to work under the legislation, have weighed into the debate. \u201cWhat the government is essentially saying is \u2018go and work longer, we\u2019ll turn a blind eye even if you\u2019re a pensioner,\u2019\u201d said Grigoris Kalomoiris who heads the union of retired teachers (Pesek). \u201cIt knows that the majority of Greeks, on an average monthly salary of \u20ac900, can only survive until the 20th of the month. This latest barbaric measure is not going to solve the fundamental problem of labour shortages and a lot of us feel it is very unfair to unemployed young Greeks who may never have a job.\u201d"

            "content": "Stock markets in Europe and Asia took a tumble on Thursday as jitters over the future artificial intelligence-driven growth of major tech companies sparked a global sell-off. The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed the day down 0.7%, having been hit by a near 4% decline in the Dutch chipmaker ASML, a 7% drop in Germany\u2019s Infineon Technologies, and a 13.7% fall in Switzerland\u2019s semiconductor company STMicroelectronics. The rout began in the US overnight, where the tech-focused Nasdaq fell 3.6% on Wednesday, marking its biggest single-day decline since 2022. About $1tn (\u00a3776bn) was knocked off the value of the Nasdaq 100, which covers the most valuable firms on the index. The main losers were AI-related companies, including Nvidia, Tesla and the Google-owner Alphabet, whose shares have soared in recent months. Investors have poured money into the sector, to ensure they did not miss out on a potential tech boom in artificial intelligence. The fall has raised concerns about whether excitement over major tech stocks, known as the magnificent seven, has been overblown. Nvidia fell 7%, Alphabet fell 5%, Microsoft dropped 3.5% and Apple lost 3%. Other magnificent seven stocks also fell, including Facebook owner Meta, which dropped 5.6%. Tesla had its worst decline since 2020, dropping 12%. The company\u2019s boss, Elon Musk, had reported a 45% fall in profits and pushed back plans to unveil self-driving robotaxis from August to October, igniting scepticism among investors. Musk has been trying to drum up interest in plans for the robot taxis, artificial intelligence and \u201cgenuinely useful\u201d humanoid robots, as demand for Tesla\u2019s electric cars has cooled. The stock market losses later spread to Asia, where tech-related firms continued their decline. That included Samsung, which fell 2%, Sony, which fell 5%, and tech investor SoftBank, which fell 9.4%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei finished the session down 3%. However, the AJ Bell investment analyst Dan Coatsworth said the sell-off may be a \u201cnecessary correction\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is worth putting last night\u2019s weakness into perspective, given indices were recently trading at record highs and there were big moves in some enormous companies. \u201cWhether this is a necessary correction to remove some froth from the market or something more dramatic will depend on forthcoming earnings from the likes of Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Amazon next week, as well as AI-star Nvidia at the end of August.\u201d Early trading on Wall Street was more subdued on Thursday, with the Nasdaq, Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 indices slightly up, as GDP data showing that the US economy grew faster than expected in the three months to the end of June."

            "date": "2024-07-18T12:55:17Z",
            "content": "UK wage growth slowed in May to the lowest level in two years amid a cooling jobs market, underscoring the challenge for the Bank of England as policymakers decide whether to cut interest rates. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show annual pay growth eased from 5.9% in the three months to April to 5.7% in the three months to May, matching City economists\u2019 predictions. Unemployment was unchanged from 4.4% in April, while the number of job vacancies fell by 30,000 led by dwindling demand in retail and hospitality amid a continued slowdown in hiring across the economy. After a sharp fall in headline inflation over recent months, real wage growth taking into account the rising cost of living has strengthened. Total real pay, including bonuses, rose by 3% on the year in the three months to May. Growth was last higher in the three months to August 2021, when it was 4.5%. Liz McKeown, the ONS director of economic statistics, said: \u201cWe continue to see overall some signs of a cooling in the labour market, with the growth in the number of employees on the payroll weakening over the medium term and unemployment gradually increasing. \u201cEarnings growth in cash terms, while remaining relatively strong, is showing signs of slowing again. However, with inflation falling, in real terms it is at its highest rate in over two and a half years.\u201d In a sign of the cooling labour market, the latest snapshot showed there were now more than 500,000 more people out of work than this time last year, driven by a rise in economic inactivity \u2013 when working-age adults are neither in a job nor looking for one. Although economic inactivity has come down in recent months, it remains close to a record high at almost 9.4 million, with almost a third outside the workforce due to near record levels of long-term sickness. Liz Kendall, the new work and pensions secretary, said the UK was standing alone as the only G7 country where the employment rate was not back to pre-pandemic levels. \u201cThis is a truly dire inheritance which the government is determined to tackle,\u201d she said. \u201cBehind these statistics are real people, who have for too long been ignored and denied the support they need to get into work and get on at work. It\u2019s time for change.\u201d Financial markets expect Bank policymakers will hold off from cutting interest rates from the current level of 5.25% at their meeting on 1 August, instead waiting until they are convinced that inflation will remain close to the government\u2019s 2% target before reducing the cost of borrowing. Threadneedle Street has previously warned that inflation is likely to rise above 2% this year amid resilient wage growth and price increases in the service sector of the economy. The figures come after headline inflation unexpectedly remained at 2% in June for a second month in a row, while underlying measures from the service sector also held steady in a development likely to dash hopes for an August rate cut. Although wage growth is cooling, economists said at 5.7% it remained inconsistent with the Bank\u2019s 2% inflation target. Ashley Webb, a UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the slowdown in the jobs market probably was not enough to offset strength in services inflation. \u201cAs a result, we have changed our forecast for the timing of the first interest rate cut from 5.25% from August to September, although it is a close call,\u201d he said. Several members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, including its chief economist, Huw Pill, have warned in the past week that service sector inflation and a tight jobs market could force Threadneedle Street to take a cautious approach. Last month the European Central Bank became the first major global central bank to cut official borrowing costs. On Thursday it left interest rates unchanged. The US Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, this week hinted that it would not necessarily wait for US inflation to drop to its 2% target before cutting interest rates, bolstering expectations for a cut in September."

Gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of economic health \u2013 rose 2.8% in three months to June, the commerce department reported on Thursday, ahead of economists\u2019 expectations and up sharply from 1.4% in the first quarter. It comes as the presidential election campaign heightens scrutiny of the US economy. While Joe Biden touted the \u201cstrongest economy in the world\u201d as he announced his withdrawal from the race on Sunday, Donald Trump \u2013 who is running to replace him in the White House \u2013 has accused Biden of weakening the economy.

Despite relatively rosy economic figures, nearly three in five Americans wrongly believe the US is in recession, and the majority blame the Biden administration, according to a Harris poll conducted for the Guardian in May. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve scrambled to bring down inflation from its highest level in a generation, raising interest rates to a two-decade high. They are now considering when to start cutting rates, amid early signs that price growth is falling back towards the Fed\u2019s 2% target. \u201cThis is a perfect report for the Fed,\u201d Olu Sonola, head of economic research at Fitch Ratings, said of Thursday\u2019s GDP numbers. \u201cGrowth during the first half of the year is not too hot, inflation continues to cool and the elusive soft landing scenario looks within reach.\u201d Economists had expected GDP growth of about 2% in the second quarter.

Our one constant exception was sweet peas, which were kickstarted for us in Fern Verrow farmer Jane Scotter\u2019s Hereford greenhouse and later delivered on the fruit and vegetable run. Finally, this year we\u2019ve grown up and grown our own. I sourced assorted seed from Roger Parsons, home of the national collection. Blooms were chosen for strong colour and scent, from the \u201cold-fashioned\u201d and Spencer selections. We started them in the bedroom, then moved outside as soon as it was warm and bright enough. Later, they were transplanted to the plot when Howard sourced new hazel poles. And here we are at last. Grown-up proper gardeners \u2013 two tents of sweet peas, with a handful of scented glory to add to this week\u2019s calendula, radishes and salad leaves to take home. Everything else is still sown in situ: climbing beans and peas at the base of poles. Our leaves and flowers are grown in patches rather than rows and I think for now we will stick with this as the plot predators seem more likely to leave them alone. There are small beds of cosmos and tagetes. Others may be a mix from dill, orache, fennel, calendula and sunflowers. The latter to be scattered and shared when perhaps a foot tall. I think I\u2019ll always be excited when I see shoots break through. Gardening as caring: almost a form of parenting perhaps. But now, what are your forever plants, some favourite thing to grow?

            "date": "2024-07-16T15:48:18Z",
            "content": "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched a full investigation into Microsoft\u2019s deal with AI startup Inflection. Earlier this year, Mustafa Suleyman \u2013 who started Inflection in January 2022, two months after leaving Google \u2013 and a number of his colleagues were hired by Microsoft to lead the tech company\u2019s new AI division. At the same time, Microsoft signed deals with Inflection to access its AI models. The arrangement was criticised by regulators at the time as it avoided the regulatory attention of an outright acquisition. In April, the UK regulator said it was \u201cconsidering whether it is or may be the case that the transaction has resulted in the creation of a relevant merger\u201d, and opened a three-month comment period. It now has enough evidence to begin a full investigation, it said, with a decision on whether to progress to the next stage due by 11 September. A Microsoft spokesperson said: \u201cWe are confident that the hiring of talent promotes competition and should not be treated as a merger. We will provide the UK Competition and Markets Authority with the information it needs to complete its inquiries expeditiously.\u201d An Inflection spokesperson said: \u201cInflection AI is moving rapidly to implement our new enterprise product and strategy while continuing to support our core technology platform. While we don\u2019t want ongoing regulatory inquiries to become a distraction to our commercial focus, we are happy to cooperate with the authorities in their investigation of Microsoft.\u201d At the time of the Microsoft and Inflection AI tie-up, the EU antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, said: \u201cWe have registered that this is happening and also registering that it\u2019s happening in a way so that it escapes our scrutiny from our usual boxes.\u201d The CMA\u2019s move comes amid broader concerns about competition in the AI sector. Another deal involving Microsoft and French AI startup Mistral was investigated by the CMA at the same time as the Inflection inquiry, though the regulator later dropped its investigation. A deal between Amazon and AI lab Anthropic is also being investigated by the CMA as a potential merger. Anthropic has committed to using Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider, while Amazon has taken a $4bn (\u00a33.1bn) stake in the company, which develops the Claude LLM (large language model). Meanwhile, ChatGPT maker OpenAI took a substantial investment from Microsoft in 2019. This was paid in part in credits for its cloud computing service. Last week, Microsoft dropped its \u201cobserver\u201d seat on the board of OpenAI. Instead, Microsoft and Apple, which had been about to take up a similar role, will attend \u201cregular stakeholder meetings\u201d, an OpenAI spokesperson said. The CMA is also investigating the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI, after the former took a substantial stake in the latter\u2019s for-profit arm. OpenAI once described the stake as making Microsoft the \u201cminority owner\u201d but this was quietly updated to note the company simply had a \u201cminority economic interest\u201d."

            "date": "2024-07-10T11:24:41Z",
            "content": "A British startup which uses technology to prevent renters from living in cold, damp homes has raised fresh funds to expand as landlords belatedly try to tackle outbreaks of mould in crumbling social housing. Switchee has secured \u00a35m, split equally between an existing investor, Axa IM Alts, and Octopus Ventures, part of the group which includes household gas and electricity supplier Octopus Energy. The company hopes to use the funds \u2013 which come on top of a \u00a36.5m investment round led by Axa in May 2023 \u2013 to help hit a long-term goal of installing its technology in 1m UK social housing properties. Switchee\u2019s technology, which is used by more than 130 social housing providers, measures humidity, temperature and pressure and analyses data with the aim of preventing mould and lowering heating bills, as well as improving communications between tenants and landlords. The quality of social housing has been in the spotlight since the death of Awaab Ishak, a two-year-old who died in 2020 after exposure to mould in the rented flat where he lived in Rochdale. Tom Robins, the chief executive of Switchee, said the toddler\u2019s death was an \u201cabsolute tragedy\u201d. \u201cThere is a continual trend here of setting a much higher bar of expectation in housing standards, and we\u2019re seeing landlords embracing that and looking for technology solutions that they can deliver a more efficient, effective service,\u201d he said. Robins said the investment represented a \u201creal milestone\u201d moment. \u201cWe see there is a moment as social housing in the UK moves from a reactive to a proactive model. There\u2019s clearly the demand and challenges, so we wanted to make the most of that.\u201d The company hopes to right an \u201cinjustice\u201d that \u201cpeople that can afford to pay their heating bills had access to technology to reduce the cost \u2026 where people who couldn\u2019t afford to pay their bills did not have access to that technology\u201d. Robins said, in one of the worst situations he had witnessed, a Switchee device had helped identify a damp home where a single mother and her daughter were living in the lounge and kitchen because the bedroom ceiling had collapsed. \u201cThey had been evicted for complaints in the past so they were terrified to tell their new landlord. The property was then gutted and redone completely,\u201d he said. The tech can also help to reduce the impact of home heating on the environment, and Switchee\u2019s devices have been deployed through government-funded initiatives such as the Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund. Robins said that revenues had been doubling for the last three years, reaching \u00a310m in its last financial year. \u201cWe are for-profit but our focus is on scale rather than profit,\u201d he said. Edward Keelan, a partner at Octopus Ventures, said it had been attracted by the company\u2019s B Corp status and focus on social housing and the environment. Axa is the company\u2019s largest single shareholder. Switchee was founded by Adam Fudakowski and Ian Napier in 2015 and has so far connected 35,000 devices in homes. Robins said he hoped to hit the target of reaching one million homes \u201cin the next five to 10 years\u201d. Robins paid tribute to Napier, who took his own life in 2019. \u201cHis belief in this drive for change is a very important part of the DNA of the business. We wouldn\u2019t be here today without him,\u201d he said."

On Tuesday night the English-born and Northern Ireland-raised athlete \u2013 who swims for Team Ireland \u2013 powered his way to gold medal success and an Olympic record in the 800m freestyle final. His success came just 24 hours after another Irish swimmer, Mona McSharry, won bronze in the 100m breaststroke final. The Irish president, Michael D Higgins, described Wiffen\u2019s performance as \u201ca wonderful achievement\u201d while the taoiseach, (Irish prime minister) Simon Harris, said on X that the entire country \u201cis hoarse from screaming at their televisions and computer screens\u201d. Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister, Michelle O\u2019Neill, and deputy first minister, Emma Little-Pengelly, described Wiffen\u2019s gold medal performance as \u201ca truly momentous occasion\u201d. \u201cNot only has he secured NI\u2019s first Olympic gold medal in 36 years, it is also the first of the Games for our athletes, and he set a new Olympic record,\u201d they added. It has also been a good week for the school Wiffen attended. Saint Patrick\u2019s grammarschool in Armagh city provided seven of the county\u2019s squad that won the GAA all-Ireland football final against Galway on Sunday. The school principal, Dominic Clarke, told RT\u00c9 radio that everyone at the school was still \u201con the crest of a wave\u201d after Wiffen\u2019s win. \u201cIt\u2019s just an absolutely fantastic achievement and it\u2019s just reward for the effort he\u2019s put in since he was a kid,\u201d he added. Many people in Ireland were struck by the confidence of the swimmer before the final. In interviews afterwards he said: \u201cMy birthday is on Bastille Day and it\u2019s 100 years since Ireland first competed at the Olympics. There was meant to be a storm at nine o\u2019clock, and I\u2019ll tell you what, it was the 100 metre freestyle.\u201d Watched on by his family including his twin brother, Nathan, who is also a swimmer, Wiffen came from behind, took the lead, and fell behind again before storming past his rivals to victory. Back home, radio and television stations had live broadcasts from swimming clubs and places associated with Ireland\u2019s first male gold medal winner in the sport. Wiffen follows in the footsteps of Michelle Smith de Bruin who won three golds at the 1996 Atlanta games, but a shadow was cast over her achievements after she was banned for four years for manipulating an anti-doping sample by deliberate contamination with alcohol. And he may not be finished yet, with at least one more event to come. \u201cWe\u2019re not done here. I can\u2019t wait for the 1500m freestyle. It\u2019s my favourite event,\u201d he said."

            "content": "Butter made from air instead of cows? A California-based startup claims to have worked out a complex process that eliminates the need for the animals while making its dairy-free alternative taste just as good. Savor, backed by the Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, has been experimenting with creating dairy-free alternatives to ice-cream, cheese, and milk by utilising a thermochemical process that allows it to build fat molecules, creating chains of carbon dioxide, hydrogen and oxygen. The company has now announced a new animal-free butter alternative. Reducing meat and dairy consumption is one of the key ways that humanity can reduce its environmental impact, as livestock production is a significant source of greenhouse gases, and Savor says its products will have a significantly lower carbon footprint than animal-based ones. The \u201cbutter\u201d could potentially come in at less than 0.8g CO2 equivalent per calorie. The standard climate footprint of real unsalted butter with 80% fat is approximately 2.4g CO2 equivalent per calorie. Kathleen Alexander, Savor\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe are currently pre-commercial and working through regulatory approval to be able to sell our butter. We are not expecting to be able to move forward with any kind of sales until at least 2025.\u201d Meat and dairy alternatives have become more and more popular in recent years, but some fall short in terms of flavour. Savor says the flavour of its butter is more exact. \u201cSo far, we had informal taste panels with tens of people,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cWe expect to perform a more formal panel as part of our commercialisation and scale-up efforts.\u201d The question now is whether buyers will take to such synthetic fats. Getting people to give up their favourite dairy and meat items for more \u201cexperimental\u201d foods may pose a challenge. Advocating for the initiative in an online blogpost, Gates wrote: \u201cThe idea of switching to lab-made fats and oils may seem strange at first. But their potential to significantly reduce our carbon footprint is immense. By harnessing proven technologies and processes, we get one step closer to achieving our climate goals. \u201cThe process doesn\u2019t release any greenhouse gases, and it uses no farmland and less than a thousandth of the water that traditional agriculture does. And most important, it tastes really good \u2013 like the real thing, because chemically it is.\u201d According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the livestock industry, which encompasses all dairy and meat agricultural farming, accounts for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. \u2022 This article was amended on 16 July 2024 to provide an approximate per-calorie, rather than per-kg, figure for the standard climate footprint (CO2 equivalent) of real unsalted butter with 80% fat."

Trump has repeatedly claimed he would end the war quickly, without offering details on how. Zelenskiy said on X that in their conversation he had congratulated Trump on securing the presidential nomination, condemned the assassination attempt on him and agreed to arrange a meeting in person to discuss \u201cwhat steps can make peace fair and truly lasting\u201d. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Ukraine was on its way to being able to \u201cstand on its own feet\u201d militarily and more than 20 other countries had pledged to maintain their own military and financial aid to the country even if the US were to withdraw its support under a different president. Blinken was for the first time directly addressing the possibility that Trump could win the November election and back away from commitments to Ukraine. A Russian missile hit a children\u2019s playground in Ukraine\u2019s southern city of Mykolaiv on Friday, killing a child and two adults and injuring five others, officials said. The playground was \u201cnear an ordinary house\u201d, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, calling on the world to help stop Russian \u201cterror\u201d. He posted photos to Telegram showing what appeared to be at least two dead bodies \u2013 one lying under rubble by the entrance to a building, and another in a courtyard \u2013 and part of a missile. Windows on a multi-storey residential building had been blown out. The regional governor hailed residents of the city who rushed to the site to help before medics arrived. Vitaliy Kim said on Telegram that another missile had landed elsewhere in the region. A nationalist former member of Ukraine\u2019s parliament known for her vociferous campaigns to defend the Ukrainian language has died after being shot in Lviv. Police launched a wide search for the gunman alleged to have shot Iryna Farion, 60, on a street in the western city. The regional governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, said on Telegram that Farion died after being taken to hospital. The interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, earlier said the shooting was being treated as an attempted assassination. Russian forces have captured the village of Yurivka in eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region, the Russian defence ministry said on Friday. A German national has been sentenced to death in Belarus, the German foreign ministry has said, hours after a Belarusian human rights group said a German combat medic had been sentenced to death by firing squad. The German ministry did not name its national but the Viasna Human Rights Centre said earlier on Friday that Rico Krieger, 30, had been convicted under six articles of Belarus\u2019s criminal code in a trial held at the end of June. The exact allegations against Krieger were not immediately clear. Viasna said the case might be linked to the Kastu\u015b Kalino\u016dski Regiment, a group of Belarusian volunteer fighters fighting against Russia in Ukraine. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer welcomed Volodymyr Zelenskiy at Downing Street on Friday, calling the visit a \u201creal piece of history\u201d. The Ukrainian president was greeted by the UK cabinet with a standing ovation as he became the first foreign leader to address the cabinet in person since 1997. Starmer said the UK would \u201cdouble down\u201d on backing for Ukraine, and confirmed he had accepted an invitation to visit Ukraine again in the future.

            "content": "In his first major speech as UK prime minister, at the start of 2023, a hopeful Rishi Sunak announced \u201cfive promises\u201d to show that his government would \u201calways reflect the people\u2019s priorities\u201d. Alongside familiar pledges to reduce inflation and grow the economy, there was a bold new promise: to \u201cstop the boats\u201d. \u201cWe will pass new laws to stop small boats, making sure that if you come to this country illegally, you are detained and swiftly removed,\u201d Sunak announced. \u201cNo tricks, no ambiguity, we\u2019re either delivering for you or we\u2019re not,\u201d he told reporters \u2013 in an upbeat mood and a crisp white shirt, a long way from the rain-sodden and crestfallen prime minister we saw announcing the election last month. Colleagues were startled by his decision to stake so much of his reputation on a pledge that was clearly unachievable. \u201cIt was obviously stupid to say you\u2019re going to stop the boats, when you\u2019re very unlikely to be able to,\u201d a long-term Home Office staffer told me, recalling his surprise at the announcement. \u201cCall me cynical, but I assumed it was just a slogan to put clear blue water between him and the Labour party. I\u2019m not sure he ever believed he could actually do it.\u201d But Sunak doubled down. By March 2023, he was standing behind a new branded lectern decorated with a \u201cstop the boats\u201d logo. In May 2023, he said: \u201cI\u2019m relentlessly focused on stopping the boats. That\u2019s one of my five priorities, and we\u2019re doing absolutely everything we can to do that.\u201d In August, he filmed a slick \u201cstop the boats\u201d video message, against a soundtrack of gently beating drums and the splintering noises of immigration officers breaking down someone\u2019s front door with a battering ram. Eighteen months on, tricks and ambiguity are all that remains of Sunak\u2019s bold pledge. The number of crossings dipped slightly in 2023, but by 24 June the total arrivals by small boats this year stood at 12,901, higher than the total for the same period in any of the previous four years. Images of crowded, dangerous vessels making their way to the UK remain regular features on news bulletins, highlighting (depending on your perspective) that desperate people are prepared to risk their lives to travel to the UK or that the post-Brexit Conservative government has failed to take back control of its borders. It has long been a trick of immigration politics for governments to signal their \u201ctoughness\u201d with punitive commitments to crack down on illegal migration, in order to distract from parallel policies that have increased legal immigration numbers to meet the requirements of a growing economy. Under New Labour, tough talk about \u201cfalse asylum seekers\u201d was often an attempted smokescreen for rising figures of legal migration. But no government has fumbled the issue so dramatically as Sunak\u2019s. As a result, the small boats debacle has become emblematic of this latest troubled chapter of Conservative rule. Public dissatisfaction with the government\u2019s handling of immigration is at a record high, according to the thinktank British Future, which has been running surveys on this question since 2015. Among the 69% of people who say they are dissatisfied, Sunak\u2019s failure to \u201cstop the boats\u201d is the most cited reason for their disapproval. Anyone who has looked at the Conservative record on immigration since 2010 will not be surprised by this breathtaking gulf between rhetoric and reality. The story of Conservative immigration policy is a tale of ambitious targets and harsh anti-immigration policies that have not resulted in reducing immigration \u2013 illegal or legal. Instead, immigration into the UK has climbed to record levels. Most of this has been the result of legal migration, which in 2022 soared to an all-time peak, with net migration at 745,000, up from 184,000 in 2019. But because of the relentless political and media focus on stopping the small boats, polling shows most voters (once you strip out the \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d) think illegal migration is larger than legal migration. In fact, the numbers are not even comparable: an estimated 96% of immigrants are invited in, arriving legally to study, to take up jobs as skilled workers, or in the health and care sectors. Some within the government have privately welcomed the post-Brexit increase in immigration, which has brought in foreign students to prop up an underfunded university system and much-needed workers to fill vacancies, primarily in the care sector. Others are proud that between 2021 and 2023, about half a million people have been given status in the UK under new, nationality-specific humanitarian routes: about 283,000 from Ukraine and 191,000 from Hong Kong. But with Nigel Farage declaring that this is the immigration election, Conservative ministers have preferred to avoid public discussions of how reliant Britain\u2019s economy has become on rising net migration. * * * Since 2010, Conservative ministers have consistently promised to cut immigration and immigration has consistently soared. The political sleight of hand whereby ministers focus noisily on harsh policies designed to curb illegal immigration, while authorised migration quietly increases, was first attempted by Theresa May with her \u201chostile environment\u201d policies, which led catastrophically to the Windrush scandal. Under Sunak, the same distraction technique has been attempted with his relentless focus on stopping small boats, with similarly poor results \u2013 the small boats were not stopped, and the immigration commitments were not met. Who should bear responsibility for the repeated failure to fulfil immigration pledges? Since 2010, Britain has had five Conservative prime ministers, all promising to reduce immigration, and seven Conservative home secretaries, one of whom served only six days. (The total could actually be considered to be eight if you count Suella Braverman\u2019s second period in the role separately.) There have been at least 11 immigration ministers and an innumerable cast of young and influential ideologues serving as special advisers. Most concerningly, there have been six Home Office permanent secretaries. The civil servant leaders are called \u201cpermanent\u201d secretaries to emphasise that they offer continuity in the face of the endless merry-go-round of political reshuffles, resignations and sackings. In the Home Office, there has been no continuity. Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King\u2019s College London, says David Cameron should take a large chunk of responsibility for setting the administration on the wrong course with his 2010 pledge to cut immigration to the tens of thousands, from the then record level of 252,000. Cameron told voters: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s unrealistic; that\u2019s the sort of figure there was in the 1990s and I think we should see that again.\u201d A year after winning office, he repeated the pledge: \u201cOur borders will be under control and immigration will be at levels our country can manage. No ifs, no buts. That\u2019s a promise we made to the British people and it\u2019s a promise we are keeping.\u201d Cameron\u2019s repetition of the net migration reduction target crystallised a growing belief that high numbers of people arriving in the UK were obviously a bad thing. Oliver Letwin, who was then minister of state for government policy in the Cabinet Office, later acknowledged that this rhetoric proved hugely problematic. \u201cWe completely failed to explain the countervailing benefits of migration, so the whole argument was won by default by those who argued that migration was a bad thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe completely lost the argument that it was sustaining our economy and much of our public services.\u201d Net migration had increased to 379,000 by the 2015 election, and the ambition to cut annual net migration to the tens of thousands was restated in the next Conservative manifesto: \u201cThat ambition remains the right one.\u201d Theresa May also made the same commitment, while Boris Johnson said he wanted to see overall numbers fall from about 245,000. None of these promises were met and, like the \u201cstop the boats\u201d commitment, they became embarrassing failures, regularly flagged up with the publication of quarterly migration statistics. Portes was chief economist in the Cabinet Office in 2010 when Cameron became prime minister, and advised him to step back from the tens-of-thousands commitment, urging him to embrace the economic advantages of immigration. \u201cOne of the first things I did was to write a note to Cameron saying: \u2018The problem with this is that unless we stay in a severe recession for five years, the choice you\u2019re going to have is between either breaking your promise or doing things which are economically negative.\u2019 The response was: \u2018Don\u2019t worry.\u2019\u201d Because EU free movement meant there was no lever to reduce the biggest inflow of immigration, much of the rhetoric shifted from curbing legal migration (which ministers couldn\u2019t control), to introducing a series of hostile environment measures so the government could make a show of tackling illegal immigration. Actually being robust on immigration numbers was impossible and enforcement by deportation expensive, so the Home Office was instead under instructions to do everything it could to be seen to be tough. It rebranded its vehicles as \u201cimmigration enforcement\u201d, trialled driving vans with the message \u201cgo home or face arrest\u201d around areas of high migration and began sending out pointedly hostile tweets, such as its 2013 Valentine\u2019s Day offering: \u201c#Rosesareredvioletsareblue, if your marriage is a sham we\u2019ll be on to you #happyvalentinesday.\u201d The message of fierce enforcement seeped through the department, from ministers at the top, to the most junior officials. For years, no one blew the whistle as what would become known as the Windrush scandal brewed unnoticed, with thousands of legal long-term UK residents complaining they were being misclassified as illegal immigrants. Portes says: \u201cCameron backed himself into saying migration is bad, we want less of it, and found himself boxed in by EU free movement and rising EU immigration, and pushed into the Brexit referendum, without a defensible position. He was saying we need to stay in the EU, and at the same time saying we need to reduce migration, while it was clear you could not, in the short term, control migration properly while you were still in the EU.\u201d Madeleine Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory, which provides analysis of migration in the UK, says the past 14 years have seen \u201ca boom and bust cycle \u2013 a lot of policy change. We had a crackdown, then we had liberalisation, then another crackdown.\u201d With cool understatement, she adds: \u201cWhen the rules change, it creates unpredictability; that\u2019s not necessarily optimal.\u201d The immigration lawyer Colin Yeo notes that in the past 14 years there have been repeated policy initiatives that make life harder for migrants without succeeding in the repeatedly stated goal of reducing net migration. \u201cBeing tough on migrants is not the same as being tough on immigration. It has minimal effect on numbers but a significant adverse effect on integration,\u201d he says. The Conservatives\u2019 record on immigration has been a failure on its own terms \u2013 with its spectacular and chronic missing of targets. More significantly, the party\u2019s rhetoric has shifted the immigration narrative decisively towards a much wider demonisation of people who have travelled to the UK in search of work and better lives. * * * Few people blame the Conservatives for the emergence of the small boats phenomenon, which came about when people-smuggling gangs realised in about 2018 that it was actually much less difficult than previously believed to transport people 20 miles across the Channel in inflatable dinghies. Since 2018, almost 120,000 people have come to the UK this way, although many of these might previously have travelled by different unauthorised routes \u2013 in lorries, cars, trains, shipping containers; options that have become less favoured because of increased border checks, intensified security in Calais, and the construction of fences and walls around the port, funded by British taxpayers. There has been huge frustration within the Home Office at politicians\u2019 responses to the crisis, as successive ministers\u2019 have searched for flashy \u201csilver bullet\u201d solutions to the rising number of crossings. Since Sajid Javid, when he was home secretary, was forced to fly back from his family Christmas holiday in 2018 after 82 people crossed the Channel in the space of a few days (a relatively small number compared with what followed later), the Home Office has contemplated, in defiance of legal advice, bringing in the navy and the military to push boats back to Calais and has discussed wave machines and a sea fence. (These last two ideas were swiftly dismissed.) More money was sent to France to fund extra police patrols, drones and infrared night goggles. In the UK, jet skis were bought and training sessions for staff were held in Portsmouth harbour. \u201cThe plan was that they would be used like sheepdogs, rounding up the boats, herding them together and turning them around,\u201d a source close to the Home Office said. Lawyers repeatedly told the Home Office the tactic was unsafe and illegal, and the jet skis were abandoned. Backlogs within the Home Office\u2019s asylum-processing department were allowed to build up. \u201cThey thought that if people were promptly rescued, promptly processed, promptly put into accommodation and promptly had their asylum claim reviewed, that that would encourage further arrivals \u2013 so there was a benign neglect of the system,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey wanted people to feel that they would be generally mucked about and left stranded when they got here \u2013 as a deterrent.\u201d However, as Yeo notes: \u201cIt is inherently unlikely that desperate people with literally nothing to lose, who are willing to repeatedly risk their lives, can be deterred.\u201d Officials suggested a quieter and more pragmatic approach including swifter processing of asylum claims, in order to move people out of hotels faster. (Last year, the government was paying \u00a38m a day on housing asylum seekers in hotels, but says the figure has since been reduced.) They also suggested that the arrivals should be seen in a context of increased global migration and that voters should be told the numbers of small boats were not particularly high when compared with refugee arrivals across Europe. \u201cThis is not just the Brits being useless; Biden and Trump have faced similar problems. This is a really tricky global problem that no one\u2019s found the answer to,\u201d the source said. \u201cBut they set themselves up to fail with that promise.\u201d Sunak hoped his Rwanda plan would be operational before the election campaign, and that boat numbers would drop once people saw that deportations of asylum seekers were happening. Instead, as the election approaches, those who came to the UK after 7 March 2023 \u2013 the date from which Sunak\u2019s Illegal Migration Act barred all boat arrivals from being granted residence \u2013 remain in a state of limbo. By the end of 2023, of the 77,000 individuals identified for removal under the new legislation, only 25 had been deported. Disagreements about Rwanda and small boats policy marked the fiercest part of the final leaders\u2019 debate last week. Keir Starmer highlighted that 50,000 people had arrived in small boats since Sunak became prime minister, and promised that Labour would increase international operations to prosecute people-smugglers \u2013 offering \u201csmash the gangs\u201d as an alternative to the \u201cstop the boats\u201d slogan. Sunak pledged to get his Rwanda scheme working in July and repeatedly demanded clarity from Starmer about what his approach would be towards people who arrived in the UK, asking: \u201cWhat would you do?\u201d Once again, the heat and fury over this relatively small element of policy occupied a disproportionate amount of airtime, and wider immigration issues were barely broached. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, says the Rwanda policy is the most extreme embodiment of the hostile environment policies that caused the Windrush scandal. \u201c[Sunak] was simply overpromising and was inevitably going to underdeliver in a catastrophic way,\u201d Solomon says. \u201cIt is playing politics in a way that will ultimately have a very detrimental impact on the lives of people who come here as refugees, seeking asylum and seeking safety.\u201d"

The first F-16 fighter jets are on their way to Ukraine and will be flying missions this summer, the Dutch and Danish governments have said. Dan Sabbagh writes that they will be the first of about 85 of the combat aircraft that have been committed to Kyiv to turn around its fortunes on the battlefield, and Ukraine signalled more may be to come. A Russian missile attack on the Odesa region killed two people and damaged port infrastructure on Wednesday, the region\u2019s governor said. Russia\u2019s security service, the FSB, claimed to have thwarted an attempt by Ukrainian intelligence services to induce a crew member on the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov in Murmansk to sabotage the ship. The Kremlin has criticised the new British prime minister, Keir Starmer, for his comments affirming that Ukraine can use British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles against legitimate targets within Russia. Keir Starmer is expected to promise that the UK will support Ukraine for \u201cas long as it takes\u201d as he confirms Britain\u2019s \u00a33bn a year funding package for Kyiv will continue for as long as needed.

            "date": "2024-07-31T08:23:01Z",
            "content": "Like all prominent Hamas figures, Ismail Haniyeh lived under the constant threat of assassination; his death in the Iranian capital of Tehran in a reported missile strike appears to be the latest daring Israeli operation targeting its enemies around the world. In the aftermath of the Palestinian militant group\u2019s brutal 7 October attack, Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Hamas\u2019s leadership, including those outside the Gaza Strip, were \u201cmarked for death\u201d. The timing and location of Haniyeh\u2019s killing, however, means it could be yet another destabilising factor in a conflict already on the verge of escalating into a regional war. Missteps in this choreography of airstrikes and targeted killings are an ever-present possibility, and the stakes keep getting higher. Assassinating the head of Hamas\u2019s political bureau is ostensibly a major morale boost for Israel, a boon for the unpopular Netanyahu, and a heavy blow to the Palestinian group. After almost 10 months of fighting in Gaza, Israel had until now failed to take out Hamas\u2019s top leaders: the mastermind of 7 October, Yahya Sinwar, is still at large in Gaza. It is also unclear whether a massive airstrike earlier this month targeting the group\u2019s military commander, Mohammed Deif, was successful. The Hamas official Moussa Abu Marzouk confirmed that Haniyeh had died during a visit to Tehran for the inauguration of the new Iranian president. Marzouk called the killing a \u201cgrave escalation\u201d that \u201cwill not go unpunished\u201d, although the Islamist movement\u2019s capacity to respond is severely diminished after almost a year of war against Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip. A response could instead come from Hamas\u2019s allies, bringing the Middle East closer to a regional war between Israel and Iran and its proxies. Haniyeh\u2019s death came just hours after Israel claimed it killed a top Hezbollah commander in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, and the region is already bracing for the powerful Shia militia\u2019s reaction. Israel and Hezbollah have been fighting a war of attrition on the blue line that separates Lebanon and the Jewish state since Hezbollah joined the fighting on 8 October, and tensions have soared since an airstrike on Saturday that killed 12 children in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. Hezbollah has denied it was responsible for the attack. Unable to protect one of its most important allies on its own soil, Iran needs to save face. A spokesperson for Iran\u2019s supreme national security council said early on Wednesday that the perpetrators of the Tehran attack would receive \u201ca response\u201d, according to Lebanese network Al-Mayadeen. Iranian state television also said the assassination would prompt \u201cretaliation\u201d from the Shia axis of militias around the Middle East backed by Iran. Several of these proxies, including Yemen\u2019s Houthis, have already fired missiles and drones at Israel and US assets in the region over the last nine months, ostensibly to aid Hamas\u2019s war effort. The people of Gaza and Israeli hostages held in Hamas\u2019s tunnels are the immediate victims here because a breakthrough in the protracted ceasefire talks is now even less likely. As the head of the group\u2019s politburo, based in the Qatari capital of Doha, Haniyeh was a key figure in talks mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the US aimed at a lasting ceasefire and hostage and prisoner release deal. Iranian state television said that Haniyeh\u2019s death would delay the negotiations by \u201cseveral months\u201d. While Hamas is used to having to replace and promote new leaders in the wake of Israeli assassinations, the loss of a globally famous figure such as Haniyeh will have a major operational impact. The 62-year-old Hamas veteran managed the movement\u2019s relationships with allies in Tehran and around the region, including Hezbollah. The politburo leader was also widely considered to be more pragmatic and open to negotiation with Israel than hardliners such as Sinwar, the group\u2019s leader in Gaza. Haniyeh was an early advocate inside Hamas for political and diplomatic efforts alongside armed resistance, and adopted his predecessor\u2019s revised 2017 charter, which implicitly accepted the existence of Israel. The 7 October assault was carried out partly in response to hardening attitudes towards the Palestinians in Israel as the country shifted to the right politically. It has led inevitably to intense scrutiny of Hamas\u2019s apparent previous willingness to pursue a diplomatic solution to the conflict. How much Haniyeh knew about the attack beforehand is not clear, although he was quick to champion it. His removal is unlikely to prompt the group to move towards a more propitiatory position."

The current situation in Ukraine and all of Europe is no less challenging, and we sincerely hope that America\u2019s continued strong leadership will prevent Russian evil from succeeding or making its aggression pay off.\u201d Russia said on Sunday its forces had captured two frontline villages in Ukraine, Andriivka in the eastern Luhansk region and Pishchane in the north-east Kharkiv region. There was no independent confirmation. Separately, Russia said it had scrambled fighter jets to meet two US strategic bombers over the Barents Sea in the Arctic. The US routinely carries out flights over international waters. Strikes on Sunday killed at least five civilians in Ukraine on both sides of the frontline, Russian and Ukrainian authorities said. In the Russian-controlled part of the southern Kherson region, Ukrainian strikes killed a woman, the Moscow-appointed governor said; while in the partially occupied Donetsk region, a married couple were killed when their car was hit, the Russian-installed governor said, adding that a Ukrainian drone strike killed a woman in the village of Verkhnotoretske. In the northern Sumy region, a 37-year-old man was killed by a Russian strike on a combine harvester, the Ukrainian prosecutor general\u2019s office said. Three people were wounded by Russian drone strikes in southern Ukraine\u2019s partly occupied Kherson region, local officials said on Sunday morning. In the north-east, officials in the Kharkiv region said two people were wounded when a village was hit by Russian shells. Nine people were wounded over the previous day in shelling in the town of Shebekino in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region, said the Russian local governor. A US plan to boost Japanese production of Patriot air defence missiles \u2013 used by Ukraine to defend against Russian attacks \u2013 is being delayed by a shortage of seekers units made by Boeing that guide them in the final stages of flight, sources have told the Reuters news agency. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries already makes about 30 PAC-3 missiles each year under licence from Lockheed Martin and can increase that to about 60. The US hopes to increase annual production from about 500 to more than 750 globally as soon as possible, a person familiar with the programme said. Semiconductors and other restricted goods shipped through China and Hong Kong to fuel Russia\u2019s war effort fell by a fifth this year, previously undisclosed US commerce department data shows, but Hong Kong remains a global sanctions evasion hotspot. Smuggling through Hong Kong of common high-priority list (CHPL) items \u2013 advanced components including microelectronics deemed by the US and EU as likely to be used for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine \u2013 fell 28% between January and May, an official told Reuters, while through mainland China excluding Hong Kong it fell 19%. \u201cI think there\u2019s some cause for being at least optimistic that we have been able to slow down some of this trade,\u201d the official said, but added: \u201cChina is still our number one concern.\u201d"

Bus driver charged after pedestrian fatally struck in Brisbane A Brisbane bus driver has been charged with manslaughter after a pedestrian was fatally struck at a city intersection. Police allege Carl James Van Der Wiel, 59, was driving the bus carrying 10 passengers when the pedestrian aged in his 40s was hit at South Brisbane on 28 June. Emergency services arrived about 11.30pm but the pedestrian was declared dead at the scene. None of the bus passengers were injured. Van Der Wiel appeared in Brisbane magistrates court on Friday. He was granted bail and the matter was adjourned until 26 August. - Australian Associated Press The new joint statement from the prime ministers of Australia, Canada and New Zealand reiterated that they were \u201ccommitted to working towards an irreversible path to achieving a two-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians can live securely within internationally recognised borders\u201d. They said this was \u201cthe only realistic option to achieve a just and enduring peace\u201d. The statement included some strong language directed at Israel in the wake of last Friday\u2019s international court of justice ruling that the continued occupation of territory Israel seized in 1967 was illegal under international law: We call on Israel to respond substantively to the ICJ\u2019s advisory opinion, and ensure accountability for ongoing acts of violence against Palestinians by extremist settlers, reverse the record expansion of settlements in the West Bank which are illegal under international law, and work towards a two-state solution. To date, the Israeli government has labelled the ICJ ruling as \u201cnot legally binding\u201d and \u201cblatantly one-sided\u201d. Read more on that issue here: It\u2019s the third time the prime ministers of Australia, Canada and New Zealand have issued a joint statement about developments in the Middle East (the first, in December 2023, was to press for a ceasefire, and the second, in February, was to oppose an Israeli ground offensive in Rafah). Today\u2019s joint statement described the situation in Gaza as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and said the human suffering was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201ccannot continue\u201d. The three prime ministers said they remained \u201cunequivocal in our condemnation of Hamas for the atrocities of 7 October and ongoing acts of terror\u201d, urging the group to \u201clay down its arms and release all hostages\u201d. The prime ministers said Israel \u201cmust listen to the concerns of the international community\u201d, noting that the protection of civilians \u201cis paramount and a requirement under international humanitarian law\u201d. Repeating language from their previous statement, the prime ministers said: Palestinian civilians cannot be made to pay the price of defeating Hamas. It must end. The prime ministers said they stood fully behind \u201cthe comprehensive ceasefire deal, outlined by President Biden and endorsed by the UN security council\u201d, and they called on all parties \u201cto agree to the deal\u201d.

They said further hostilities would \u201cput tens of thousands of civilians in Lebanon and Israel at risk\u201d, a concern that \u201conly makes a ceasefire in Gaza more urgent\u201d.

More details to come. Here is the last installation of AAP\u2019s wrap on cabinet reshuffle talk. With Northern Territory senator Malarndirri McCarthy expected to take the Indigenous Australians portfolio after serving as Burney\u2019s assistant minister, a final cabinet spot remains. It could go to a junior minister such as Albanese\u2019s confidant Pat Conroy, or an assistant minister could be called in. Assistant ministers and senators Tim Ayres, Jenny McAllister and Anthony Chisholm are all viewed as strong contenders to be promoted. \u201cWe are a caucus that is batting very deep ... there\u2019s dozens of colleagues who have very strong capability, very strong capacity,\u201d Ayres said. New assistant ministers would also need to be picked. Northern Territory MP Marion Scrymgour could pick up Senator McCarthy\u2019s assistant Indigenous affairs position. The future of home affairs minister Clare O\u2019Neil is uncertain, with speculation she could be moved sideways into another ministry to allow someone such as frontbencher Murray Watt to take over the portfolio. Burney won the inner-Sydney seat of Barton with more than 50% of the primary vote at the 2022 federal election. \u201cThe most important thing ... is for me to support whoever it is in the role and to give them the space to be able to chart their own path,\u201d she told ABC Radio. - Australian Associated Press More from AAP on cabinet reshuffling. Labor backbencher Kate Thwaites, touted for a potential promotion, said the government was focused on issues rather than on themselves. \u201cOur focus is exactly where it needs to be, providing people with cost-of-living relief, making sure our economy is as strong as possible,\u201d she told Sky News. MP Ged Kearney, another candidate for promotion, said the prime minister \u201chas made it very clear that he has utmost confidence in his cabinet\u201d when asked whether changes were likely to be minor. But the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is pushing for the immigration minister, Andrew Giles, to be sacked over the handling of a high court decision that ruled indefinite detention was illegal. The decision forced the government to release about 150 detainees \u2013 including some who had committed serious offences and served prison time \u2013 and the Coalition has argued more should have been done to keep them locked up. \u201cIf Andrew Giles doesn\u2019t get the flick, I don\u2019t know who does,\u201d Dutton said. - Australian Associated Press More to come Labor MPs are publicly spruiking stability as Anthony Albanese decides on the cabinet team he will likely take to the federal election. Labor\u2019s ministry maintains a factional balance between the left and right, which convene and put people forward through different processes before the prime minister assigns portfolios. Ministers Linda Burney and Brendan O\u2019Connor will retire at the next federal election, which is due by May 2025. They will step back from cabinet immediately to bring in fresh legs as the race to polling day starts to heat up. Albanese has put a premium on stability, having gone the first two years of his term without dumping or moving ministers. Cabinet minister and former Labor leader Bill Shorten, a factional opponent of Albanese, has called for promotions to be merit-based. \u201cLoyalty is not always rewarded but merit should be,\u201d he told Nine\u2019s Today Show today. But he too lauded the longevity of Albanese\u2019s first cabinet. \u201cNormally in a first term of a Coalition government, they lose six or seven of their ministers, so, really Albo set a record for stability,\u201d he said. - Australian Associated Press More to come Nine CEO dodges questions after staff decision to strike Nine CEO Mike Sneesby has been door-stopped by Australian journalists outside his boutique hotel Le Pavillon de la Reine in Paris. Hours after after his newspaper staff in Australia went on strike, a Channel Seven reporter asked Sneesby whether it was appropriate for him to have carried the Olympic torch as part of the relay. \u201cLook guys, (I\u2019ve) just got back from dinner and it\u2019s not really the time to have a chat,\u201d Sneesby said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stop and have a chat to us now?\u201d the reporter said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m meeting my family,\u201d Sneesby said. \u201cYou\u2019re the boss of a media business here for work \u2013 or are you here on a holiday with your family?\u201d the reporter questioned. Victorian premier Jacinta Allan\u2019s comments follow a vote of no confidence by the ambulance union earlier today, in which 97.8% of members endorsed a call to sack Ambulance Victoria\u2019s current executive. About 4200 members supported the move, which called for the minister for health, health infrastructure and ambulance services, Mary-Anne Thomas to appoint new management. Responding to the vote, Ambulance Victoria\u2019s chief executive Jane Miller said the organisation acknowledged the result and was \u201ccommitted to rebuilding the trust of the workforce\u201d. \u201cOur people, along with the patients they care for, are our absolute priority,\u201d she said in a statement. We are negotiating in good faith ... to deliver an enterprise agreement which is fair for all and acknowledges the significant value of our people. Ambulance union secretary Danny Hill said the no-confidence vote was a \u201cmassive wake-up call\u201d to both the Ambulance Victoria board and the Victorian government. He told AAP that paramedics were being \u201csent out like robots, just to continue working hours and hours past the end of their shift\u201d. The biggest factors crippling the ambulance service and our members, are hospital ramping and call-taking accuracy. [Ambulance Victoria\u2019s] response is always \u2018that\u2019s out of our control\u2019. The workforce is sick of hearing that. On the same day, about 150 members attended a rally outside Thomas\u2019 office to raise awareness of the ongoing strikes, the union said. Thomas\u2019 office has been contacted by AAP for comment. - Australian Associated Press Paramedic dispute unsustainable, Victorian premier says Paramedics in Victoria have engaged in five months of industrial action as they continue to call for a new enterprise agreement, which they have been negotiating for 18 months. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, said she was concerned about the \u201cprotracted\u201d dispute between management and paramedics and the situation was not sustainable. \u201cWe do need to see better, harmonious relationships,\u201d she told reporters today. It\u2019s important that the Ambulance Victoria is focused on the hard work of paramedics, not on these ongoing relationship challenges. - Australian Associated Press More to come The Queensland police commissioner, Steve Gollschewski, has faced questions about the Guardian\u2019s \u2018in the box\u2019 watch house investigation in parliamentary budget estimates. Gollschewski said he is \u201cconcerned about the levels of complaints we\u2019re seeing coming out of our watch houses\u201d and has appointed a deputy commissioner with reviewing the culture at police watch houses. Greens MP Michael Berkman asked whether police routinely use isolation cells \u2013 which are supposed to only be used for safety reasons \u2013 for punishment. Footage broadcast exclusively by the Guardian shows one officer telling a young Indigenous female inmate who was put in isolation, \u201cyou were disobeying the rules, missy\u201d. \u201cI would be extremely concerned if that were the case. I\u2019m not aware \u2013 and would think that that would certainly not be what we were doing in a practice. But if anyone has got information otherwise it\u2019d be certainly wanting to hear about it,\u201d Gollschewski said. Gollschewski said he was also \u201cnot satisfied with the explanation\u201d he\u2019d been given so far about another incident at a Brisbane watch house reported by the ABC. The state government overturned the Queensland Human Rights Act last year in order to reverse a court decision banning the use of watch houses for children. Estimates also heard that police unintentionally shared the details of a victim of crime with her alleged attacker in an apparent data blunder. And the police minister, Mark Ryan, announced the rollout of naloxone \u2013 a drug which counteracts the effects of an opiate overdose \u2013 in police tactical first aid kits. Two teenagers have been charged over the alleged vandalism of federal Labor MP Josh Burns\u2019 Melbourne office. Windows were smashed and covered in painted slogans including \u201cZionism is fascism\u201d at the electoral office at Barkly Street in St Kilda, on 19 June. At the time, Burns alleged the damage was a \u201cpolitically motivated attack\u201d and acknowledged that images of the incident might be distressing for people. Police charged an 18-year-old woman and a 17-year-old boy on Thursday with burglary and two counts of criminal damage. The charges included a second incident of alleged vandalism with red paint at a building on St Kilda Road in Melbourne, on 17 July. Here is the full story: Statement from the NSW opposition leader, Mark Speakman, on Gladys Berejiklian: Today\u2019s decision by the NSW court of appeal underscores the legal challenges in contesting Icac findings due to the Act\u2019s limitations on \u2018merits\u2019 reviews. The standards required by law applies equally to everyone. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, Rafqa Touma will see you through the rest of the evening. Take care, and enjoy your weekend! Woman found guilty of 73 charges of wildlife and animal cruelty A Violet Town woman has been found guilty of 73 charges of wildlife and animal cruelty offences for poisoning wedge-tailed eagles and keeping dead wildlife in her freezer. The woman had pleaded guilty to 26 charges relating to the illegal possession of wildlife, after a search of her property found almost 130 dead wedge-tailed eagles. She had contested 47 other charges, including allegations she had laid baits to kill wedge-tailed eagles. In the Victorian magistrates court in Shepparton on Wednesday, magistrate David Faram said he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the woman was involved by intentionally assisting and/or encouraging the commission of the offences, even if he was not able to conclude she was solely responsible. He found she had laid baits that were found in the paddocks in 2019 or was complicit in doing so, and that she must have had some knowledge or involvement in the destruction of the birds. She will be sentenced after a further mention date in September. The Northern Territory government will not renew a lease for Energy Resources Australia (ERA) on the Jabiluka Uranium mine. The lease had been previously granted for for 42 years. Last month, the Northern Territory issued a two-year order to prevent mining and exploration at Jabiluka while the decision was pending on whether to grant the leaseholder a 10-year extension. The state\u2019s mining minister Mark Monaghan said: We have gone through a thorough process to ensure that all stakeholder views have been considered in this decision. The federal government advice, along with the wishes of the Mirarr people, were critical to this process and outcome. As Karen Middleton reported last month, Jabiluka is the site of one of the world\u2019s biggest uranium deposits. ERA, which is majority-owned by Rio Tinto, has held the mining lease since 1991. The mine is surrounded by Kakadu national park and the Mirrar people want the land incorporated into the park. You can read the full background on this from last month below: Greens senator says Great Barrier Reef\u2019s exclusion from \u2018in danger\u2019 list is \u2018triumph of spin over science\u2019 Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson says the decision to keep the Great Barrier Reef off the world heritage \u201cin danger\u201d list is a \u201ctriumph of spin over science and denies the reality of the current prospects for the reef.\u201d (Graham Readfearn reported on this earlier in the blog here). In a post to X, Whish-Wilson said he travelled to Heron Island in April this year to witness the most recent bleaching event at the reef with his own eyes, and \u201cone thing was undeniable - the Great Barrier Reef is in danger\u201d. Just this week Labor announced new permits for gas drilling along Australia\u2019s west and south-east coastlines. If we are to have any hope of limiting warming to 1.5C as dictated in Unesco\u2019s decision, there can be no new coal and gas. Labor remains in denial of this fact \u2026 The more coal and gas mines the Albanese government rips open, the closer the Great Barrier Reef is to becoming irrevocably degraded and changed forever. It\u2019s new coal and gas or the reef \u2013 you can\u2019t have both. Homelessness, harm, health risks for refugee women Specialist homelessness services say domestic violence is the main reason for women who are refugees in Australia seeking their help, AAP reports. An Australian Institute of Health Welfare report has found that one in eight humanitarian entrants (male and female) received support from specialist housing services, compared to one in 50 from the permanent migrant population. Of the humanitarian refugees seeking help, three in five were women. Domestic violence was the main reason (17.8% of the time) that led to housing vulnerability. Refugees were almost twice as likely to be hospitalised or attend an emergency department as other permanent migrants over a five-year period (2016-2021). Falls, contact with objects and transport accidents were the three most common reasons for going to the hospital. But the report also found that humanitarian entrants were being admitted for injuries caused by assault at greater rates (more than six times higher) than other permanent migrants. There are over 210,000 refugees in Australia who have arrived in the last two decades. Overall they are younger (31.8) on average compared to the general population born in Australia (39.3) and other permanent migrants (37.4), according to the latest census in 2021. Three men have been charged over the alleged forced marriage of two teenage children in Perth. The Australian federal police said this is the first time it had laid charges in Western Australia for this crime. The men \u2013 two related to the boy, and one related to the girl \u2013 faced Perth magistrates court today, each charged with one count of causing a person to enter a forced marriage. The maximum penalty is nine years in prison. Police will allege the teenagers \u2013 one aged between 13 and 15, and the other aged 17 \u2013 wanted to date each other, but the relatives told them they would have to be married for cultural reasons. The men then allegedly facilitated the marriage of the children in a religious ceremony last year. AFP detective superintendent Peter Chwal said the legal age for marriage in Australia is 18, and while a child aged 16 to 18 can obtain permission from a court to marry, the person they wed must be an adult. He said forced marriage was a complex crime because it often involved family members as victims and perpetrators. Forced marriage has been illegal in Australia since 2013. Cold front to bring snow to Tasmania, Victoria and NSW this weekend A wintry cold front will bring snow to low levels across Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales this weekend, the Bureau of Meteorology says. Snowfall amounts will be low, it said in a post to X. ADF chief to travel to Fiji and Vanuatu this weekend The chief of the Australian defence force (ADF), Adm David Johnston, will travel to Fiji and Vanuatu from today until Sunday. It will be his first international trip as chief of the ADF, since being appointed in April. In Fiji, Johnston will formally hand over 14 Bushmasters purchased by the Fijian government. In Vanuatu he will attend the commissioning ceremony of RVS Sokomanu, the nation\u2019s new landing craft. Johnston said: Australia and Vanuatu\u2019s bilateral relationship is founded on our shared values and vision for a secure and prosperous Blue Pacific. We recognise the impact of natural disasters across the Pacific and are committed to working with Pacific partners to respond when disasters occur, build disaster resilience and support communities to recover. Striking Nine Entertainment journalists gathered outside the company\u2019s headquarters in Melbourne and Sydney at 11am today to express their frustration with management\u2019s negotiations for a new enterprise bargaining agreement. They have begun a five-day strike which will see the company\u2019s mastheads produced by exempt members of staff, including management. Staff in Melbourne held a homemade replica Olympic torch and posters saying \u201cDon\u2019t Torch Journalism\u201d, references to CEO Mike Sneesby\u2019s decision to run in the torch relay in Paris. Sneesby told staff he is \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d talks had failed to stop the strike. At 11am the majority of journalists at Nine\u2019s newspapers logged off for five days, leaving the following message on the the Age\u2019s rolling news blog: That\u2019s where we\u2019ll leave today\u2019s national news blog. Thanks so much for reading. Last night, editorial staff from the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian Financial Review, the Brisbane Times and WAtoday voted to reject a last-minute pay offer from management. We can tell you the striking staff won\u2019t be posting anything else though, because sources say they have been locked out of the publishing system. They have also been logged out of the internal messaging system, Slack. Senator urges Albanese government to support a truth and justice commission Greens senator Dorinda Cox has urged the government to support a bill for a truth and justice commission. This comes following a report in the Age that the government was considering a minimalist, community-led truth-telling process to \u201cfill the void\u201d on reconciliation after the voice referendum loss, led by local Indigenous groups to unearth local histories. In a statement, Cox called on the government to implement the Uluru statement from the heart in full and back the Greens legislation: A \u2018minimalist\u2019 model will do nothing and certainly won\u2019t allow us to record the pre-colonial history of Australia and make recommendations to the parliament on how to address the ongoing systemic issues, which will bring practical changes to close the gap for our people, we need something stronger like the Victorian model. We cannot change the past, but we can build a better future for First Nations and non-indigenous Australians with a federal truth and justice commission, which will help us to heal and move forward together as a nation. The Nine Network strike, in pictures Here are some photos from the Nine Network newspaper journalists strike, filtering through from AAP: Continuing from our last post: After visits to Laos and Japan, Penny Wong will fly to South Korea where the Australian foreign affairs minister will meet with her South Korean counterpart, Cho Tae-yul, in Seoul. Wong said South Korea and Australia were \u201cbuilding on our strategic alignment with expanded bilateral and regional cooperation, including on the energy transition and economic security\u201d. She said she would then visit the UN Command Buildings in the Joint Security Area within the Demilitarised Zone between South Korea and North Korea, describing it as \u201can enduring symbol of international cooperation in addressing North Korea\u2019s challenges to security and stability\u201d. Wong said her travel to Laos, Japan and South Korea was \u201can opportunity to promote Australia\u2019s interests and deepen collaboration with key partners and regional architecture in pursuit of a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region\u201d. Foreign minister Penny Wong going to Laos, Japan, South Korea The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, is setting off on a trip to Laos, Japan and South Korea. The agenda in Laos this weekend includes a meeting with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), following up on outcomes from a special summit held earlier this year in Melbourne. Laos will also host a meeting of foreign ministers from East Asia Summit countries (in addition to Asean members, this high-powered grouping brings in Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the US). Wong will then travel to Tokyo, where she is scheduled to attend a meeting of the Quad foreign ministers on Monday. It\u2019s the second time Wong has visited Japan this month. (The previous trip was focused on talks with Pacific leaders.) The Quad is a grouping of Australia, Japan, India and the US. It is viewed warily by Beijing, which argues it is an anti-China initiative. Quad members reject such framing. Wong said the Quad was \u201cworking closely with Indo-Pacific countries and institutions to deliver on a positive agenda that responds tangibly to the region\u2019s priorities and most pressing challenges\u201d. Wong said she and fellow Quad foreign ministers would seek to progress \u201ccooperation on infrastructure, supply chains, connectivity, education, research, humanitarian and disaster responses, counterterrorism and security\u201d. The Queensland police has yet to show any \u201cdrastic\u201d improvement in human rights, years after the legislation of the state\u2019s Human Rights Act was passed, parliament has heard. Greens MP Michael Berkman used parliamentary estimates to question human rights commissioner Scott McDougall. \u201cHas the commission identified any shift in the way QPS [Queensland police service] is approaching any human rights complaints that are brought in respect of the police service or QPS officers?\u201d he asked McDougall said the commission is currently collaborating with the police to improve its hiring practices, and they have established a good working relationship. I am yet to see any evidence, though, that that relationship is translating into a drastic improvement in the way that human rights are protected and respected by Queensland police officers. That\u2019s something that\u2019s certainly within my ambit though, it\u2019s certainly a goal of the commission. The state Human Rights Act became law in 2019. \u2018Unprecedented\u2019 bad behaviour at Queensland council elections The head of the Queensland electoral commission has told parliament there was \u201cunprecedented\u201d bad behaviour at this year\u2019s local council elections. ECQ commissioner Pat Vidgen said today: The poor behaviour of candidates and candidate workers in some local governments in March, such as Redlands, was unprecedented. On Tuesday, Labor premier Steven Miles made national headlines by criticising the opposition for using AI to create a TikTok video of him dancing. But Vidgen said the ECQ had few powers outside proscribed election periods and even then their legislation permitted them only to regulate the proper authorisation of electoral material. The threats to electoral integrity in western democracies is more greater than ever. What we\u2019re seeing is the growth of misinformation, disinformation is on the rise, especially across social media platforms. Cyber threats are real, the threat of foreign interference is real to elections. The use of artificial intelligence is expanding. And the physical threats to temporary election staff is rising. Vidgen said the ECQ could and did ask social media platforms to take down problematic posts on social media, but the responses were \u201cinconsistent\u201d. Former New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian has responded to losing her legal challenge against an anti-corruption watchdog\u2019s finding that she engaged in \u201cserious corrupt conduct\u201d, saying: \u201cI always worked my hardest to look after the welfare and interests of the people of NSW.\u201d Berejiklian said: I would like to thank the NSW court of appeal for its consideration of these matters given the limited nature of a challenge that can be made to Icac findings by any citizen. As the court noted, the Icac Act does not permit a \u201cmerits\u201d review of the findings of Icac. The decision of the NSW court of appeal was split 2-1. The dissenting judgment of the president of the court of appeal held that the report was beyond power and that the findings of Icac should be quashed. Serving the people of NSW was an honour and privilege which I never took for granted. I always worked my hardest to look after the welfare and interests of the people of NSW. Berejiklian had argued the finding by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) was invalid because the commissioner, Ruth McColl, was no longer at Icac when the findings were handed down. The decision, handed down earlier today, was split two to one by the three judges presiding over the case. The NSW chief justice, Andrew Bell, and Justice Anthony Meagher rejected the judicial review on all grounds, finding McColl handing down the findings while she was no longer at the commission was valid. In a dissenting judgement, Justice Julie Ward found McColl had made findings she did \u201cnot have the power to make\u201d, and on those grounds would quash the findings of \u201cserious corrupt conduct\u201d. The Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting thunderstorms through the southern interior of Queensland this afternoon and evening: Family \u2018heartbroken\u2019 after Australian\u2019s death in Thailand The family of an Australian man who died in Thailand has released a statement expressing their heartbreak over losing their \u201cbeautiful, gifted, much beloved Liam\u201d. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed on Tuesday that an Australian had died in Thailand and it was providing consular assistance to the family. Multiple outlets reported that the man was allegedly stabbed after an argument at a restaurant. The family wrote in their statement: We are heartbroken at the loss of our beautiful, gifted, much beloved Liam. The world is a poorer place for his passing. Thanks to family, friends and colleagues for their support. We requested that all family members be allowed to mourn Liam\u2019s passing in private. Financial Review reporter speaks to ABC as strike kicks off Hannah Wootton, a reporter with the Australian Financial Review, is speaking with ABC TV amid the Nine Network strike. Asked where negotiations went last night, she said they \u201cfell down on a couple of fronts\u201d \u2013 mainly the need for a pay rise amid inflation. We have had real pay cuts for quite a few years now. We took a 0% pay rises during the pandemic to help the company, this year it\u2019s a cost-of-living crisis \u2013 we really wanted and needed 4%. And the company just wouldn\u2019t come to the table on that despite publishing been profitable, despite last year they reported profits of about $150m after tax, and they just wouldn\u2019t do it for us\u2026 Our papers more profitable than the New York Times. We do a lot with not much, and now they are saying they want to cut that even more. Wootton said there was agreement around AI consultation, and a middle ground was reached on improving diversity in the newsroom \u2013 as well as working towards better conditions for freelancers. When will staff return to the negotiating table? Wootton replied: \u201cWhen they\u2019ve got an offer for us that matches inflation.\u201d Boy, 14, to face Adelaide court on terrorism charges Counter-terrorism detectives have charged a 14-year-old boy in Adelaide after seizing explosives instructions and extremist material, AAP reports. South Australian police said the counter-terrorism and security section had arrested the boy, who was charged with possessing explosives instructions, information for terrorist acts and extremist material. He was refused police bail to appear in the Adelaide youth court today. It is an offence in South Australia to possess extremist material and instructions on explosives. Material that directly or indirectly encourages, glorifies, promotes or condones terrorist acts, or seeks support for or justifies the carrying out of terrorist acts, is considered to be extremist material. Anyone who has information on the possession, production or distribution of extremist material can report it to the national security hotline or Crime Stoppers. It\u2019s just gone past 11am not too long ago, and staff at the Nine Network have begun their walkout: Nine\u2019s newspaper journalists are going on strike from 11am today following a pay dispute with management. Broede Carmody, a state political reporter at the Age newspaper, told ABC RN earlier that the anger among members was \u201cwhite hot\u201d amid job cuts and he was \u201cnot ruling out us taking further action going forward\u201d. Surgeries at Australian hospitals could be cancelled as soon as next week due to an \u201cunprecedented\u201d shortage of intravenous fluids, AAP reports. Australian Medical Association president Prof Steve Robson warned supply concerns in all states and territories could have bigger implications than Covid-19 restrictions. Manufacturing issues and unexpected increases in demand are behind the global shortage of multiple intravenous fluid products, according to the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Several state health departments have warned of supply disruptions, including NSW Health, which issued a safety alert over critical shortages that could last two or three weeks from mid-July. Robson said imminent shortages from next week flagged by local health authorities were yet to be experienced, but they could have huge implications across the health sector. The health system potentially could come to a grinding halt next week if intravenous fluid isn\u2019t available. The surgeon said he was scheduled to perform procedures next week but they would not go ahead if he did not have intravenous fluids. That would affect every surgeon, every anaesthetist and every patient awaiting surgery in the country. That has potentially bigger implications than the Covid restrictions. If any of your colleagues are looking a little bleary-eyed this morning, they were probably up early \u2013 or late? \u2013 watching the Matildas\u2019 first match as part of the Paris Olympics. Bleary-eyed because the match began at 3am AEST, but also because the team were defeated 3-0 by Germany. But all hope isn\u2019t lost, as Kieran Pender writes from Marseille: And so the Matildas find themselves in a familiar position. Backs against the wall. Never say die, and all that. The good news is it is early days in France, with two group stage matches remaining. Plenty of time, in other words, for Gustavsson and his players to turn things around. You can read his full piece below: More on the outcome of Berejiklian\u2019s legal challenge The outcome of former NSW premier Gladys Berejikilian\u2019s legal challenge was split two to one by the three justices presiding over the judicial review. Andrew Bell, the NSW chief justice, who read out the brief orders a short moment ago, said Justice Julie Ward took a different view on ground one of the amended summons. Bell said he would publish Ward\u2019s view, with the written judgment due later today. Berejikilian\u2019s legal challenge was dismissed with costs. Man arrested after allegedly stripping naked on domestic flight A Western Australian man will face court today after allegedly stripping naked and assaulting a crew member on a domestic flight to Melbourne. The 32-year-old was arrested at Perth domestic airport on 27 May after airline staff notified the Australian federal police a passenger had allegedly removed their clothing and assaulted a crew member on the flight. The man was allegedly restrained by members of the crew and the flight was forced to return to Perth airport. AFP said its officers boarded the plane and spoke to the man, who was then escorted off the plane and arrested before being taken for a mental health assessment. The man was charged via summons with one count of assault and one count of offensive/disorderly behaviour on an aircraft. The former New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian has lost her legal challenge against an anti-corruption watchdog finding that she engaged in \u201cserious corrupt conduct\u201d. Berejiklian had argued the finding by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) was invalid because the commissioner was no longer at Icac when the findings were handed down. Berejiklian filed a summons for judicial review in the NSW court of appeal in September. A judicial review, unlike an appeal, is limited to legal missteps and cannot involve challenging the findings of fact. Weather outlook points to soggy spring in the east, dry in the west There\u2019s been a bit of chatter about whether a La Nina will form later this year in the Pacific, making it four years out of five. The event typically brings wetter than average rainfall for much of Australia, particularly in the east. While climate models mostly point to an La Nina forming, the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s own model (Access S2) places more likelihood on neutral conditions. The bureau\u2019s long-range weather forecasts, though, are probably what we should watch more closely. The latest updates for spring and for September-November point to the odds favouring wetter than usual conditions for much of the east. (The leeside of the Great Dividing Range - where most of those in, say, NSW live - should see rainfall \u201cwithin the typical range\u201d.) The west, though, tilts the other way to a drier than usual stint: There\u2019s much less variation for temperatures, whether for maximums or minimums. And that applies to both the coming three months, and for spring itself. To be sure, these are the general forecasts. As the bureau notes, \u201cperiods of cold weather are still possible\u201d, as are dry or wet spells for regions where conditions are currently looking at relatively wet or dry months. Murder charge laid but no sign of missing Melbourne man\u2019s body Police have charged a man with murder after the disappearance of Adrian Romeo, who vanished five months ago and whose body is yet to be located despite an extensive search, AAP reports. Romeo, 43, has not been seen since 10 February, when he told his parents he was going to Greenvale, in Melbourne\u2019s north, to visit friends. His phone and bank cards have not been used since then and police are yet to find a 2004 gold Toyota Camry he was driving. A 58-year-old man has been charged with murder and will face Melbourne magistrates court today. Police arrested him at a Wallan address, just north of Melbourne, about 7.20pm yesterday. The charge follows a search of a Greenvale property involving the dog squad, major crime scene investigators, the State Emergency Service, the Australian federal police\u2019s specialist forensic search team and NSW police cadaver dogs. Anyone with information about the vehicle or Romeo\u2019s whereabouts is urged to contact police. Nine Network newspaper journalists will go on strike from 11am this morning following a pay dispute with management. Broede Carmody, a state political reporter at the Age newspaper, spoke to ABC RN earlier this morning and said the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of members voted to take action and hundreds are due to walk out. Carmody said they were \u201cseeking a fair pay rise that\u2019s in line with inflation\u201d, plus protections from AI and greater diversity measures in the newsroom. The company announced it would rip out up to 90 jobs out of our newsrooms. It\u2019s an awful, awful situation. Carmody noted that the roughly 20 staff currently in Paris for the Olympics were not exempt from the strike action and while it was difficult for them on \u201cthe trip of a lifetime\u201d, \u201cwhat we\u2019re fighting for is really important.\u201d There\u2019s just too much at stake. As to what the paper will look like over the coming days, I think people will see that you can\u2019t put out a proper high-quality newspaper \u2026 without really talented journalists. Carmody said the anger among members was \u201cwhite hot\u201d amid job cuts, and he was \u201cnot ruling out us taking further action going forward\u201d. It\u2019s the worst that I\u2019ve seen the anger \u2026 We took a 0% pay rise during the pandemic to help the company out when everyone else was shedding jobs, and it was really uncertain times. It\u2019s time for the company to help us. Queensland corruption watchdog paid $441k in ex-public trustee\u2019s legal bills Queensland\u2019s Crime and Corruption Commission paid $440,806 in legal bills after a precedent-setting legal case by former public trustee Peter Carne. But it has yet to agree how much to pay the lawyers of former deputy premier Jacquie Trad. CCC chairperson Bruce Barbour revealed the organisation\u2019s huge legal bill in a parliamentary estimates hearing this morning. Barbour said the CCC\u2019s own legal bill totalled nearly a million dollars for defending the Carne case, and $91,000 on the Trad case. Both Carne and Trad challenged the right of the CCC to release reports which were critical of a public figure but which did not recommend \u201cprosecution proceedings or disciplinary action\u201d or after a public hearing. The CCC took the matter all the way to the high court, where Carne ultimately prevailed last September. The judgment also applies to Trad. This post was amended on 26 July 2024 to change the figure in the first paragraph after Barbour told parliamentary estimates he had made an error about the costs. What kind of leader do voters want in these chaotic times? After weeks of chaos on the campaign trail, the new Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, has brought some voters fresh enthusiasm for the US presidential election. But will this early bump propel Harris to the White House? Progressive leaders around the world have countered the chaos of conservatives by projecting calm and by running sensible, risk-averse campaigns. In today\u2019s episode of the Full Story podcast, Bridie Jabour speaks to Guardian Australia\u2019s editor-in-chief, Lenore Taylor, national news editor, Josephine Tovey, and head of news, Mike Ticher, about the politics of being sensible and what voters really want in their leader. You can have a listen below: The bombshell ruling that made it impossible for Australia to delay sanctions against Israeli settlers While much of the Australian media were focused on the latest twists in the US presidential election, the international court of justice (ICJ) delivered sweeping findings against Israel\u2019s conduct in the occupied Palestinian territories, ratcheting up pressure on all governments to take a firmer line. The ICJ ruling comes at a time of significant legal peril for the Israeli government over the way it has conducted its military response to Hamas\u2019s 7 October attacks. In a separate and ongoing case, the ICJ is weighing up South Africa\u2019s allegations that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza. Additionally, the international criminal court will soon decide whether to issue arrest warrants against the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and defence minister (along with three Hamas leaders) for alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes. These are significant accusations and the Israeli government denies them all. In some ways, however, the latest advisory opinion from the ICJ regarding the 57-year-long occupation of territories it seized in 1967, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem, has the potential to have the biggest impact. In case you missed our full analysis overnight, you can continue reading below: As expected, the 21-country World Heritage committee has decided overnight the Great Barrier Reef will not be placed on a list of sites in danger. The committee, currently meeting in India, accepted a set of draft recommendations from Unesco and the International Union for Conservation of Nature that were published last month. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the decision was a \u201chuge win\u201d for Queensland and the thousands of people who relied on it for their work \u201cand a huge win for all the plants and animals that call it home\u201d. Australia was urged by the committee to set more ambitious climate targets and expressed \u201chigh concern\u201d at rates of land clearing in catchments flowing into the reef. Australia will need to submit a progress report by February next year and the committee said it could consider the reef for inclusion on the \u201cin danger\u201d list at its 2026 meeting. The committee has for years been expressing concern at the impacts on the reef from global heating, poor water quality and fishing. No World Heritage site has ever been placed on the \u201cin danger\u201d list because of climate change impacts. The NSW government has granted extended trading hours to licensed venues showing major events live from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, AAP reports. Hotels, bars, clubs, small bars and live music venues could trade until the early morning if they screen Olympics Matildas games or the swimming finals, the government has said. With an eight-hour time difference between Paris and Sydney, the extended trading will give more fans the chance to cheer on their favourite athletes and teams. The special trading hours encouraged a vibrant nightlife for residents and tourists, minister for the night-time economy John Graham said. He said eligible venues did not need to apply individually to open when they screened the Olympics coverage. India charges man for allegedly sexually abusing WA girl, 11, via social media A man has been charged by Indian authorities after allegedly sexually abusing and intimidating a girl from Western Australia through social media, starting when she was 11. WA police said detectives were notified in 2023 of allegations involving an 11-year-old girl in 2020 and that she was the victim of online grooming, sextortion and other online offences from a person she met online. Police allege the abuse continued over several years and \u201ccaused severe trauma to the girl\u201d. Detectives determined the alleged offender resided in India and referred the matter to Indian authorities, who arrested and charged a man from Indore, Madhya Pradesh, with criminal intimidation, transmitting material depicting children in a sexually explicit act, and sexual harassment upon a child with sexual intent. India\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation used geolocation techniques to track the man and execute a search warrant, where they seized incriminating materials, WA police said. It is understood the matter is still going through the Indian court system. Violence against women has declined significantly in the past three decades, AAP reports, but experts warn there is still a long way to go. The latest report card from Our Watch, a leading national organisation in the prevention of violence against women, showed there had been a 66% drop in the number of women killed by men in the past 30 years. The number of young men supporting harmful ideas of masculinity had fallen by 13% since 2018. But the trends came against the backdrop of an increase in the number of women killed by men this year. While the findings were welcome, more work needed to be done, the organisation\u2019s chief executive, Patty Kinnersly, said. In a year where 42 women have [allegedly] been killed by men\u2019s violence, it\u2019s difficult to reconcile we are making progress in ending this national crisis. But when we look at the longer-term picture, we can see significant reductions in the number of women killed by men\u2019s violence, reductions in women experiencing violence and improvements in community attitudes that reject and challenge this violence. 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732), Lifeline 13 11 14 Linda Burney is asked when she realised the voice referendum wasn\u2019t going to be a success. Burney said she held on to hope until the last minute, but historically referendums had always relied on bipartisan support \u2013 which was not reached \u2013 and \u201cthat made things much, much more difficult\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t say it was cooked from the start \u2026 6.5 million Australians voted yes, in Aboriginal communities they voted 80-90% yes, and the most fabulous thing is that we\u2019ve got a group of young Aboriginal people who\u2019ve had a fire lit in their belly and they will take things forward. Q: Will Malarndirri McCarthy, the assistant minister for Indigenous Australians, replace you? Linda Burney said that was \u201cway above [her] pay grade\u201d but that McCarthy was a dear friend: The most important thing is for me to support whoever it is in the role and to give them the space to be able to chart their own path \u2026 Aboriginal affairs is every minister\u2019s responsibility, not just the minister for Indigenous Australians. Burney reflects on career after resigning from politics The outgoing minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, is now speaking with ABC RN after announcing she would retire from politics. She said she would miss the camaraderie of her colleagues, the \u201cfact you can affect lives and make the world a little bit better\u201d, and the thousands of First Nations people she has met throughout her career. Asked what she hoped her legacy will be, Burney replied she wanted to be remembered for her \u201cgrace and integrity\u201d. Burney said she didn\u2019t want the voice referendum debate to turn into a \u201che said she said\u201d and despite the outcome not being what she had hoped for, \u201cwe did move forward with the public discussion\u201d. The outgoing minister said she would be \u201clying\u201d if she said some of the public discussion during the debate wasn\u2019t hurtful, but she chose not to engage with it because the \u201cbroader objective\u201d was more important. Burney said she had no regrets and saw \u201csuch wonderful leadership in the Aboriginal community\u201d and it was time \u201cto give the new minister the space they need to chart their own way\u201d. My job is to support that person as much as I can. MPs quizzed on ministerial reshuffle Labor MPs are being questioned about Sunday\u2019s ministerial reshuffle on breakfast television this morning. As the prime minister announced yesterday, he will unveil a reshuffled ministry on Sunday after Linda Burney and Brendan O\u2019Connor announced their retirement from politics: NDIS minister Bill Shorten made his regular Friday appearance on the Today Show just a moment ago, and suggested he didn\u2019t expect too many changes. We will [have] to wait and see. I am not expecting a lot, but having said that, I guess we will wait and see. We will find out soon enough. Only three more sleeps. Education minister Jason Clare was on Sunrise and said: \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything.\u201d Meanwhile, Liberal MP Sussan Ley, the shadow minister for skills and training opposite O\u2019Connor, wished both him and Burney well. It\u2019s absolutely the prime minister\u2019s decision and when he makes it, everybody finds out, including the nation. Road safety alert issued as fog coats Brisbane this morning The Bureau of Meteorology has warned of fog across Brisbane this morning, reducing visibility and making road conditions dangerous. Journalists from the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian Financial Review, the Brisbane Times and WAtoday will down tools at 11am today after crisis talks yesterday failed to stop a strike at Nine Entertainment\u2019s mastheads. Rallies are planned outside the newsrooms of Nine Entertainment across the country, where union membership is as high as 90%. The industrial action will include the 20 journalists who travelled to Paris for the Olympic Games and who will now have to sit out the opening ceremony and the opening weekend. Management insists its coverage across all platforms will be unaffected. TV staff are not unionised so the broadcasting of the games, for which Nine has the $100m broadcasting rights, is not impacted. The media union said journalists were taking a stand for ethical journalism and wages that keep up with the cost of living. More on the call to release robodebt report\u2019s \u2018sealed\u2019 chapter Continuing from our last post: It means now the Nacc\u2019s inquiry has ended, and at least one AFP investigation has been finalised, the only remaining known investigations lie within a special public service taskforce investigating the actions of 16 bureaucrats. In an update at Senate estimates hearings in May, the Australian public service commissioner, Gordon de Brouwer, said one of the 16 people \u201cdid not meet the threshold to issue a notice of suspected breach\u201d. Seven final determinations \u2013 meaning a finding \u2013 had been given and another seven were still under way. The final outcomes are expected to be made public in the coming months. But the Greens\u2019 social and government services spokesperson, Penny Allman-Payne, said it was now time for those pages to be revealed publicly: The illegal Robodebt scheme saw thousands of innocent people pursued like criminals, yet the members of parliament and senior department officials responsible for this injustice have never been held accountable. And while the victims of the scheme still wait for justice, many of those same people are still trapped in a broken and punitive social security system where aggressive debt recovery practices continue and for-profit job providers can suspend payments on a whim. It\u2019s been more than 12 months since the royal commission handed down its findings and we still don\u2019t know who the commissioner referred for civil and criminal prosecution, despite minister Shorten saying that keeping this information secret was \u201cnot sustainable\u201d. We can\u2019t allow this to get swept under the carpet and lost to history. The chapter must be unsealed and those responsible for so much death, pain and loss must face the consequences of their actions. Greens call for \u2018sealed\u2019 chapter of robodebt inquiry report to be made public A \u201csealed\u201d chapter of the robodebt royal commission\u2019s final report, containing the names of individuals referred to integrity bodies and the police \u201cfor civil action or criminal prosecution\u201d, should be urgently made public, the Greens say. It comes as the Australian federal police revealed on Wednesday it had finalised an investigation into allegations a witness gave false evidence in a hearing. The AFP said it did not find \u201csufficient admissible evidence\u201d that the alleged offender had intended to mislead. The final report, released last July, concluded the robodebt scheme was \u201ccrude and cruel\u201d, a \u201ccostly failure of public administration\u201d and \u201cneither fair nor legal\u201d. Upon the final report\u2019s release, commissioner Catherine Holmes recommended an additional chapter \u201cremain sealed and not be tabled with the rest of the report so as not to prejudice the conduct of any future civil action or criminal prosecution\u201d. At the time, the government services minister, Bill Shorten, said it was not a \u201csustainable position\u201d to keep the chapter a secret forever. He added he didn\u2019t believe Holmes\u2019 directions on the sealed chapter implied a \u201cforever situation\u201d. In June, the National Anti-Corruption Commission (Nacc) announced it was no longer investigating the six individuals referred to the new body, saying it was \u201cunlikely it would obtain significant new evidence\u201d because of a separate public service investigation simultaneously under way. And happy Friday \u2013 thanks to Martin for kicking things off for us. I\u2019m Emily Wind, and I\u2019ll be taking you through our live coverage today. Feel free to get in touch with any thoughts, tips or questions via X, @emilywindwrites, or you can send me an email: emily.wind@theguardian.com. Let\u2019s get started. The former New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian is expected to learn later this morning whether she has succeeded in her legal challenge to findings made against her by the anti-corruption watchdog. Berejiklian filed a summons for judicial review in the NSW court of appeal last September. She argued that Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) findings that she engaged in serious corrupt conduct were invalid because the assistant commissioner in charge of the investigation was no longer at the commission when the findings were finalised. Andrew Bell, the NSW chief justice, is expected to hand down his judgment in the case at 10.15am. He is only expected to read out brief orders, before a written judgment is published later on Friday. Icac had initially been investigating former Wagga Wagga MP Daryl Maguire, who was also found to have engaged in serious corrupt conduct. Maguire was alleged to have used his position to conduct a business helping property developers. After Berejiklian was heard on phone taps, she was called to give evidence at Icac and admitted she had been in a \u201cclose personal relationship\u201d with Maguire for several years, which she had not disclosed to colleagues or family. Icac then investigated a number of grants she had been involved in approving for Wagga Wagga as well as her state of knowledge of Maguire\u2019s business dealings. Berejiklian has maintained she served the public interest \u201cat all times\u201d while in office. The court heard in February that lawyers for Berejiklian argued that viewing a relationship as a \u201cstanding potential for impropriety\u201d is a \u201cblack, depressing and utterly unrealistic view of human life\u201d. Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and I\u2019ll be flagging some of the best overnight stories before Emily Wind takes over. Linda Burney has been praised for her \u201ccourage\u201d and \u201cdedication\u201d after she resigned as minister for Indigenous Australians. She tells our Indigenous affairs editor, Lorena Allam, that her successor must \u201clisten to people, allow people to get to know you and, most importantly, bring people with you\u201d. Meanwhile, our political editor, Karen Middleton, looks at the challenges for Anthony Albanese as he tries to find a replacement for her and outgoing skills minister Brendan O\u2019Connor. Journalists employed by Nine Entertainment\u2019s publishing division have voted overwhelmingly to strike over pay from Friday for five days, hampering the company\u2019s coverage of the Paris Olympic Games due to officially begin overnight, Australian time. Nine is the official broadcaster of the 2024 games, paying $100m for the broadcast rights for this year alone. The stop work action starts at 11am today and includes all newspaper staff covering the Games in Paris, but not television. Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s fight to clear her name of serious corruption findings will be decided in a court of appeal ruling for her and the NSW integrity watchdog. Chief Justice Andrew Bell will deliver his decision today as the former NSW premier fights findings she breached public trust through her covert romance with disgraced party colleague Daryl Maguire. We\u2019ll have all the details as they unfold."

            "title": "Israeli government accused of trying to sabotage Gaza ceasefire proposal",
            "date": "2024-07-07T20:53:17Z",
            "content": "The Israeli government has been accused of attempting to sabotage a US-backed ceasefire proposal, according to Israeli media, by introducing new demands despite previously accepting the plan. Hopes for a ceasefire in Gaza had risen in recent days following reports that Hamas had given initial approval for a new proposal for a phased deal, after ninth months of war since the attack on 7 October. Egyptian officials and representatives of Hamas said the Islamist militant organisation had dropped a key demand that Israel commit to a definitive end to the war before any pause in hostilities, Reuters and the Associated Press reported. Two Hamas officials told Reuters they were now waiting for a response from Israel, where protesters took to the streets on Sunday to press the government to reach an accord to bring back the hostages still being held in Gaza. However, David Barnea, the chief of the Mossad foreign intelligence service, who was dispatched over the weekend to Qatar, where talks are being held, was reported to have provided the mediators with a list of new reservations, according to Israeli media. The Haaretz newspaper cited a source familiar with the details as saying Israel\u2019s new demands were expected to delay negotiations, and that it was not clear whether Hamas would accede to them. \u201cHamas has already agreed to the latest position presented by Israel,\u201d the source told Haaretz. \u201cBut in Friday\u2019s meeting, Israel presented some new points it demands that Hamas accept.\u201d Negotiations with Hamas were expected to last \u201cat least three weeks\u201d before the deal could be carried out, Haaretz reported. Once again, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is facing criticism from opposition parties, media and families of Israeli hostages, who accuse him of undermining efforts to reach a ceasefire and secure the release of the hostages, for his own political survival. \u201cWe appeal to the heads of the security agencies and the negotiating team \u2013 all eyes are on you. Do not let Netanyahu sabotage the deal again. We must rescue all the hostages,\u201d the families said at a news conference near the defence ministry in Tel Aviv on Saturday. As a potential agreement draws near, Netanyahu has shown a pattern of retreating from hostage negotiations. On multiple occasions in recent months, he has been accused of obstructing progress that could bring an end to the conflict, whether through public pronouncements, covert communications, or by limiting the negotiating team\u2019s authority. There are concerns over the substantial influence wielded by the far-right ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, whom Netanyahu relies on for his ruling coalition and who are opposed to a ceasefire. A few hours after Netanyahu sent Barnea to Doha to study the proposal, Ben-Gvir threatened to quit and collapse the governing coalition. In a post on social media on Saturday, Smotrich said he would \u201cnot be part of a government that agrees to the proposed outline and ends the war without destroying Hamas and bringing back all the hostages\u201d. In a statement, Netanyahu said Israel would maximise the number of live hostages returned, and late on Sunday Netanyahu\u2019s office issued a document entitled Principles for a Hostage Release Deal demanding that \u201cany deal enable Israel to resume its offensive operations until it achieves its war goals\u201d, to \u201cprevent Hamas from smuggling arms from Egypt\u201d, and to prevent \u201cthousands of terrorists from returning to northern Gaza\u201d, Haaretz reported. The document, which risks further hindering negotiations, was heavily criticised by the opposition leader, Yair Lapid, who said: \u201cWhat good does this do? We are at a crucial moment in the negotiations, the lives of the hostages depends on this. Why make such taunting announcements? How does this help the process?\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s popularity plummeted after the 7 October attack by Hamas, which exposed serious flaws in Israeli security. Most political observers say Netanyahu would lose elections if they were held now. At an anti-government protest in Tel Aviv on Sunday, Orly Nativ, a 57-year-old social worker, joined the hundreds of flag-wielding demonstrators. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Nativ said. The head of the National Unity party, Benny Gantz, who in June quit the emergency government in a sign of divisions over Netanyahu\u2019s post-conflict plans for Gaza, said: \u201cNetanyahu, not everything depends on you. But you must show commitment, determination and sincere intentions this time as well. You know as well as I do that since the previous proposal, we have lost many of the hostages, who died in captivity.\u201d Pressure is mounting on Israel, as a Gaza ceasefire could also allow for de-escalation between Hezbollah and Israel. The Lebanese group took responsibility on Sunday for a rocket barrage on the Lower Galilee, claiming to have targeted an Israeli military base near Tiberias. An Israeli man was seriously wounded by shrapnel from a rocket impact, medics said. Hezbollah has declared its attacks on Israel to be in support of Hamas and indicated its willingness to halt its assaults if a ceasefire is reached in Gaza. In Gaza, Palestinian health officials said at least 15 people were killed in separate Israeli military strikes across the territory on Sunday. The conflict was triggered on 7 October, when Hamas-led fighters attacked southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages. At least 38,153 Palestinians have been killed and 87,828 injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since then, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said on Sunday.

            "title": "US calls new Hamas ceasefire proposal for Gaza a \u2018breakthrough\u2019",
            "date": "2024-07-04T21:03:33Z",
            "content": "The White House has described the latest Hamas ceasefire proposal for Gaza as a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d establishing a framework for a possible hostage deal, but warned that difficult negotiations remained over the implementation of the agreement. A senior US official said the Biden administration received the latest Hamas offer \u201ca couple of days ago\u201d and had been studying it ahead of a 30-minute telephone call between Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. \u201cThe conversation was detailed, going through the text of the agreement, constructive and encouraging, while also clear-eyed about the work ahead [and] the steps that must be put in place to finalise this deal and then begin the implementation,\u201d the US official said of the call. Netanyahu was due to convene a meeting of his security cabinet on Thursday evening to discuss the Hamas proposal, and is dispatching a negotiating team to the Qatari capital, Doha, for talks with US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators in the coming days. Israeli officials said the delegation would be led, as usual, by David Barnea, the head of the Israeli intelligence agency, the Mossad. The White House predicted that the Doha talks could convene as early as Friday. It said the Hamas proposal was in line with the three-stage peace deal that Biden outlined on 31 May, which has formally been accepted by the Israeli government and endorsed by the UN security council. US officials had said an earlier Hamas response contained elements that were negotiable but some that were not. The White House reaction to Hamas\u2019s new response was much more positive. \u201cI think the framework is now in place and we have to work out the implementation steps,\u201d a senior US official said. \u201cWhat we got back from Hamas was a pretty significant adjustment to what had been their position, and that is encouraging. We have heard the same from the Israelis.\u201d The official stressed that the agreement was not yet final, however. \u201cThis does not mean this deal is going to be closed in a period of days. There\u2019s significant work to be done on some of the implementation steps,\u201d they said. The main obstacle in negotiations until this week had been widely differing views on how the agreement would move from its first phase to its second. The first phase involves the release by Hamas of elderly, sick and female hostages during a six-week truce, an Israeli withdrawal from Gazan cities, and the release of Palestinian detainees held by Israel. The second phase would involve the release of all remaining hostages as well as the bodies of those who have died, a permanent end to hostilities and a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Phase three would mark the start of Gaza\u2019s reconstruction. The transition from the first to the second phase was to be negotiated during the first six-week truce, and the ceasefire would continue as long as good-faith negotiations continued, but Hamas wanted stronger guarantees over the path to a permanent ceasefire. Netanyahu had publicly cast doubt on whether that would happen, vowing to complete the destruction of the militia, which has run Gaza for nearly two decades and which launched a surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October. \u201cSome of the key issues on the transition from phase one to phase two have really been a stumbling block. I think we\u2019ve had a breakthrough in that area,\u201d the senior US official said, without giving details of the text presented by Hamas. \u201cBetween phase one and phase two \u2026 you have to have conditions and arrangements in place. I think that is something that is obvious, but it\u2019s something that Hamas has resisted,\u201d they said, adding that Hamas had dropped its resistance to the imposition of conditions before reaching a permanent ceasefire. The senior US official said many implementation issues to be negotiated in Doha involved \u201csome sequencing and then a release of detainees\u201d. \u201cI have to say, given the recent developments, we do believe there\u2019s a pretty significant opening here, and we welcome the prime minister\u2019s readiness to try to seize that opening by empowering his negotiating team to engage directly in Doha over the coming days,\u201d the official said."

            "date": "2024-07-05T16:18:32Z",
            "content": "Hopes for a ceasefire in Gaza and de-escalation on the boundary between Israel and Lebanon were raised on Friday, as Israel\u2019s intelligence chief was dispatched by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to Qatar to resume stalled negotiations as Hamas reportedly told its Lebanese ally Hezbollah it had accepted a ceasefire proposal. An official for the Lebanese group, which said on Thursday that it had fired 200 rockets into Israel in retaliation for a strike that killed one of its top commanders, also told Reuters that the group would cease fire as soon as any Gaza ceasefire agreement takes effect, echoing previous statements. \u201cIf there is a Gaza agreement, then from zero hour there will be a ceasefire in Lebanon,\u201d the official said. The efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages held for nearly nine months gained momentum this week as Hamas put forward a revised proposal outlining the terms of an agreement, and Israel expressed readiness to resume discussions that had previously come to a standstill. The head of the Mossad intelligence agency, David Barnea, travelled alone to Doha to meet Qatar\u2019s prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, to study proposals from Hamas to pause the nearly nine-month war, the Kan public broadcaster reported, citing senior Israeli officials. He returned to Israel after an initial meeting, and negotiations will resume next week, Netanyahu\u2019s office said late on Friday. The United States appears to hold high expectations regarding the recently resumed contact between Israel and Hamas, with the White House describing the latest Hamas ceasefire proposal as a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d establishing a framework for a possible hostage deal. \u2018\u2018I think the framework is now in place and we have to work out the implementation steps,\u201d a senior US official said. \u201cWhat we got back from Hamas was a pretty significant adjustment to what had been their position, and that is encouraging.

Netanyahu had publicly cast doubt on whether that would happen, vowing to complete the destruction of the group, which had run Gaza for nearly two decades before it launched its surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October. A Palestinian official close to the internationally mediated peace efforts told Reuters the new Hamas proposal could lead to a framework agreement if it is embraced by Israel. He said Hamas was no longer demanding as a pre-condition an Israeli commitment to a permanent ceasefire before the signing of an agreement, and would allow negotiations to achieve that throughout a first six-week phase. The White House said Biden and Netanyahu had on Thursday discussed the response received from Hamas on the possible terms of a deal, and that Biden had welcomed Netanyahu\u2019s decision on resuming the stalled talks \u201cin an effort to close out the deal\u201d. A source in the Israeli negotiating team told Reuters: \u201cThere\u2019s a deal with a real chance of implementation.\u201d A Gaza ceasefire could also allow for the de-escalation between Hezbollah and Israel on the Lebanese boundary. Hezbollah has declared its attacks on Israel to be in support of Hamas and indicated its willingness to halt its assaults if a ceasefire is reached in Gaza. A Hamas delegation headed by the group\u2019s deputy leader, Khalil al-Hayya, briefed Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah about the latest developments at a meeting in Beirut, the sources said. Its deputy secretary general Naim Qassem on Friday publicly indicated that the group is not anticipating a full-scale war with Israel, but remains prepared for any extreme scenarios, in an interview with Russian outlet Sputnik. \u201cThe possibility of expanding the war is not at hand at the moment but the organisation is prepared for the worst,\u201d he said. Mothers of Hamas-held hostages demonstrating in Tel Aviv\u2019s Habima Square urged Israeli leaders to make an agreement. \u201cThere is right now a deal on the table,\u201d said Shira Albag, the mother of 19-year-old Liri Albag, calling on the prime minister to \u201cshow leadership and courage and sign it off\u201d. One of the main obstacles to the negotiations within Israel is the far-right faction of the Netanyahu coalition government. The national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, issued a warning about potentially exiting the coalition during a highly charged security cabinet session on Thursday evening. According to media reports in Israel, Ben Gvir criticised Netanyahu for engaging in private discussions with the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, and top security officials, painting the cabinet as merely a superficial facade. \u201cI want to make it abundantly clear, prime minister, that if you choose to act unilaterally, the consequences are solely your own to bear, and you will find yourself standing alone. I did not receive half a million votes to partake in a government where key security decisions are made outside the collective,\u201d he was quoted as saying. Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this report."

            "content": "White House officials said Israel and Hamas were \u201ccloser now than we\u2019ve been before\u201d to reaching a ceasefire deal as Benjamin Netanyahu met Joe Biden on Thursday to discuss an end to the nine-month conflict in Gaza. The talks at the White House came amid unprecedented political turmoil in the US and domestic pressure on the Israeli prime minster to rescue the dozens of hostages still being held captive after Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack. Netanyahu also met the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, who is likely to replace Biden as the Democratic candidate for November\u2019s election. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to talk about,\u201d Biden said when he welcomed Netanyahu to the Oval Office. \u201cFrom a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\u201d Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting. The president thanked Netanyahu and noted that his first meeting with an Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir, was in 1973, soon after he was elected to the Senate. Biden was expected to put pressure on Netanyahu to commit to at least the first stage of a three-part deal that would see some hostages released in exchange for a temporary ceasefire. A senior administration official said that a framework for the deal had been agreed upon but that \u201cserious implementation issues \u2026 still had to be resolved. \u201cI don\u2019t expect the meeting to be a yes or no,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of like: \u2018How do we close these final gaps?\u2019\u201d At a press conference while the two leaders were meeting, John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, said gaps in the ceasefire deal could be overcome. \u201cWe need to get there soon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are closer now than we\u2019ve been before. Both sides have to make compromises.\u201d The state department spokesperson, Matt Miller, said: \u201cI think the message from the American side in that meeting will be that we need to get this deal over the line.\u201d More than 39,000 Palestinian civilians have been killed in the conflict, and the international criminal court has applied for an arrest warrant to be issued for Netanyahu for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The US does not recognise the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Harris met with Netanyahu separately as she began her late campaign to challenge Donald Trump in November\u2019s presidential election. The vice-president must prove her mettle as a negotiator in one of the world\u2019s most intractable conflicts. During a \u201cfrank and constructive meeting\u201d, Harris said she pressed Netanyahu about the humanitarian situation in Gaza. \u201cIsrael has a right to defend itself. And how it does so matters,\u201d Harris told reporters after the meeting. She said she raised her serious concerns about the scale of human suffering. \u201cI made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there,\u201d she said. \u201cI will not be silent.\u201d She has spoken forcefully about the need for a ceasefire and about the plight of Palestinian civilians in the conflict, and there is a possibility that she could win back some Democratic voters who believe that the Biden administration has done too little to end the conflict or limit sales of arms to Israel. Harris \u2013 the presiding officer of the Senate \u2013 did not attend Netanyahu\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday but released a careful statement saying that her absence should not be interpreted as a boycott of the event. A senior administration official told the Associated Press there was \u201cno daylight between the president and vice-president\u201d on Israel. On Thursday, Harris issued a statement forcefully condemning pro-Palestine protesters who had demonstrated against Netanyahu\u2019s speech in Washington. She said: \u201cYesterday, at Union Station in Washington DC we saw despicable acts by unpatriotic protesters and dangerous hate-fuelled rhetoric. \u201cI condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organisation Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the state of Israel and kill Jews. Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation.\u201d The vice-president added: \u201cI condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way. \u201cI support the right to peacefully protest, but let\u2019s be clear: antisemitism, hate and violence of any kind have no place in our nation.\u201d Netanyahu is also scheduled to meet Trump on Friday at his residence in Mar-a-Lago. The two men have had a strained relationship since Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his victory in the 2020 election, which Trump has claimed without evidence was manipulated. Netanyahu promised \u201ctotal victory\u201d in the Gaza war in a raucous speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, saying that there were \u201cintensive\u201d efforts to bring the hostages home but giving little detail about how that would be achieved. About 40 Democratic lawmakers \u2013 including the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2013 boycotted the speech, and only half of congressional Democrats attended. \u201cBenjamin Netanyahu\u2019s presentation in the House Chamber today was by far the worst presentation of any foreign dignitary invited and honored with the privilege of addressing the Congress of the United States,\u201d Pelosi wrote on X. Thousands protested on the streets of the capital, with both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups saying Netanyahu was using the conflict as cover for his own political problems at home. He did not mention the word \u201cceasefire\u201d or the negotiations with Hamas once during the speech. Instead, he called for expedited deliveries of US arms to \u201chelp us finish the job faster\u201d. \u201cI will not rest until all their loved ones are home,\u201d said Netanyahu during the speech, referring to the families of the hostages, and the hostages. \u201cAll of them. As we speak, we\u2019re actively engaged in intensive efforts to secure their release, and I\u2019m confident that these efforts can succeed. Some of them are taking place right now. I want to thank President Biden for his tireless efforts on behalf of the hostages and for his efforts to the hostage families as well.\u201d It is unclear whether Biden\u2019s recent decision to end his presidential campaign will allow him to use greater leverage to convince Netanyahu to sign on to a deal. \u201cThe framework of the deal is basically there,\u201d said a senior administration official. \u201cThere are some very serious implementation issues that still have to be resolved, and I don\u2019t want to discount the difficulty of those \u2026 There are some things we need from Hamas, and there are some things we need from the Israeli side, and I think you\u2019ll see that play out here over the course of the coming week.\u201d Reuters contributed reporting \u2022 This article was amended on 26 July 2024, An earlier version said the international criminal court (ICC) has \u201cissued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu\u201d. The ICC prosecutor Karim Khan has applied for a warrant, but a decision on whether to grant one has yet to be made."

Thousands of people marched in the city on Saturday as part of an event organised by Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, while many others took part in a counterprotest. A post on Robinson\u2019s X account on Sunday said: \u201cWe can confirm that Tommy Robinson has been detained by police using powers afforded to them under the Terrorism Act 2000.\u201d Kent police said on Sunday night that a man, 41, had been detained at the Channel tunnel in Folkestone under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, which allows police to stop, examine and search passengers at ports, airports and international rail terminals. He was subsequently arrested \u201cfor frustration of a schedule 7 examination\u201d, the force said, and was later released on bail while inquiries continue. The anti-extremism campaign group Hope Not Hate said on Saturday that Robinson \u201ccould face jail\u201d after allegedly screening a documentary against high court orders at the demonstration. The film, Silenced, repeats false claims he made about a Syrian refugee that led to him losing a libel case in 2021. Robinson is due to appear at a high court hearing on Monday accused of contempt of court for making the documentary. While the circumstances of any arrest remained unclear, supporters of the far-right activist gathered outside Downing Street on Sunday after an impromptu protest was called for 4pm. The Met said it was aware of posts encouraging people to protest in London and that any such activity must be lawful. \u201cWe will deploy officers as required to prevent serious disruption or disorder and to deal with any incidents,\u201d it added. The Reform UK party MP Rupert Lowe, responding to the reported arrest, tweeted: \u201cIs this action proportionate and in line with how the streets of London have recently been policed? More details are urgently required.\u201d Before the release of further details by the authorities, others including the X owner, Elon Musk, tweeted questions on social media. The Met had said in advance of Saturday\u2019s protests that about 1,000 officers were being deployed across the capital to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d and ensure the two groups of protesters were kept apart. At least eight people were arrested and several emergency workers were assaulted, according to the force."

            "date": "2024-07-31T16:13:54Z",
            "content": "A former counter-terrorism police chief has accused Nigel Farage of helping incite violence that broke out in Southport after the killing of three children in a knife attack this week. Farage drew criticism from across the political spectrum for remarks he made in a video on Tuesday in which he questioned \u201cwhether the truth is being withheld from us\u201d after the attack on Monday. Neil Basu \u2013 a former senior Scotland Yard officer who was in charge of counter-terrorism from 2018 to 2021 \u2013 said there were \u201creal world consequences\u201d when public figures failed to \u201ckeep their mouth shut\u201d. \u201cNigel Farage is giving the EDL [English Defence League] succour, undermining the police, creating conspiracy theories, and giving a false basis for the attacks on the police,\u201d he said, referring to the far-right, Islamophobic group whose supporters are believed to have been involved in the rioting in Southport. \u201cHas Nigel Farage condemned the violence? Has he condemned the EDL? Fomenting discord in society is what these people seem to exist for,\u201d Basu added. Farage said that it was \u201cquite legitimate to ask questions\u201d. Others who criticised the Reform UK leader on Wednesday included the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, who said Farage had \u201ca level of responsibility \u2026 and it\u2019s not to stoke up what conspiracy theories or what you think might have happened\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a responsibility to say the police are doing a difficult job, local authorities, all of the services that are on the ground,\u201d she said in an interview on LBC. \u201cWe have a responsibility to hold the community together and say let\u2019s get the facts, and then let\u2019s look at what the actual solutions are and what we can do about the horrific situation that we find ourselves in, not to stir up these fake news online.\u201d Farage was also described on Wednesday as \u201cnothing better than a Tommy Robinson in a suit\u201d by Brendan Cox, the campaigner and husband of the murdered Labour MP, Jo Cox. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, founded the EDL in 2009. There was a rapid spread online of misinformation after the attack, with inflammatory far-right narratives rife on the comment threads under posts by Farage and another Reform MP, Rupert Lowe, on their official Facebook pages. Under posts by Farage and Lowe, who echoed Farage by saying there was \u201cmore to this than we\u2019re being told\u201d, comments ranged from predictions of a coming race war, sharing of misinformation, antisemitic tropes and claims of a cover-up. \u201cThis is clearly not a case of accidental mischaracterisation. This is Reform and Farage in particular actively spreading disinformation and actively using insinuation to incite anxiety, concern and inflame emotions,\u201d Cox said. Farage was described as \u201cutterly shameful\u201d by the Tory peer Lord Barwell, the former MP who served as Theresa May\u2019s Downing Street chief of staff. He said: \u201cHe is an MP. If he has questions, he could have asked them in the House of Commons yesterday \u2013 but he wasn\u2019t there. Instead he prefers to encourage those spreading misinformation on here [social media]. Utterly shameful.\u201d Farage had posted a video on X on Tuesday in which he said he had \u201cone or two questions\u201d as he speculated about whether the stabbing suspect was being monitored by security services. \u201cI just wonder whether the truth is being withheld from us. I don\u2019t know the answer to that, but I think it is a fair and legitimate question,\u201d he said. Farage maintained his position in an interview with the PA news agency, insisting he had \u201cmerely expressed a sense of sadness and concern that is being felt by absolutely everybody I know \u2013 \u2018what the hell is going on?\u2019\u201d He added: \u201cI think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to ask what is happening to law and order in our country. \u201cAnd who are the perpetrators? Why? Very legitimate questions I was asking, and to conflate that with EDL or anybody else, frankly, it\u2019s desperate stuff.\u201d The violence against police during the rioting prompted Rayner to raise the prospect of banning more far-right groups. \u201cWe have laws and we have proscribed groups and we do look at that and it is reviewed regularly. So I\u2019m sure that that will be something that the home secretary will be looking at as part of the normal course of what we do and the intelligence that we have,\u201d she told LBC. The home secretary\u2019s office declined to comment. Two far-right groups have been banned in the last eight years. National Action, a racist neo-Nazi group, was proscribed in 2016, followed by the Sonnenkrieg Division (SKD), a white supremacist group, in 2020."

            "content": "Adidas has apologised to the model Bella Hadid after pulling adverts in which she was promoting a sport shoe first launched to coincide with the 1972 Munich Olympics. Adidas last week said it was \u201crevising\u201d its campaign after criticism from Israel over Hadid\u2019s involvement in the campaign for the retro SL72 trainers. Hadid is an American whose family has roots in Palestine. The apology, issued on Instagram, said: \u201cConnections continue to be made to the terrible tragedy that occurred at the Munich Olympics due to our recent SL72 campaign,\u201d referring to the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre when Israeli athletes were taken hostage by the Black September Organization, a Palestinian militant group. Eleven Israelis, a German police officer and five of the attackers died. The statement continued: \u201cThese connections are not meant, and we apologise for any upset or distress caused to communities around the world. We made an unintentional mistake. We also apologise to our partners, Bella Hadid, ASAP Nast, Jules Kound\u00e9, and others, for any negative impact on them and we are revising the campaign.\u201d On Friday, the German-based company had said in a statement it was \u201crevising the remainder of the campaign\u201d after criticism over Hadid\u2019s involvement by Israel on X. \u201cGuess who the face of their campaign is?\u201d read a post on Israel\u2019s official account. \u201cBella Hadid, a model who has a history of spreading antisemitism and calling for violence against Israelis and Jews.\u201d Hadid had previously been criticised by Israel for allegedly chanting: \u201cFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\u201d on a march in 2021. Adidas was condemned by some Jewish organisations, with the American Jewish Committee labelling its decision as either a \u201cmassive oversight or intentionally inflammatory\u201d. Others came out in support of Hadid. One fellow Adidas ambassador, the Palestinian-American author and activist Amani al-Khatahtbeh, posted an email she sent to Adidas on X, in which she said: \u201cBella Hadid is a model of Palestinian origin that has been a much-needed outspoken advocate for human right.\u201d She added: \u201cAdidas\u2019s disappointing response conflates our Palestinian identity with terrorism.\u201d Hadid, 27, whose father is the Palestinian businessman Mohamed Hadid, has been vocal in her support for Palestine. In May she expressed her solidarity by wearing a dress crafted out of red and white keffiyehs during the film festival in Cannes. In 2023 she denounced the far-right Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir for saying Jewish settlers had more rights than Palestinians in occupied territories. When she appeared on the cover of Vogue magazine in 2021, she said on Instagram: \u201cA Palestinian girl on the cover of Vogue. The joy it brings me to say that \u2026 I won\u2019t stop talking about the systematic oppression, pain and humility that Palestinians face on a regular basis.\u201d Hadid, who recently launched her own wellness brand, has faced death threats for her outspoken support. The apology to Hadid and her fellow Adidas partners comes amid reports that she is speaking to lawyers about her options. A trend-setter across fashion, Hadid is perhaps particularly influential in the trainer space \u2013 she was a driver of the widespread popularity of the Adidas It-trainer, the Samba, which has been ubiquitous in recent years. She started wearing the SL72s, which are part of a campaign by Adidas to revive a series of its classic trainer models, earlier this year."

            "date": "2024-07-15T12:06:06Z",
            "content": "The pianist and teacher Maria Yudina was one of the most enigmatic musicians of the Soviet era. A friend of Shostakovich (her student contemporary), Boris Pasternak and Osip Mandelstam, she was an openly devout Christian and a champion of many western modernist composers who were proscribed in the Soviet Union. Although banned from giving recitals for a number of years, she seems to have led something of charmed life during Stalin\u2019s reign of terror, inspiring a number of stories \u2013 almost certainly apocryphal \u2013 about the tyrant\u2019s admiration for her playing. Those stories are one of the starting points for Joe Cutler\u2019s chamber opera Sonata for Broken Fingers, which received its premiere in a concert performance with Sian Edwards conducting Birmingham Contemporary Music Group. It is described rather hopefully as a \u201cdark absurdist thriller\u201d, but what Cutler and his librettist Max Hoehn have produced is an awkward mix of fact and fantasy. In their text, Yudina becomes the pianist and pedagogue Maria Maximova, who has been incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital as what Soviet doctors term a \u201csluggish schizophrenic\u201d, and whose recordings have all been destroyed. Late one night in 1953, Stalin demands that a recording of Maximova playing \u201cBeethoven\u2019s Sonata No 33\u201d (why not a real Beethoven sonata?) is sent to his office by the following morning. No one has the courage to tell him that all of her recordings have been destroyed on his orders, and so the pianist, who has not played for five years and has two broken fingers, is rushed into a recording studio and forced to rerecord the sonata. The story unfolds in 20 snappy scenes, with the text delivered in a mix of speech, declamation and occasional songs sung over ostinatos, pedal notes and rattling percussion from the six-piece ensemble, and punctuated by snatches of a pre-recorded piano, playing what sounds like pastiche Beethoven. Yet it\u2019s all quite uninvolving, because for too much of the opera Maximova is a marginalised character who only comes into focus in the final scene, when she describes her experience of playing at Stalin\u2019s funeral. That at least is a fully fledged aria, which Claire Booth could make the most of; elsewhere she was limited to occasional snatches of rather brittle coloratura. The other singers - Stephen Richardson as the sombre, dark-toned Stalin, Christopher Lemmings as Gleb, the director of Moscow Radio who\u2019s thrown into a panic by Stalin\u2019s demand, James Cleverton as Leonid, the minister of culture who is also Maximova\u2019s brother, Lucy Schaufer as the doctor who is the only one who has qualms about the way in which the pianist is treated \u2013 all did what they could with what they were given, but in the end it was all rather underwhelming."

            "date": "2024-07-14T05:00:42Z",
            "content": "The first official report by the UK Covid inquiry is set to expose a catalogue of failures by the last Conservative government and health officials in the run-up to the pandemic. Lady Heather Hallett, the inquiry\u2019s chair, will issue the report on Thursday and make recommendations to ensure that the UK is better prepared for any future outbreak. The British Medical Association (BMA), the doctors\u2019 union, has urged Hallett in her initial findings to reflect the \u201cappalling failure\u201d to supply doctors and other health workers with the required PPE. The inquiry has been told of a catalogue of failings in preparing for a pandemic during years of austerity under the Tories and the Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition. Former health secretaries Matt Hancock and Jeremy Hunt, as well as former prime minister David Cameron, were among those who gave evidence at the inquiry. An expert report for the UK Covid inquiry by the medical historian Claas Kirchhelle found decisions were taken to reduce the \u201cUK preparedness stockpiles\u201d from 2012 onwards. This included surgical masks and FFP3 respirators, which provide maximum protection from airborne infection. Kirchhelle said the government cuts costs by opting to buy some respirators within weeks of a pandemic being declared, rather than hold them in stockpiles. This procurement was known as \u201cjust in time\u201d. \u201cRelying on [just in time] provision of critical PPE would result in substantial savings,\u201d states Kirchhelle\u2019s report. \u201cHowever the approach also created greater vulnerability should supply chains be disrupted.\u201d According to evidence submitted to Hallett\u2019s inquiry, the minutes of a pandemic flu clinical counter-measures meeting in October 2017 recorded: \u201cThe respirator stockpile will need to be replenished in FY [financial year] 2019/20. Suppliers have been engaged to explore options to further prolong the life of the stockpile and minimize re-procurement.\u201d The challenges in urgently securing supplies of PPE during the Covid-19 pandemic were compounded by failures to deliver the equipment that was expected as part of the \u201cjust in time\u201d contracts. By January 2022, the Department of Health and Social Care had spent \u00a312.6bn on PPE, including contracts with companies referred into a \u201cVIP lane\u201d by Tory ministers and officials. The BMA\u2019s submission to the inquiry stated: \u201cThere is no doubt that the provision of PPE to healthcare workers during the pandemic was hopelessly inadequate, and that the task for the inquiry is to determine why this occurred, to ensure that it does not happen again.\u201d The inquiry is also investigating procurement and is likely to make findings on the responsibility and reasons for these diminished PPE stockpiles. Hallett will examine whether the risk of a pandemic with the features of Covid-19 could have been foreseen and planned for. Lawyers representing bereaved families said there was evidence that a \u201chigh-impact newly-emergent\u201d disease could have been predicted. Instead, the UK pandemic preparation focused on an influenza-style pandemic. There were nearly 220,000 deaths involving Covid-19 from March 2020 to March 2023. The bereaved families say that the policy of austerity undermined health services and made it more likely that \u201ceven a moderate pandemic would overrun the system\u201d. They say civil contingency structures were not fit for purpose, and that they were lacking in policy, leadership and oversight. The Department of Health and Social Care has accepted that PPE was in short supply during the pandemic, but asserts that the UK never ran out nationally. In a submission to the inquiry, it stated: \u201cCovid-19 was a huge shock to the entire world. Our resilience as a society was tested \u2026 The department is committed to learning lessons and implementing change where necessary.\u201d The Covid inquiry is split into different investigations. A second report into \u201cdecision-making and political governance\u201d is expected later this year. The inquiry is due to hear evidence from September on the effect of the pandemic on healthcare systems. Susie Flintham, on behalf of the Covid 19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, said: \u2018We have submitted 71 proposed recommendations which we hope to see included in the inquiry\u2019s report. Bereaved families like mine, who fought to bring about this inquiry, know that the value of the inquiry depends on the strength of the recommendations. The years leading up to this moment have been emotionally draining for everyone whose loved ones were tragically let down by an underprepared government, but we know that the inquiry\u2019s recommendations have the potential to save lives in the future, if lessons have been learned from our experiences.\u201d"

Kevin Davies \u2013 the father of the Wales rugby player Gareth Davies \u2013 set out to \u201cridicule and intimidate\u201d the woman over her health concerns, a tribunal heard. Davies, 62, mocked the employee of his car sales and property business in the days before lockdown after she expressed her health fears to colleagues. The woman had asked fellow workers at Cawdor Cars to socially distance from her \u2013 as was recommended by officials \u2013 because she suffered from psoriatic arthritis and an autoimmune condition. The employment judge Tobias Vincent Ryan said Davies \u201ccoughed in her direction deliberately and loudly, commenting that she was being ridiculous\u201d. Judge Ryan said Davies set out to \u201cridicule and intimidate\u201d the woman with his \u201cgross behaviour\u201d on 17 March 2020 \u2013 a week before the first lockdown was announced. The hearing was told the woman had worked for Cawdor Cars in Newcastle Emlyn, west Wales, between 2017 and 2020 and earned \u00a311 an hour. The company has six branches across south and west Wales. It also has a property rental section where she worked as a property manager for its portfolio, including hotels and housing developments. Judge Ryan found other members of the firm\u2019s management team overheard the coughing incident, but he said when called to give evidence in the tribunal they came across \u201cdefensively and as not being wholly straightforward\u201d. The tribunal heard the woman complained \u201cvehemently\u201d about the coughing incident and resigned from the business less than three months later. Ryan said: \u201cShe resigned at least in part because she was victimised; this was a major and significant factor in her decision. She felt that she was being eased out partly because of her complaints. She was correct.\u201d The judge ordered that the woman receive a payout of \u00a326,438.84 \u2013 with Cawdor Cars handing her \u00a318,000 in damages for injury to feelings and Davies paying \u00a33,841.94 for unfair dismissal and \u00a34,596.90 in interest. Speaking after the hearing, the woman said she was left a \u201cnervous wreck\u201d after Davies\u2019 \u201chorrendous\u201d conduct. She said: \u201cHe knew of my medical condition. He knew I had no immune protection because of the medication I had to take, and he deliberately coughed in my face. I was shaking. I\u2019m not a silly, fluffy person \u2013 I\u2019ve had to put up with a lot in my life \u2013 but it really got me.\u201d Davies\u2019 son Gareth is nicknamed Gareth Cawdor over his connections to his father\u2019s business.

            "content": "Health problems and brain fog can persist for years in people hospitalised by Covid early in the pandemic, with some patients developing more severe and even new symptoms after 12 months, researchers say. They found that while many people with long Covid improved over time, a substantial proportion still had cognitive problems two to three years later and saw symptoms of depression, anxiety and fatigue worsen rather than subside. The scientists studied long Covid in 475 people who were hospitalised with the virus before vaccines were available, to learn whether brain fog, fatigue and mental health problems persisted or emerged beyond the first year. While the researchers had no information on the participants\u2019 thinking skills before they got Covid, cognitive tests two to three years later showed that on average patients\u2019 IQs were 10 points lower than expected for their age, education and other factors. One in nine showed signs of \u201csevere cognitive deficits\u201d, which equate to an IQ 30 points lower than expected. Questionnaires completed by participants showed that many felt moderate to severe levels of depression (47%), fatigue (40%) and anxiety (27%) two to three years after Covid. Rather than improving over time, the symptoms were on average worse two to three years after infection than at six to 12 months. \u201cWhat we already knew before doing the study was that Covid-19 was associated with a greater risk of cognitive problems, depression and anxiety compared with other respiratory infections,\u201d said Dr Max Taquet, an author on the study from the University of Oxford. \u201cWe found that in our cohort there was a substantial neuropsychiatric burden at two to three years.\u201d More than one in four people in the study changed occupation after catching the virus, often because they could no longer face the cognitive demands of their job. Those who fared worse over the years were often among the sickest six months after infection, but the severity of the original illness did not appear to affect their long-term outcome. Although the proportion of patients reporting depression, anxiety and fatigue rose after six months, cognitive problems appeared to improve. Six months after infection, 44% had objective cognitive deficits compared with 33% at two to three years. The work, published in Lancet Psychiatry, led the authors to stress the importance of diagnosing and managing long Covid symptoms early to reduce the risk of people developing a more complex disorder. According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of people with long Covid continues, to grow with 2 million people in England and Scotland now experiencing symptoms. The brain fog many report is equivalent to a six-point drop in IQ, one recent study found. Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study, said the findings were \u201cprofound and alarming\u201d and warned people not to be complacent in the era of vaccines and milder Covid variants. The risk of long Covid has dropped from about 10% in the first wave of infections to about 2.5% today, but that still amounts to a \u201chuge number of cases\u201d, Altmann said. \u201cThere could not be a more stark warning that Covid-19 is ongoing and can still do awful things to you, so it\u2019s worth staying boosted and avoiding reinfection.\u201d The scientists urge caution over the results, however. Only 19% of the 2,500 people invited on to the study took part, and if those who agreed fared much worse or much better than the wider group, it would skew the results. It is also unclear whether people who developed long Covid later in the pandemic, after vaccination, and without being hospitalised, would experience as severe health problems."

            "date": "2024-07-19T15:56:45Z",
            "content": "The UK is probably less well-equipped to cope with a pandemic than it was before Covid because of deteriorating health inequalities, the crisis in the NHS and pressures in care homes, leading experts have warned. The head of the British Medical Association (BMA) said that the overall situation meant the nation would be \u201cstill massively underprepared\u201d when a new pandemic hit. The first report of the official Covid inquiry, published on Thursday, pointed to major failures in government planning and warned that more must be done to improve preparedness. Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, whose department heads up emergency planning, told the Commons on Friday that while there was more to be done, \u201cprogress had been made\u201d under the Conservatives in improving pandemic measures. But a series of experts say this might be fruitless given the worsening situation in many other relevant areas, including declining public health and increasing inequalities, much of it a function of austerity policies. Sir Michael Marmot, professor of public health at University College London and author of a pair of landmark government-commissioned reports into health inequality, said the impact of Covid confirmed his predictions that such a pandemic \u201cwould expose the underlying inequalities in society and amplify them\u201d. He said: \u201cThe lesson to me is that to prepare for the next pandemic, we need to prepare to improve the health of the population. But the health inequalities have got bigger. We\u2019re in a worse state now.\u201d Between 2010 and 2022, statistics for life expectancy in the UK were static, he said. \u201cOver that 13 years, life expectancy did not improve at all. I don\u2019t know another period in peacetime since 1900 where we\u2019ve gone 13 years without an improvement in life expectancy.\u201d The Association of Directors of Public Health, which represents local public health leaders, echoed Marmot\u2019s words, saying that improvements in preventable illnesses such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes would help mitigate the impact of a new virus. \u201cIt is now well-evidenced that products like alcohol, unhealthy food, gambling products and fossil fuels are a strong contributory factor to these non-communicable diseases,\u201d said Greg Fell, the association\u2019s president. \u201cTherefore, to become more resilient, we must invest in reducing the levels of consumption of these harmful products.\u201d There was also a need to better invest in public health, Fell added, saying that now there were \u201csimply not enough properly trained and resourced staff to carry out our role effectively\u201d. Another major weakness raised was the state of the NHS, with Prof Philip Banfield, the chair of council at the BMA, saying the Covid report made it clear \u201cthat we are still massively underprepared for when \u2013 not if \u2013 the next pandemic hits\u201d. He said: \u201cWe went into the pandemic with a sick population, with huge health inequalities, public health services stripped to the bone and the NHS and social care understaffed and under-resourced. \u201cNone of this has improved since and, in many cases, has got worse; this cannot all be blamed on the pandemic itself.\u201d Dr Tim Cooksley, immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said the impact of a new pandemic during an existing winter crisis would be \u201csimply unimaginable\u201d. He added: \u201cThe conclusion that we are less prepared for a pandemic as we stand today is indisputable. Acute hospital services are collapsing. \u201cThere is insufficient workforce and capacity to meet current demands which leads to patients suffering harm and appalling conditions on a daily basis. There are insufficient critical care beds.\u201d The head of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, Dr Daniele Bryden, warned that the UK still did not have capacity in hospital intensive care units to cope with a future pandemic, despite these having played a key role during Covid. This included an uneven distribution of beds and a lack of staff, she said. \u201cOverall, intensive care capacity is not yet sufficiently robust to weather another challenge.\u201d Martin McKee, professor of public health at the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that while Covid had provided \u201ca wealth of evidence\u201d to assist in areas including airborne transmission and treatments, there was little evidence the UK was better prepared overall than in 2020. \u201cNHS performance is demonstrably worse,\u201d he said. \u201cChild mortality, an indicator of social conditions, is worse than in 2020 and inequalities by level of deprivation and ethnicity have widened.\u201d While Covid also highlighted ways to better protect people in care from a pandemic \u2013 a module of the inquiry on this will report later \u2013 people in the care sector warned that it was not necessarily any better able to cope. Jane Townson, chief executive of the Homecare Association, which represents domiciliary care providers, said: \u201cNothing has changed from before. In fact, arguably things are worse. The sector remains in a very weakened state. \u201cUK workforce numbers have decreased by 70,000 over the last two years. The growth in workforce numbers has come solely from international recruitment.\u201d Mike Padgham, chair of the Independent Care Group, a membership organisation for care home operators, said: \u201cWe are as vulnerable now as we were in 2019. Only this week we heard that social care is understaffed by some 131,000 and that an extra 540,000 social care staff will be needed by 2040 to cope with rising demand. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t speak to me of a sector that is ready for anything the world can throw at it \u2013 it says exactly the opposite.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-18T11:21:50Z",
            "content": "Was the UK prepared for Covid? The statutory public inquiry into the pandemic has given its verdict, revealing the impact of austerity and Brexit on the UK\u2019s response and giving bereaved families a measure of vindication and validation. Here are the main points covered in the first of several reports from the inquiry. Lives could have been saved The pandemic caused \u201cgrief, untold misery and economic turmoil\u201d \u2013 all of which could have been reduced or prevented had the UK been better prepared, the inquiry\u2019s chair, Heather Hallett, concluded. Lives would have been spared \u2013 in particular those of the groups worst affected, including people with physical and learning disabilities, those with pre-existing conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s, heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes, and people living in deprived areas and from some ethnic minority backgrounds. As well as the deaths directly caused by the virus, the pandemic caused human suffering indirectly, including wreaking havoc on the NHS, especially on waiting lists and elective care, and increasing levels of mental illness, loneliness, deprivation and exposure to domestic violence. She described the pandemic as \u201cthe gravest and most multi-layered peacetime emergency\u201d. Not a question of if, but when The evidence is \u201coverwhelmingly to the effect\u201d that there will be another pandemic, and it is \u201cnot a question of \u2018if\u2019 \u2026 but \u2018when\u2019\u201d. The next pandemic may be \u201ceven more transmissible and lethal\u201d, and is likely to occur in the near to medium future. Without \u201cfundamental change\u201d, the effort in curbing the spread of coronavirus and the human, societal and economic cost suffered from it \u201cwill have been in vain\u201d. Lady Hallett wrote: \u201cNever again can a disease be allowed to lead to so many deaths and so much suffering.\u201d Hubris and \u2018groupthink\u2019 Hallett wrote that in 2019, there was widespread belief, in part resulting from \u201cgroupthink\u201d in government, that the UK was \u201cnot only properly prepared, but was one of the best-prepared countries in the world to respond to a pandemic\u201d. Yet, she observed, in 2020 \u201cthe UK lacked resilience\u201d, including widening health inequalities, high levels of heart disease, diabetes, respiratory illness and obesity, and an overstretched health and social care system. She noted that proper preparation for a pandemic \u201ccosts money\u201d and \u201cinvolves preparing for an event that may never happen\u201d \u2013 yet this is \u201cvastly outweighed\u201d by the cost of not doing so. She added that the ability of the health and social care systems to respond was \u201cconstrained by their funding\u201d. There was a \u201cdamaging absence of focus\u201d on useful interventions, in particular a test, trace and isolate system capable of dealing with large numbers of cases. There was a \u201clack of adequate leadership\u201d in rectifying contingency planning, including from the former health secretaries Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock. \u201cAll four nations were slow to implement what were important and necessary preparations for a pandemic,\u201d Hallett wrote, noting that resources were reallocated in 2018 towards contingency planning for a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit rather than implementing recommendations from Exercise Cygnus, the government\u2019s 2016 pandemic readiness exercise. The UK prepared for the wrong pandemic The UK had planned for an influenza pandemic, which had \u201clong been considered, written about and planned for\u201d \u2013 yet Hallett noted that the Covid-19 pandemic was \u201cnot without precedent\u201d, and disputed the idea pushed by some officials that it was an unforeseeable \u201cblack swan event\u201d. This preparation was \u201cinadequate for a global pandemic of the kind that struck\u201d, and although reasonable to prioritise, should not have excluded other potential pathogen outbreaks, which have been increasing in number. The international scientific community considered a coronavirus pandemic \u201ca reasonable bet\u201d before 2020, given there were four large coronavirus outbreaks that nearly became pandemics earlier in the 21st century. The influenza response was contained in the sole government pandemic strategy, from 2011, but it was \u201coutdated and lacked adaptability\u201d, including paying \u201cinsufficient attention to the economic and social consequences\u201d and to understanding which people were most vulnerable. The strategy focused on managing the impact of a milder virus where spread was inevitable rather than preventing disease and death. It was jettisoned almost immediately. There was also too much emphasis on advising citizens and trusting them to take precautionary measures they deemed fit rather than considering \u201cwhich aspects of legal coercion to protect the public may be used\u201d, added Hallett. She concluded: \u201cThe processes, planning and policy of the civil contingency structures within the UK government and devolved administrations and civil services failed their citizens.\u201d Radical government reforms needed Hallett urged a \u201cfundamental reform of the way in which the UK government and the devolved administrations prepare for whole-system civil emergencies\u201d, and condemned the government reviews and changes since the pandemic as \u201cfail[ing] on a number of grounds\u201d. She identified several \u201csignificant flaws\u201d in the UK\u2019s response to the pandemic, including a failure to learn from previous outbreaks of disease and properly assess risk, a lack of a coherent strategy, and too narrow a range of scientific advice given to ministers. She said there had been \u201ca lack of openness\u201d in government, and pandemic-readiness exercises were \u201cnot subject to the level of independent scrutiny required\u201d. She recommended taking responsibility for pandemic planning away from the Department of Health and Social Care and creating a single, independent statutory body responsible for whole-system preparedness and response, drawing on both socioeconomic and scientific expertise. This should simplify the \u201clabyrinthine\u201d civil emergency and resilience systems based on complex \u201cspaghetti diagrams\u201d of institutions, structures and systems, and replace these with a single ministerial committee or cross-departmental group of senior officials with responsibility, accountability and \u201ca clear purpose\u201d in each UK nation. This should be underpinned by a new UK-wide whole-system civil emergency strategy, incorporating lessons learned from three-yearly pandemic-response exercises, taking into account health inequalities, and involving the Treasury to produce an economic strategy to consider short, medium and long-term consequences. She recommended improving risk assessment to take into account a wider range of possibilities and not just one reasonable worst-case scenario, improving data collection, and bringing in more expertise from outside the government. Noting that she agreed with the observation by Hunt, a former health minister, that \u201ccollectively we didn\u2019t put anything like the time and effort and energy\u201d into understanding the dangers of pathogens or challenging the consensus, she said in future ministers and officials \u201cmust immerse themselves in the topic, understand it and ask questions about it\u201d. \u201cThe aim should be to end the culture of consensus in which orthodoxy becomes entrenched,\u201d Hallett wrote, adding that advisers should have the autonomy to express differing opinions. Hallett will monitor closely the implementation of the recommendations in each UK nation, and expects many to be in place within six months to a year."
