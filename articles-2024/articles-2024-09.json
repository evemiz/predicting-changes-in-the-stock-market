            "date": "2024-09-18T08:00:03Z",
            "content": "Maybe the true Greek tragedy is the temptation to interpret everything that happens in that country under the long Hellenic shadow of history. It is former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis who suggests here that the 2010s debt crisis was akin to an ancient tragedy, with the likes of him, prime minister Alexis Tsipras and a slowly strangulated populace at the mercy of overweening Olympian (or rather, European) forces. We should probably pay attention to the idea \u2013 but maybe more so to his parting suggestion that this drama doesn\u2019t completely conform to the classical pattern, either. Director Elisa Mantin\u2019s melancholic but partisan film makes it clear that the hubris was on the Euro troika side. Varoufakis, a sympathetic Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a clutch of former Syriza ministers, and others describe the ideologically motivated chastising-via-austerity of the country by a Brussels technocracy for whom, says Varoufakis, Greek democracy was an afterthought. The negotiations took place in brutalising 10-hour Eurogroup meetings that were unrecorded and unminuted \u2013 all the better to spin things in the press later. There is no counter-argument here, partly because the IMF pulled out of interviews at the last minute (making good on Varoufakis\u2019s suggestion that insiders never tell outsiders what happens on the inside). Which makes it easy for Mantin to go all-in on the Greek tragedy notion, notably in a strand that alternates politics with snapshots of the artistic and social resistance that has sustained the country during its years of hardship. But it doesn\u2019t go much beyond lots of ba\u011flama-playing and broad generalisations about the Greek soul; more precise insights about the interplay between art and politics \u2013 especially the latter as a form of theatre and how that applied to the 2010s \u2013 go begging. Twenty-first-century tragedian Varoufakis also notes one crucial difference with the classical model - the debt crisis, supposedly resolved but stretching out into a slow-motion social and psychological catastrophe that continues today, offered no cathartic ending for the Greek people. Public Enemy hints that the country\u2019s experience may have wider significance in future arenas where the fate of the commons is decided by faceless elites with inscrutable agendas. But again the film is vague and speculative on this front when that great Greek tradition, rigorous reasoning, might have provided clearer instructions on how to resist. \u2022 Public Enemy is in UK cinemas from 24 September."

            "date": "2024-09-09T16:25:30Z",
            "content": "Prof Tim Newburn suggests we need a public inquiry into the recent riots (\u201cRacism? Poverty, drink and social media? We still don\u2019t know why Britons rioted a month ago \u2013 and we need answers\u201d, 4 September). This is expensive and unnecessary. Misinformation via social media played a part, or why would people have started attacking asylum seekers in the false belief that they had committed murders? Rightwing rent-a-thugs seized on the opportunity to blame their favourite scapegoat. But these things channelled an anger that was already there. Why are so many people so angry at life in this country that they are prepared to riot, and scapegoat others for it? There has been considerable research into the effect of economic inequality on social cohesion, crime and health. What it shows is that economic inequality makes all of these evils worse. This is not simply about being nice to the poor. The research shows that in highly unequal societies even the better off have a poorer quality of life than they would in more equal ones. Recent polls have shown that people are in favour of increasing taxes on the rich, and this includes the rich themselves. Inequality increased colossally under the last government, with most people\u2019s wealth and incomes decreasing while the richest doubled theirs. The change that people voted for must come, or there will be more and worse riots. The past 14 years have seen a massive transfer of wealth from the less well off to the richest. That must be reversed. Shifting the balance of taxation by a relatively small amount is essential. Reducing economic inequality should be a major goal of this government, and a Labour government above all others should not be ashamed to do it. Dr Robert Forde Retired forensic psychologist, Sheffield \u2022 I am grateful to Tim Newburn for his reminder that \u201crioting is generally an indication that all is not well in the body politic\u201d. While historians will have plenty to contribute to understanding lessons from the past in relation to the origins of such riots, I wonder if turning to literature will provide useful insights. I have been reading Charles Dickens\u2019 novel Barnaby Rudge, set in the 1780s and focused on the Gordon riots \u2013 the days of violent insurrection and looting motivated by anti-Catholic sentiment fanned by key figures in the Protestant Association, particularly the figurehead, Lord George Gordon. The parallels in Dickens\u2019 depiction with what followed from the outrageous events in Southport and elsewhere last month are striking. For social media misinformation, read incendiary and anonymous handbills in 1780. For the anti-immigrant political sentiment of the past decade, read the headstrong \u201cBloody Mary\u201d speechifying in the years leading to the Gordon riots. For the state\u2019s current robust sentencing, read the executions of those manipulated to lead the riots by hidden and unscrupulous politicians \u2013 less likely to be charged. What emerges in Dickens\u2019 depiction of such a riot is the abandonment of all civilised values resulting from the mass hysterical groupthink that \u201cothers\u201d and foreigners are causing problems. The invisible leaders remain the problem. Emeritus Professor John Butcher Bedford \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

            "title": "Can US economic statistics really affect the presidential election?",
            "date": "2024-09-08T13:00:50Z",
            "content": "As another presidential election rears into view, spare a thought for campaign operatives on the eve of the first Friday of each month. Aides used to functioning on little sleep struggle by on even less. Press releases and attack lines are meticulously prepared. As the clock clicks to 8.30am, the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics is refreshed repeatedly on hundreds of laptops and phones, until it finally lands: a 40-page statistical release entitled The Employment Situation. The monthly jobs report is widely seen as a reliable indicator of the health of the US economy. But scrutiny of its contents typically reaches a whole new level in the closing stages of an election campaign. \u201cI cannot tell you the anxiety that you feel the night before, and that morning,\u201d said Teddy Goff, digital director for Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign in 2012. As polling day neared, and each jobs report rolled around, there was a palpable fear that \u201cone bad month could take the entire enterprise down\u201d, he recalled. \u201cHad there been a fluky month in October 2012 of negative growth,\u201d said Goff, \u201cyou\u2019re thinking, \u2018OK, cool, we\u2019ve just lost the White House.\u2019\u201d And so, this Friday, as the first week of September drew to a close, staffers for both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris waited with bated breath on the latest official jobs numbers. Employers added 142,000 jobs in August \u2013 shy of expectations \u2013 and the unemployment rate slipped from 4.3% to 4.2%. Both sides pounced. Joe Biden hailed \u201chistoric gains\u201d for American workers since he and Harris took office, with almost 16m new jobs created; the Trump campaign declared that \u201cwarning lights\u201d were flashing, as \u201cfears of Kamala-induced recession\u201d purportedly mounted. Dozens of news outlets, including the Guardian, reported on the release \u2013 and what it could mean for the election. But does it matter? \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any voter who should change their vote based on Friday\u2019s release,\u201d said Jason Furman, who served as chairman of the council of economic advisers under Obama, \u201cwith the possible exception of the 12 voting members\u201d of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-setting policy committee. \u201cIf you stopped the average person in the street, they would have no idea\u201d how many jobs had been created, or how many people were out of work, in any given month, observed Stephanie Kelton, a professor of economics and public policy at Stony Brook University. And even if they did, \u201cpeople are not moving between camps because of a tenth of a percentage point shift in the unemployment rate,\u201d she added. With a campaign this close, however, anything can shift the dial. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in an election that\u2019s basically tied, even very small events could be the difference between winning and losing,\u201d said Furman. \u201cIn terms of economic data, there are really a very small number of big events between now and election day.\u201d Between now and 5 November, when tens of millions of Americans will cast their votes, there will be two updates to the consumer price index, the closely watched inflation gauge; two more jobs reports; and a gross domestic product (GDP) economic growth estimate for the third quarter. Each will be dissected, debated and described in great detail. The world\u2019s largest economy has reached a critical juncture at the exact moment when the US election kicks into its final gears. When inflation surged to its highest level in a generation two years ago, policymakers scrambled \u2013 and ultimately raised interest rates to a two-decade high \u2013 in an attempt to cool the economy, and bring down price growth. With inflation now heading back towards more typical levels, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has signaled that the central bank would start to cut rates this month. The US labor market now faces greater \u201cdownside risks\u201d, Powell acknowledged. The apprehension about this next phase was laid bare in August, when disappointing jobs data for the previous month triggered a sharp, albeit fleeting, global stock market sell-off. The sell-off was news around the world and brought greater \u2013 negative \u2013 attention to a jobs report that while weaker than expected was still positive. While the US economy has staged a remarkable recovery from the depths of the pandemic, a majority of Americans do not appear to recognize this. A Harris poll for the Guardian in May, for example, found that 55% wrongly believed the economy was in recession. \u201cThere is a degree to which people just perceive the economy to be worse than it is,\u201d said Goff. \u201cPart of it is just that the media has a bias toward negative stuff. The individual murderer gets reported on ad nauseam in the local news. The declining murder rate over the course of three decades doesn\u2019t get any coverage. There\u2019s that same phenomenon attached to the economy.\u201d There also appears to be a disconnection between how official economic data informs voters about the economy and how voters experience it in their day-to-day lives. Does last month\u2019s inflation reading matter when your grocery bill is up by a quarter in four years? How much attention would you pay to August\u2019s nationwide unemployment rate if you, or a relative, had recently lost their job? The Trump campaign, which claims Biden has destroyed jobs and fueled inflation, is clearly seeking the support of those directly affected by economic disruption since 2021. \u201cVoters, particularly the voters that will decide elections, they don\u2019t think about the economy through the prism of any government statistics,\u201d David Plouffe, who managed Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, told the Axe Files podcast in March. He later joined the Harris campaign as senior adviser. Obama won in 2012 with the highest unemployment rate of any re-elected president since 1936. \u201cIt was coming down,\u201d Plouffe noted, \u201cso people felt good on trajectory.\u201d Should the Fed start reducing rates this month, as indicated, \u201cperhaps at the margin, in the tiniest of ways\u201d, some people might start to feel better about the economy, Kelton suggested. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a little bit of a vibe shift in having the rate-cutting cycle begin, and knowing it\u2019s under way.\u201d In a race this close, that vibe shift, or the lack of it, may well decide the race. Could the noise created by a few good or bad economic reports tip the balance? For some time already, there has been a gulf between Americans\u2019 words and actions. Right now \u201cwhen people have to put money behind their statements, they are very optimistic,\u201d said Furman, now a professor at Harvard University. \u201cThey are spending lots of money. Businesses are investing a lot.\u201d And yet, \u201cwhen they talk to pollsters and no money is at stake, they are quite negative,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen they get into the ballot box, will they think more like they do in a store, or when they\u2019re talking to a pollster? No one knows.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-30T10:00:11Z",
            "content": "Kamala Harris\u2019s economic policies proved far more popular than Donald Trump\u2019s plans in a blind test of their proposals. Four of the top five most popular proposals were from the Democratic candidate\u2019s campaign, according to a new Harris Poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. The poll showed strong optimism from Democrats about Harris\u2019s presidential candidacy but \u2013 once again \u2013 highlighted pessimism around the US economy from both sides of the aisle. Americans surveyed were given a list of 12 policy proposals \u2013 six from Harris\u2019s campaign and six from Trump\u2019s. The poll did not say whose campaign the proposals came from. The most popular proposal was a federal ban on the price-gouging of food and groceries \u2013 a Democratic proposal that some leading economists have criticized. Nearly half (44%) of all those polled agreed that it would strengthen the economy. Harris\u2019s price gouging proposal is designed to help address the top economic issue of respondents: cost of living. A majority of those polled (66%) indicated that the cost of living was one of their biggest economic concerns right now. Other Harris proposals that voters liked included expanding the child tax credit (33%) and selected tax breaks for new small businesses (33%). The only Trump plan to break the top five was his proposal to cut taxes on social security benefits (42%). But Trump\u2019s policies are popular with his base: when asked about his proposal for the mass deportation of millions of migrants, 43% of Republicans said it would be good for the economy versus 24% of independents and 15% of Democrats. In more good news for Harris, independent voters, a key group this election, seemed to favor Harris\u2019s policies over Trump\u2019s. Four out of the five top policies selected by independents are from Harris\u2019s campaign. Since Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race two months ago, paving the way for Harris to become the Democratic candidate, she has tried to craft her own economic platform. This has involved shifting away from Bidenomics, which failed to ignite much enthusiasm on the campaign trail. In the Harris/Guardian poll conducted last September, a majority of Democrats (62%) said that while Bidenomics was good in theory, it wasn\u2019t being implemented well. Harris instead has been promoting her \u201copportunity economy\u201d, which focuses on rising costs, rather than issues like infrastructure and manufacturing, which were key components of Bidenomics. The shift in focus seems to be working. Harris\u2019s policies were particularly popular with younger Americans, an increasingly powerful voting bloc.Some 87% of millennials and gen Z voters said that at least one of Harris\u2019s proposals would be good for the economy, versus 79% of young voters who said the same for Trump. Of the four generations polled, millennial voters seemed to be the most onboard with Harris\u2019s candidacy, energized by her appointment after President Biden withdrew. The majority of millennials (59%) said that Harris\u2019s policies are better than Biden\u2019s, compared to just 36% of Boomers. Democratic voters as a whole seem to think Harris turned out to be the better candidate: when asked if their lives would be better if Harris or Biden won the election, 80% of Democratic voters went with Harris. Though Harris has received criticism for being \u201clight on policy\u201d, a majority of all voters in the poll suggested they understand her policies just fine. More than 60% of voters said they understood Harris\u2019s policies on the economy. Slightly more voters said they understood where Trump stands on certain issues more than Harris, but most of the differences were small. The widest gap was seen in how voters understand the candidate\u2019s tax policies, with 70% of voters indicating that they understood Trump\u2019s pledges, while 62% said the same for Harris. \u201cDespite some skepticism that VP Harris has yet to define where she stands, our data shows she\u2019s energized her base \u2013 particularly millennials, who will be the largest voting bloc this election \u2013 by effectively messaging and connecting with them on the issues they are facing as they move more into adulthood: childcare, housing and jobs,\u201d said John Gerzema, CEO of Harris Poll. Across the board, Americans still seem to be down about the economy \u2013 negativity that has persisted since Harris Poll and the Guardian first asked voters their thoughts about the economy last September, and again in May. Since the last poll in May, the economy improved across several key measures. Inflation fell back to 2.5% in August, the lowest it\u2019s been since 2021, and has been going down for the last five months. Though there have been some anemic job growth reports, unemployment is still relatively low at 4.2%. And the stock market has hit record highs in September. And all of this is despite the decades-high interest rates, which the US Federal Reserve only started to cut this month. But Americans are still feeling sour. When asked how they feel about the US economy now, compared with the start of the summer, 35% of respondents said they were more pessimistic, while 29% felt more optimistic (29%). Nearly three-quarters (73%) of all polled said they did not feel any positive effects of good economic news today. A majority of Americans (61%) believe inflation is increasing, when it has actually fallen significantly from its peak in 2022. And nearly half of those polled, 49%, said they believed the US economy was experiencing a recession. The US is not in recession. Though many seem to believe the economy is worse than it really is \u2013 particularly when looking at macroeconomic measures like inflation, unemployment and interest rates \u2013 most Americans are actually feeling better about their own personal financial situations. More Americans indicated they were confident in their overall personal finances (61%) and their ability to afford necessities (72%) compared with May. And when asked if they felt better off financially than their parents, 58% of those polled agreed \u2013 8% more than when the same question was asked last September. As shown with the last two Confidence Question polls, beliefs about the economy tend to be shaped by a person\u2019s political party. Democrats are far more likely to feel better about the economy than Republicans. Half of Democrats, 51%, compared with 30% of Republicans, said they feel optimistic about the future of the US economy. Something that Americans from both parties agree on: they still don\u2019t know who to trust when it comes to learning about the economy. And most respondents (78%) also agreed that most people don\u2019t know how the US economy is actually doing, despite it being their top priority in the election. This survey was conducted online within the US by the Harris Poll from 12 to 14 September 2024 among a nationally representative sample of 2,122. The margin of error for the survey is 2.6 percentage points."

            "date": "2024-09-15T06:00:48Z",
            "content": "Monday will be the 32nd anniversary of Black Wednesday. For younger readers, and older ones with ailing memories, Black Wednesday, on 16 September 1992, was the day the Tories lost their reputation for economic competence. True, they had lost it once before, when the Heath government of 1970-74 fell victim to the inflationary impact of the 1973-74 oil crisis, their economic boom that got out of control, and what became known as the disaster of the three-day week. But it did not take long for the Wilson/Callaghan Labour governments of 1974-79 to fall foul in turn of the same accusation. Public borrowing started to spiral and Labour had to go \u201ccap in hand\u201d to be rescued by a loan from the International Monetary Fund. In came the Thatcher government of 1979-90, followed by the Major government of 1990-97. I have written extensively about what I regard as the mistakes of the Thatcher period, but it was the enforced exit of the pound from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) on Black Wednesday that was universally agreed to have put an end to the Conservatives\u2019 reputation for economic competence. Those were pre-euro days, and the principal motive of Lawson and Major was to tie the pound\u2019s fortunes to the Deutschmark, postwar Germany having had a well-deserved reputation for controlling inflation. Unfortunately, our entry could hardly have been worse timed. German inflation took off as a result of the enormous cost of absorbing the east German economy under the process of reunification \u2013 itself a welcome and historic event. The fact of the matter was that the pound had been attached to the D-mark at the wrong time, at the wrong exchange rate, and for the wrong reasons. The Lawson boom of 1988-89 had led to the second worst recession since the second world war, but the high interest rates imposed by the Bundesbank, the German central bank, to combat German inflation were holding back other members of the ERM. At a meeting of European finance ministers and central bank governors in Bath, Norman Lamont, who had succeeded Major as chancellor, tried to bully the Germans into reducing interest rates and therefore the pressure on the pound. Dr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, took strong exception to this. The German view was that the pound was overvalued, and that it was up to the British to deal with that problem. To cut a long story short \u2013 and the markets were going short of the pound \u2013 the belief that the UK could not maintain an overvalued currency became overwhelming, and speculation forced the pound out of the ERM. This eased our economy\u2019s competitive position, and economic recovery became sustainable. The following Sunday I suggested in my column that Schlesinger should be given a knighthood for having helped the British economy to escape from recession. Well, I can report that, although he was never awarded that honour, my friend Helmut Schlesinger is in fine fettle, and recently celebrated his 100th birthday. Within months, Lamont said he had been \u201csinging in the bath\u201d as a result of the easing of economic conditions. (He had certainly not being singing in Bath after his humiliating experience.) But Major had not been amused by the way Lamont had handled the Bath meeting, and replaced him with Kenneth Clarke, who handed over an economy in reasonable shape to Gordon Brown in 1997. There are swings and roundabouts in economic policy, and it was Labour\u2019s turn again to lose its reputation in 2010, when the Conservatives launched a brilliant, and deeply cynical, campaign to accuse Labour and its supposed overspending for having caused the 2007-09 financial crisis, when it was \u2013 as the then top Treasury official at the time, Sir Nicholas (now Lord) Macpherson, pointed out \u2013 \u201ca banking crisis, pure and simple\u201d. The result of that successful propaganda is that the current chancellor, my (almost) new friend Rachel Reeves, is obsessed by the perceived need to win back a reputation for economic competence. Unfortunately, so far she has been going about it the wrong way: penalising the poor while threatening tax increases for rich investors whom she is supposed to be wooing for investment in the UK. We await her first budget on 30 October. What she should be doing is taking a long-term view of borrowing for investment that should benefit future generations, and a long-, medium- and short-term view that we should apply to re-enter the European customs union and single market as soon as possible, thereby fulfilling the promise in the Labour manifesto (do older readers remember that?) to reduce barriers to trade \u2013 of which the most glaringly obvious is Brexit."

            "date": "2024-09-26T17:43:58Z",
            "content": "It is the season for special pleading, meaning warnings to the chancellor of the dire consequences that will follow if she fiddles with various tax reliefs in her budget next month. In the case of London\u2019s junior stock market \u2013 once known as the Alternative Investment Market, but these days just as Aim \u2013 the chorus is becoming deafening. The \u201congoing viability\u201d of Aim would be threatened if 100% business relief from inheritance tax (IHT) is jettisoned, said Julia Hoggett, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, in a letter to the Treasury reported by Sky News. Stockbroker Peel Hunt thinks the likely initial share price reaction would be \u201ca drop of 20%-30% across the [Aim] index\u201d. Are these forecasts credible and should we care? The answer to the first question is yes. The entire capitalisation of Aim is about \u00a375bn and roughly \u00a311bn can be ascribed to investors who are making use of the current system that allows 100% relief from inheritance tax on shares held for at least two years. Approximately \u00a36bn is held in IHT funds and about \u00a35bn comes from direct investments by founders, families and individuals engaged in IHT planning. It feels plausible that the bulk of that money would head to the exit if the relief was removed. One IHT fund manager says he would be \u201ca forced seller on day one\u201d. His fund, like others, is set up to deliver a tax relief to investors; if it cannot do that, he has a duty to get out. Given that liquidity on Aim isn\u2019t strong under normal conditions, one can see how a rush would become a stampede. Selling would be \u201cfurther amplified by other investors in Aim-listed companies recognising the negative fund flow and deciding to move into other investments,\u201d argues Peel Hunt persuasively. But should the rest of us really be bothered about the removal of a tax break that, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies points out, distorts investment choices and has no inherent rationale? Removal, estimates the thinktank, could raise about \u00a31.1bn in year one for the Treasury, rising to \u00a31.6bn in 2029\u201330. Every little helps if, like Rachel Reeves, you need to fill a claimed \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d and have ruled out changes to income tax, national insurance, VAT and corporation tax. Actually, we probably should care. Aim\u2019s reputation as a lightly regulated casino may be deserved given the number of scandals and collapses that have occurred since its launch in 1995 (think Patisserie Valerie for a recent example) but, equally, one shouldn\u2019t forget about the hits. Fevertree, maker of tonics and mixers, listed a decade ago at a market capitalisation of \u00a3154m and is now worth \u00a3800m. Gamma Communications, a software and services business based in Newbury, has grown its market value tenfold to \u00a31.6bn over a decade. Learning Technologies, a workplace digital learning firm, has increased its market value from \u00a343m at listing a decade ago to \u00a3600m. In practice, many such success stories could transfer to the main London stock market without difficulty. But there would also be a chunk of family-backed businesses that would become easy prey at sunken valuations for private equity, which doesn\u2019t feel like an improvement. The point is that the end of Aim, or just a rapid descent into irrelevance, would cut off a source of funding for growing companies, which would jar with the government\u2019s \u201cgrowth first\u201d and pro-risk-taking message. For all of Aim\u2019s faults, companies have raised \u00a3135bn there since inception and there is a bias towards techie firms, which is usually deemed desirable. None of which is to deny the illogicality of the tax break. The case for survival is only the pragmatic one that sudden removal would create a funding hole in the universe of small- and medium-sized companies. If the relief has to be reformed, Reeves could make the process gradual, for example, by extending the two-year qualifying period or retaining existing rights. Nor is it to deny that Aim ain\u2019t what it used to be \u2013 it had almost 1,700 companies in 2007 and now only 700 or so. But that is also an argument for not clobbering it further."

Shares in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, owner of Truth Social, closed below $17 on Wednesday, reversing all their gains since the company\u2019s rapid rise took hold in January. The former president has been prohibited by a lock-up agreement from starting to sell shares in the firm until late September. While his majority stake in the firm is still worth some $2bn on paper, its value has fallen dramatically from $4.9bn in March. As a business, TMTG is not growing rapidly. It generated sales of just $4.13m in 2023, according to regulatory filings, and lost $58.2m. Nor is Truth Social growing rapidly as a platform. While TMTG has not disclosed the size of its user base, the research firm Similarweb estimated that in March it had 7.7m visits \u2013 while X, formerly Twitter, had 6.1bn. That same month, however, TMTG was valued at almost $10bn on the stock market. The former president is potentially on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of penalties following two civil trials, taking a significant chunk out of his personal fortune. Trump Media has, however, previously insisted that there is no \u201cconceivable sign anywhere\u201d that Trump plans to sell shares in TMTG. After being banned from Twitter and then eschewing the platform once the ban had been lifted, Trump recently returned to X. He participated in a lengthy interview on the platform with its owner, Elon Musk. TMTG\u2019s short-lived surge on the market was driven by its transformation into a so-called \u201cmeme stock\u201d, joining a small bevy of stocks, most famously the video games retailer GameStop, which rattled Wall Street by staging unexpected, volatile rallies. Digital World Acquisition Corp, a shell company, first announced plans to merge with TMTG and take Trump\u2019s fledgling media firm public in October 2021. But the process was stalled by a series of legal hurdles. Earlier this year, as Trump dominated the Republican primaries, and it became clear that TMTG would finally land on the stock market, Digital World\u2019s stock was drawn center stage. The volume of trading in Digital World \u2013 how many of its shares changed hands \u2013 increased exponentially. On one day in December, fewer than 100,000 shares were traded; on one day in January, 29.7m shares were traded. As with other meme stocks, interest was heightened by a flurry of internet memes, urging retail investors to buy in. What made this different was that many of the memes were being shared on Truth Social: the platform owned by the very company Digital World was set to take public. When Digital World and TMTG finally combined in March, it initially poured fuel on the fire. But as GameStop and AMC Entertainment have shown, the peaks reached during these rapid rallies typically set the stage for an almighty crash."

            "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s tiny social media empire slumped to fresh lows on the stock market, hours after his primetime presidential debate with Kamala Harris. Shares in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, owner of the former president\u2019s Truth Social platform, dropped by as much as 17% as of Wednesday morning. They later pulled back, but still closed down 10.5%. While TMTG is still valued at about $3bn on the stock market, after an extraordinary rally earlier this year, it has endured a steep fall in recent months \u2013 retreating more than 75% from its peak in March. Trump has a majority stake in the firm but has so far been unable to sell his shares. This is about to change. The first day that the former president can begin selling shares, if he chooses to do so, is 19 September. He owns nearly 115m shares of the company, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TMTG runs the social media platform Truth Social, which Trump created after he was banned from Twitter, now X, and Facebook after the January 6 Capitol riot. Based in Sarasota, Florida, the company has been losing money and struggling to raise revenue. It lost nearly $58.2m last year while generating only $4.1m in revenue, according to regulatory filings. While TMTG has not disclosed the size of its user base, the research firm Similarweb estimated that in March it had 7.7m visits \u2013 while X, formerly Twitter, had 6.1bn. That same month, however, TMTG was valued at almost $10bn on the stock market. Shares of TMTG have been considered a meme stock by some market experts, which is a nickname given to stocks that get caught up in buzz online and shoot way beyond what traditional analysis says they\u2019re worth. The stock has fluctuated for the past several months, with trading largely driven by individual investors who are typically considered less sophisticated than day traders.

            "date": "2024-09-09T05:39:23Z",
            "content": "Good morning. For a long time, the only people who knew the name Nvidia were tech nerds and gamers. For about two decades the company was trundling along, carving a niche with its specialised computer chips, GPUs, which enhanced image display for computers, and making a tidy profit. But in the 2000s, experts realised Nvidia\u2019s chips could do more than process graphics for video games \u2013 the tech could also be used to process the intricate equations driving AI systems. Nvidia\u2019s decision to take a gamble on AI (and fortuitous timing), led it to eventually becoming the most valuable company in the world for a short time, overtaking Microsoft. Since the launch of ChatGPT, the company\u2019s stock has gone gangbusters, soaring by 239% in 2023. Its CEO, Jensen Huang (pictured above) has become something of a celebrity unto himself, and has been dubbed the \u201cTaylor Swift of tech\u201d. GPUs are now the de facto way that generative AI is powered. But what goes up, inevitably, must come down. Geopolitical tensions, legal problems and concerns about an \u201cAI bubble\u201d have left the $3tn company facing an uncertain future, with $279bn (\u00a3212bn) wiped off its value in just one day last week. To unpick this story, I spoke with tech writer Chris Stokel-Walker. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories Covid | A landmark study has uncovered corruption \u201cred flags\u201d in government Covid contracts worth more than \u00a315bn \u2013 representing nearly one in every three pounds awarded by the Conservative administration during the pandemic. Politics | As many as 50 Labour MPs could refuse to back the government\u2019s controversial plan to cut the winter fuel allowance, despite Keir Starmer urging back benchers to get behind a measure he has conceded is \u201cunpopular\u201d. Healthcare | Almost half of doctors internationally have been sexually harassed by patients, new research has found, prompting calls for medics to be given panic alarms to help repel such behaviour. US elections | Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are in effect tied heading into the final weeks of the election campaign, according to a national poll conducted by the New York Times and Siena College, raising the stakes of Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate. Transport | Local transport authorities across England will be able to run and control bus services under a Labour overhaul designed to \u201csave vital routes\u201d, parliament will hear on Monday. The transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said the \u201cbus revolution\u201d would empower local communities as the government prepares to formally announce measures to make services more reliable. In depth: \u2018You cannot get the AI boom to work without Nvidia\u2019 To emphasise the centrality of Nvidia\u2019s products to generative AI, Chris equates its chips to oil. \u201cYou cannot get the AI boom to work without Nvidia\u2019s products\u201d, he says. Every company wants in on their tech, and it\u2019s theirs if they cough up anywhere between $30,000 to $40,000 per AI chip. And companies are more than happy to fork out those sums \u2013 Nvidia announced record revenues of $30bn in just one quarter. \u201cIf you track Nvidia from its initial public offering in 1999 to when it became the world\u2019s most valuable company, it experienced a 591,000% increase in its share price,\u201d Chris says. So, if the demand is there, why has Nvidia\u2019s value dropped so dramatically? *** Unsustainable growth For two years, Nvidia\u2019s growth has been unprecedented, and investors wanted the company to maintain its momentum. But the simplest explanation for Nvidia\u2019s plateau is that its rise has been unsustainable and time-limited. \u201cPeople thought that Nvidia was going to continue growing at that pace,\u201d Chris says. The company is now in a strange situation where, even though their growth rate is still high \u2013 their revenue was up a record-breaking 15% from last quarter \u2013 it still falls short of market expectations, with shares taking a 7% hit. \u201cPractically any other CEO in the world would be overjoyed with the growth that Nvidia is seeing, but because it\u2019s not like the obscene surges that were seen in prior years people are finding it a little bit underwhelming,\u201d he adds. The jitters around Nvidia\u2019s slowdown is mirroring a wider concern about sky-high valuations in the AI sector. For the last year and a half, Wall Street has been throwing bucket-loads of money into the sector, but now it seems that investors are slightly more reserved, as they become more clear-eyed about the extent to which generative AI is going to become a transformative, world-changing technology. \u201cI think most people still think that there will be an impact, but they maybe don\u2019t think that everything is going to change quite as quickly as many thought,\u201d Chris says. *** Supply chains While Nvidia owns the technology, they do not mine or create the raw materials themselves, leaving them vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. Their primary supplier is the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, and there is apprehension about possible supply chain disruption given the increasing hostility between Taiwan and China. \u201cThere is unease [about what would happen if] China decided to do something to Taiwan, then suddenly, what is already a very tight supply of chips which are being sold as fast as they\u2019re being produced, could become even tighter,\u201d Chris says. It has the potential, he says, to derail the whole supply chain. *** Legal woes A report from analytics platform CB Insights estimates that Nvidia has 95% of the GPU market for machine learning, effectively creating a monopoly. According to reports, the US justice department has begun ramping up an antitrust investigation into whether the company has breached competition laws. \u201cNvidia can, to a degree, both name its own price and terms, so there are some concerns by antitrust officials that the company could be offering perks to those who block-book with them,\u201d Chris says. The US is also highly concerned about Nvidia selling its chips to China, which, they believe, is using the technology to modernise its military capabilities. With a degree of success, Washington has set up a tech blockade by banning the export of advanced chips \u2013 but, as a New York Times investigation found, Nvidia has simply found workarounds and these chips are still ending up in China. *** Is there a bubble? Nvidia is not like one of the many so-called unicorn tech startups of the last decade that were wildly overvalued while offering very little in the way of goods, services or profit. It has sold hundreds of billions of dollars worth of its product and there continues to be huge demand. But Wall Street analysts are split about its future. \u201cSome are saying it\u2019s a boom stock, others aren\u2019t quite as negative yet but they have started winding down their expectations for growth in the last month or so,\u201d Chris says. In a situation where there is a bubble \u2013 and it does pop \u2013 the wider knock-on effect, not just on Nvidia and the tech sector but also on the broader economy, could be significant. \u201cThere is this worry in the air, where people are wondering, are we seeing a replication here of the dotcom bubble,\u201d Chris says. \u201cBut we just don\u2019t have the answer right now\u201d.

            "content": "A fall in US inflation expected to pave the way for further cuts in interest rates pushed stock markets to record highs on Friday. Ending a week of gains that began when the Chinese authorities approved a huge economic stimulus package, the S&amp;P 500 index of major US companies soared above 5,750 to register a near 34% gain on a year ago. Europe\u2019s benchmark Stoxx 600 index rose 0.5% to reach a record high, while the German Dax, France\u2019s CAC 40 and Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 all rose. US annual inflation, measured by the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred index, fell by more than expected to 2.2% in August \u2013 the lowest level since February 2021 \u2013 fuelling expectations that the central bank may cut the cost of borrowing more aggressively than previously forecast at its next meeting in November. The prospect of 0.5 percentage point reduction in the US rather than a more modest quarter-point cut came after figures showed inflation in France and Spain also fell by more than forecast, raising the likelihood of another interest rate cut by the European Central Bank before the end of the year. Recent reports by the International Monetary Fund and the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have shown global growth being held back by a sharp slowdown in the US and China. Some analysts have predicted that without extra measures to boost borrowing and investment, there could be a recession in the US next year and a sharp drop in China from the 5% growth rate target set by premier Xi Jinping. On Tuesday, China\u2019s central bank cut borrowing rates for mortgage holders and allowed investors to borrow more heavily at cheap rates. Later in the week, Chinese leaders vowed to arrest a slump in the housing market and boost growth with an increase in benefits for the poorest and extra funds to local authorities, allowing them to intervene to protect house price values. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: \u201cA veritable feast of economic stimulus measures has led investors to take a more optimistic view of the earnings potential for Chinese companies and foreign ones selling into the country. \u201cLower borrowing costs, smaller deposits for buying homes and more capacity for banks to lend money \u2013 these lay the foundations for greater economic activity among businesses and consumers.\u201d James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said the Fed would be under pressure to maintain the pace of cuts to interest rates after a series of indicators showed the economy was weakening. \u201cThe latest Conference Board consumer confidence report suggests households are becoming much more concerned about job security, which implies intensifying headwinds for consumer spending for all income groups,\u201d he said. \u201cIn an environment where inflation is looking much better behaved, the market pressure for ongoing substantial Fed interest rate cuts will persist.\u201d US data next week could show the unemployment rate rising to 4.3% and the number of additional jobs created falling from an average of 180,000 over the last year to below 75,000. Knightley said that with inflation low and unemployment rising, \u201cwe expect the calls for a second half-point rate cut to grow markedly\u201d. \u2022 This article and subheading were amended on 29 September 2024.

            "date": "2024-09-04T23:01:49Z",
            "content": "The government should award public sector workers \u201centirely legitimate\u201d pay restoration deals despite the tough economic backdrop to make up for more than a decade of real-terms salary cuts, the head of the Trades Union Congress has said. Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the organising body for trade unions in England and Wales, said Rachel Reeves\u2019s decision to deliver real-terms pay rises in July was a \u201ccrucial first step\u201d in dealing with staffing pressures in frontline services. But he said deals that simply reversed 14 years of wage decline \u2013 when public sector pay fell on average by 3.6% in real terms \u2013 would not go far enough to recruit and retain thousands of desperately needed staff, and above-inflation pay awards were needed. \u201cI think restoration of public sector pay is an entirely legitimate aspiration for public sector workers. It shouldn\u2019t be the limit of our ambition. I don\u2019t think that in 2010 the situation was perfect, by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d he told the Guardian. His words are likely to fuel attacks on Labour from the Conservatives, who have accused Keir Starmer of being \u201cin hock to his union paymasters\u201d after settling a series of long-running disputes with striking workers over the summer including junior doctors and train drivers. Nowak defended the summer deals, saying the Tories had \u201cplayed fast and loose\u201d with the pay review bodies over the years, while unions could have a \u201cgrown-up conversation\u201d with the new government. Speaking before the TUC\u2019s annual meeting of unions next week, Nowak said ministers would not be able to rebuild public services without staff, as employers including schools, hospitals and care homes were \u201ctrying to fill a bucket that\u2019s got a hole at the bottom\u201d. The TUC is proposing a new public sector workforce commission that would bring together unions, employers and experts to advise government on improving public services \u2013 with recruitment and retention a priority. Nowak said the unions wanted Reeves to set out a roadmap to rebuilding public services, including fair pay, in the budget in October \u2013 but added that he was \u201cnot kidding\u201d himself that it would happen overnight. While he acknowledged that the government faced a \u201chuge challenge\u201d ahead given its economic inheritance, the unions would expect \u201cbroader shoulders to do the bulk of heavy lifting\u201d on tax rises. He said there should be a \u201cnational conversation\u201d on tax, suggesting there was still scope to equalise capital gains tax with income tax, bring in new wealth taxes and make sure that online retailers paid their fair share to help raise billions for public services. Nowak suggested the \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d currently on display from government on the state of the economy was a \u201cnecessary corrective\u201d from the Rishi Sunak era. But he also appealed to Reeves to \u201cset out what we can do about it\u201d because people \u201cneed to see light at the end of the tunnel\u201d. He was particularly concerned about plans for winter fuel payments. \u201cFor those people just above the threshold, I think the chancellor will want to make sure that we go into the winter without those people feeling that they can\u2019t pay their bills or afford to turn on their heating.\u201d In response to anxiety from some business groups over Labour\u2019s new workers\u2019 rights legislation, Nowak argued that it would \u201ccreate a level playing field\u201d for good employers as they already offered significant rights from day one. He suggested there was a \u201cmismatch\u201d between the business lobby and real-life employers, arguing that the latter sometimes had \u201cknee-jerk\u201d reactions against any changes. Companies he spoke with were more concerned about skills than they were about the cost of new staff. The unions \u201chope and expect\u201d the consultation would deal with implementation rather than watering down the plans, he said, and that the government would recognise \u201csiren voices\u201d in the sector for what they were. Nowak admitted frustration over the right\u2019s description of unions as Labour\u2019s paymasters. \u201cWhat they\u2019re describing is hundreds of thousands of working people who\u2019ve opted to pay 50p, 75p a week to support their union to give them a political voice. It\u2019s the cleanest money in politics.\u201d"

Electricity prices fell by a record 17.9% thanks to government rebates, while automotive fuel was 7.6% cheaper. \u201cExcluding the rebates, electricity prices would have risen 0.1% in August and 0.9% in July,\u201d said Michelle Marquardt, ABS\u2019s head of prices statistics. Renters, though, didn\u2019t get much relief, with the annual increase at 6.8%, slightly lower than previous months. Food and non-alcoholic beverages were 3.4% higher than in August 2023, easing from the 3.8% annual increase registered in July. It was the lowest reading since February 2022. While the inflation slide will be welcomed by households, it is unlikely to sway the Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock. She wants to see the more comprehensive September quarter numbers, due out on 30 October, but is doubtful the drop will be enough yet to prompt an interest rate cut. \u201cThe board needs to be confident that inflation is moving sustainably towards the [2-3%] target before any decisions are made about a reduction in interest rates,\u201d Bullock said on Tuesday. \u201cProgress in getting underlying inflation down has slowed and is likely to have remained slow in the September quarter.\u201d Still, Bullock\u2019s admission that the RBA board did not \u201cexplicitly\u201d consider lifting its cash rate at this week\u2019s meeting shifted market expectations. Investors bet there is about a one-in-four chance of a rate cut in November and a two-in-three chance by December, prior to today\u2019s inflation release. The inflation figures were much as the market anticipated, with the Australian dollar hovering near 18-month highs at just below 69 US cents. Stocks were little changed on the day. David Bassanese, Betashare\u2019s chief economist, noted underlying inflation was less than the 3.5% forecast by the RBA for the December quarter. \u201cIf annual trimmed mean inflation does not once again lurch higher, but continues its recent trajectory lower, there is a growing chance it could reach the mid-point of the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target band by year-end, which would be significantly better than current RBA forecasts,\u201d Bassanese said. \u201cIf so, there would be a good chance the RBA could cut interest rates before Christmas.\u201d Among other key items, the cost of building new homes or major renovations rose 5.1% from a year earlier. This gauge has remained at about 5% for the past year, \u201cwith builders passing on higher costs for labour and materials\u201d, the ABS said. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the August inflation numbers were \u201cvery welcome, very encouraging and very heartening numbers\u201d. \u201cWhether it is rent, energy rebates, our cost-of-living policies are an important part of the story but not the whole story here,\u201d Chalmers said, noting rental increases would have been at an annual pace of 8.6% without the commonwealth\u2019s rent assistance. \u201cWe are seeing right across a number of measures of inflation including underlying inflation that it has come off considerably in the new numbers that we see today,\u201d he said. The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, said however that on average prices had \u201crisen by now 10% since Labor came to power\u201d, with those for \u201cworking families\u201d up by more than 18%. \u201cOur core inflation is higher than every other advanced country, peer country, in the world other than the UK and that is not one I would be wanting to compare myself with just now,\u201d Taylor said."

            "content": "Our main stories today: The anticipated post-election bounceback in the UK economy failed to materialise as activity flatlined in July for a second month, according to the latest official data. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the pre-election stalling of activity in June was followed by another month in which gross domestic product remained unchanged. Although the economy grew by 0.5% in the three months to July, the weak performance of the economy during Labour\u2019s first weeks in power came as a shock to the City, which had been expecting growth of 0.2% on the month. The economy grew by 0.7% in the first three months of 2024, followed by a 0.6% expansion in the second quarter, but the latest ONS figures suggest the recovery from the mild recession in late 2023 has petered out. Price growth continued to soften in the US last month, as the Federal Reserve prepares to cut interest rates for the first time since the start of the pandemic at next week\u2019s meeting. As inflation continues to fade, the consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 2.5% in August \u2013 down from 2.9% in July, and below the 2.6% expected by economists. However, the core rate of inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, remained at 3.2%. The British steel industry has suffered a blow after confirmation that 2,500 jobs will go at the Port Talbot steelworks despite a \u00a3500m taxpayer-backed deal for the south Wales plant. The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, has agreed a deal in which the government will provide \u00a3500m towards the construction of a new greener electric arc furnace at the site, with the plant\u2019s Indian owners, Tata Steel, paying \u00a3750m. However, while the deal secures the long-term future of steel production at the south Wales site, the government was unable to secure guarantees that would save the 2,500 jobs at Port Talbot that Tata was likely to cut over the coming months. Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Take care! \u2013 JK Manchester United\u2019s new chief executive has said that the football club is working towards improving performance on and off the pitch, after posting a financial loss for the fifth year running following a poor 2023-24 season. United have embarked on a number of changes since British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe acquired a 25% stake in the club and over the summer managed to secure new players, many of whom are under 25 years of age. Omar Berrada, who was appointed CEO in July after moving from Manchester City\u2019s parent company, City Football Group, said: We are working towards greater financial sustainability and making changes to our operations to make them more efficient, to ensure we are directing our resources to enhancing on-pitch performance. Our clear objective is to return the club to the top of European football. United\u2019s net loss ballooned to \u00a3113.2m in the year to 30 June, from \u00a328.7m the previous year. This is only the second time since the New York listing in 2012 that the club\u2019s annual net loss exceeded \u00a3100m. Shares were 5% lower in US premarket trading. United finished eighth in the Premier League last season, their lowest position since the league\u2019s inception. This season hasn\u2019t started any better, with two losses in the first three games. Earlier this month, Berrada said manager Erik ten Hag had the full backing of the club. For the coming year, the club expects an adjusted core profit between \u00a3145m and \u00a3160m, and revenues between \u00a3650m and \u00a3670m. It reported adjusted core profit of \u00a3147.7m on record revenues of \u00a3661.8m in the latest year. It said the estimate reflects the impact of recent restructuring initiatives, including plans for 250 job cuts. Gerrit Smit, manager of the Stonehage Fleming Global Best Ideas Equity fund, said: Although largely driven by lower energy costs, the sharp drop in US headline inflation to 2.5% for August removes all uncertainty whether the Fed will start cutting their target rate at their meeting next week. Investor focus has already shifted from inflation to economic growth considerations. James McCann, deputy chief economist at the investment firm abrdn, noted that the core measure of inflation was up a robust 0.3% month-on-month, the largest gain since March. Shelter surprised to the upside, with different measures of rents continuing to show quite a lot of heat. Other services inflation was also quite firm, although core goods prices continue to fall, providing some helpful disinflationary tailwinds to the economy. While the Fed will have wanted a softer print, there is a sense that the inflation story is starting to become yesterday\u2019s news. Indeed, with the pace of private payrolls gains slowing to a 10 year low though this summer, and the unemployment rate trending higher, the deeper concern might be that the economy is losing steam quite rapidly, reigniting the risk of a downturn. Indeed, the Fed looks set to cut rates by 25 basis points at every meeting this year with the bar for larger 50bps moves not particularly high if we were to see further growth scares. Here\u2019s our full story: Here is some instant reaction. Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, said: At first glance, today\u2019s year-over-year inflation data brings a breath of fresh air, hinting that the Fed might have room to cut rates more aggressively. Yet, there\u2019s a twist in the tale \u2013 the Core CPI numbers haven\u2019t painted such a rosy picture, throwing a wrench in the works for rate cuts. The market\u2019s response? The dollar index has found new legs, spelling trouble for gold prices. Meanwhile, equity markets are stuck in limbo as traders chew over the full implications of this mixed bag of data. Consumer price inflation in the United States has slowed more than expected to its lowest since February 2021. The headline annual rate of inflation fell to 2.5% in August, from 2.9% in July, according to official figures. This was below the 2.6% rate predicted by analysts. The US Federal Reserve has already signalled that it will cut interest rates at its meeting next week. However, the core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, stayed at 3.2%, as expected, complicating the Fed\u2019s job. Some more reaction\u2026 Ava Santina-Evans, political correspondent at PoliticsJOE, said on X: The Unite union said it was instrumental in securing the \u00a32.5bn fund for investment in steel, and is in ongoing talks on further investment which should include new lines being installed and generating jobs at both Port Talbot and Llanwern. This should be agreed over the next 12 months. The Unite regional secretary Peter Hughes said the deal avoided compulsory redundancies. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: The two stage government commitment to provide serious funding for steel in South Wales is vital for local communities and the long-term future of the steel industry. The last government was quite frankly asleep at the wheel. The present crisis is a direct result of it failing to invest in the UK steel industry and allowing the companies involved to rundown their operations and let them fall into disrepair. Conservative inaction and disdain have resulted in wholly avoidable job losses. Unite which secured the additional funding will ensure that the substantial second stage investment in South Wales means new jobs will be available and secure the future of Port Talbot and Llanwern. It is now imperative on Tata to bring forward the second stage proposals to develop increased steel capacity at its South Wales sites, a jobless transition will not occur on our watch. Speaking in parliament, Reynolds defended the deal, though. This will save more jobs. That\u2019s the point of the new investment. And for those people who are unable to get those new jobs, there will be better terms for them. The unions have recognised it as a better deal. Our Welsh Labour government has recognised it as a better deal. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, has apologised, and said he recognised the deal \u201cfalls short of what would be my ideal\u201d. He told the Commons: The last government had been promising a plan for the steel industry for years. With what I\u2019m able to announce today, with the signing of a legally-binding deal that enables Tata to order their electric arc furnace as part of a significantly improved package, this government has made more progress in two months than they made over the last parliament. But even if we had started these negotiations a year ago, never mind many years ago as they had the opportunity to do, I have no doubt we would have secured an even better deal for the community, so I would like to start with an apology to the people of Port Talbot because they were let down by the previous government. Whilst this deal is much improved, I acknowledge very much it falls short of what would be my ideal. Reynolds had previously said he believed there was a \u201cbetter deal available\u201d and that Labour would ensure that job guarantees in return for investment were part of the negotiations, my colleague Jack Simpson reports. The Guardian understands that Reynolds had initially hoped to persuade Tata to keep the second blast furnace switched on at the site and secure more jobs but this was rejected by Tata because of the costs. The last blast furnace will now close on 28 September, with most employees leaving before Christmas after working their notice periods. Tata predicts that nearly all of the Port Talbot staff will be gone by March next year. Despite the job losses, Reynolds said the deal did what the previous government\u2019s deal could not do, and gave \u201chope for the future of steelmaking in south Wales\u201d. Here is our full story: The government has announced a \u00a3500m taxpayer-backed deal for the Port Talbot steelworks, securing the long-term future of steel production at the south Wales site, but was unable to secure guarantees that would save the 2,500 jobs that Tata Steel is likely to cut over the coming months. The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, has agreed a deal under which the government will provide \u00a3500m towards the construction of a new greener electric arc furnace at the site, with the plant\u2019s Indian owners Tata Steel paying \u00a3750m. Reynolds claimed the deal went much further than the previous government\u2019s agreement \u2013 delivering a minimum voluntary redundancy payout of \u00a315,000 for full-time employees plus a \u00a35,000 \u2018retention\u2019 payment and offering paid-for training. The government said 2,000 workers had expressed interest in voluntary redundancy under this deal. Employees who choose redundancy will be paid 2.8 weeks\u2019 earnings for each year of service, up to a maximum of 25 years. About 500 new jobs are expected to be created to construct the Electric Arc Furnace, but this won\u2019t happen until early 2028 at the earliest. The government is putting \u00a3500m into the steelworks, but said it can claw back investment should Tata Steel not fulfil its commitments. This includes \u201cincreased penalty payments should the company not retain 5,000 jobs across its UK business post transformation\u201d. The government has also pledged \u00a32.5bn of investment to rebuild the industry and help it decarbonise, and said it would lay out a steel strategy next spring. As part of the deal, Tata Steel will release 385 acres of the site for redevelopment, which is expected to bring in more companies and employers not just from the steel sector but other industries. It comes after Tata\u2019s decision in January to close both blast furnaces at its Port Talbot site, putting 2,800 jobs at risk. The business secretary said: Port Talbot has always been and will always be a steelmaking town. This deal does what previous deals failed to do \u2013 give hope for the future of steelmaking in South Wales. Steel is fundamental to the UK\u2019s economy, sovereignty, and communities, but previous government inaction has blighted the steelmaking industry. That\u2019s why this Government is taking strong action through a new deal and strategy which will reverse the industry\u2019s stagnation and set out a long-term vision for a bright and sustainable future. We know that a cleaner, greener future for UK steelmaking is vital to the industry\u2019s long-term economic stability. The road ahead is not without its challenges but our steel strategy will set forth a positive vision for the future of the industry, backed by our manifesto commitment to \u00a33 billion of government investment. Boohoo is closing is US distribution centre just over a year after it opened in the latest sign of cost cutting at the struggling online fashion seller which owns brands including Debenhams, Warehouse and Karen Millen. Analysts said the closure of the site in Pennsylvania was likely to mean a \u00a334m profit writedown on the capital investment in the site, which had been distributing the group\u2019s Pretty Little Thing brand and had been intended to handle more brands later this year. Katie Cousins, an equity analyst at Shore Capital said: To us, the short life of the US warehouse (previously stated as a key pillar of growth for BOO) is concerning, highlighting a naivety of the American market, along with a waste of time and resources. Boohoo said it would continue to serve US customers via its UK warehouse and was testing new routes into the market including the recent launch of its Nasty Gal brand in Nordstrom department stores. These changes will result in a significant reduction in ongoing costs over the medium term. The group remains excited about the opportunity in the US. The closure of the US site comes as analysts said Boohoo\u2019s sales there were well below 2022 levels and forecasts from that time. The group racked up net debts of \u00a395m in the year to the end of February \u2013 down from almost \u00a36m of net cash a year before \u2013 after losses widened 76% to \u00a3160m and sales fell to \u00a31.8bn. Boohoo and fellow online fashion seller Asos have both been struggling amid new competition from cut-price online sellers Shein and Temu as well as the rise in popularity of secondhand clothing among young people spurred on by the likes of Vinted and Depop. Yesterday, Pretty Little Thing founder Umar Kamani, the son of Boohoo\u2019s founder and chairman Mahmud Kamani, said he was returning to run the brand, which he stepped down from in April last year. He said one of his first steps would be to reintroduce free returns for premium customers adding \u201cI sincerely apologise for any negative experiences you may have encountered during my absence.\u201d Drivers working for Bolt, the ride-hailing app operator, are seeking to be classed as workers rather than self-employed contractors at an employment tribunal. More than 12,500 drivers, who are represented by the law firm Leigh Day, are bringing the action against Bolt, an Estonia-based ride-hailing app which has been operating in the UK since 2019. The drivers claim they should be treated as workers because of the significant control Bolt has over how they work, and say they should be given the same rights and protections as typical workers. The high-profile employment rights case, which begins in central London on Wednesday, comes as the new Labour government prepares to draw up its plans to strengthen workers\u2019 rights in legislation. The TV production sector in the UK suffered a \u00a3400m fall in revenues last year as cash-strapped British broadcasters reduced spending to the lowest level since the height of the pandemic. The latest annual industry survey found that total revenues made by UK production companies fell by \u00a3392m to \u00a33.61bn in 2023. However, just as traditional broadcasters struggle, global streaming companies such as Netflix and Amazon continue to become an increasingly important income stream, the study showed. The latest bellwether census from industry body Pact said UK broadcasters such as ITV, the BBC, Channel 4 and Sky cut programming commissioning budgets due to factors such as a falling advertising market, viewers moving away from traditional TV and rising inflation. The freeze on the BBC\u2019s licence fee also led to severe spending cuts. The total amount spent on commissioning programmes by all UK-based broadcasters fell by more than 10% last year, from \u00a31.99bn to \u00a31.78bn, to the lowest level since the industry shut down during the pandemic in 2020. While spending by public service broadcasters \u2013 the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 \u2013 remained relatively resilient, budgets across multichannel broadcasters such as Sky plummeted by more than 35%. The report blamed this on part of the UK market being \u201cparticularly exposed to a difficult advertising market placing downward pressures on broadcaster margins\u201d. Bosses at Campbell Soup Company, whose cans feature in one of Andy Warhol\u2019s best-known 1960s pop artworks, have announced plans to drop \u201csoup\u201d from its name after more than 100 years. Its chief executive, Mark Clouse, said the decision to rename the group the Campbell\u2019s Company was part of a shift in focus to the other snack foods and jarred sauces it sold. The 155-year-old company started producing canned condensed soup in 1897 \u2013 believed to be the first in the US to do so \u2013 and has held the Campbell Soup Company name since 1922. Its place in US popular culture was further cemented when Warhol produced his screen prints depicting 32 cans of Campbell\u2019s soup with different flavours in the early 1960s. The PrettyLittleThing founder Umar Kamani said he was returning to the fast fashion brand, and one of his first changes will be to reintroduce free returns for its royalty customers. Retail Week described it as a \u201cshock return\u201d after he left the business last year. Britain\u2019s second-biggest drugmaker GSK has ditched its experimental vaccine for herpes after it failed in an early to intermediate stage trial \u2013 ending efforts to bring the first shot for the condition to market. The company said the trial for a therapeutic vaccine to treat the herpes simplex virus (HSV) did not meet its efficacy objective, and it won\u2019t be taken into late-stage trials. There were no safety issues. There are no approved vaccines for the virus, which causes genital herpes, although there is a shot for the herpes virus that causes chickenpox, made by the US drugs giant Merck. The Japanese virologist Michiaki Takahashi invented the first chickenpox vaccine. GSK said: Given the unmet medical need and burden associated with genital herpes, innovation in this area is still needed. GSK intends to evaluate the totality of all these data and other studies to progress future research and development of its HSV programme. GSK shares are down 0.8% on the news, but are still up by about 12% so far this year. Back to today\u2019s weaker-than-expected UK GDP figures. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, said: While the relative weakness of the economy in July comes as a surprise, we are not unduly concerned over the outlook for the remainder of the year, not least because survey evidence remains positive. In addition, the positive household income background remains a helpful, if perhaps surprising story \u2013 real household disposable incomes grew by 3.3% in the year to Q1 \u2013 providing ample ammunition for continued household consumption growth. It is also worth noting that recent UK economic history is due to be rewritten on 30 September with the publication of the \u2018Blue Book\u2019 which will include revisions to GDP since 2023. Changes to the economic profile for the prior period have already been published and these showed that GDP growth in 2022 was revised up to 4.8% from 4.3%. Realistically we cannot guess the scale or even the direction of the forthcoming revisions, but we will be able to make a more definitive judgment after the new figures are released (the monthly GDP series is due on 11 October). In the context of interest rates, today\u2019s figures do raise modestly the chances that the MPC will ease policy at the next meeting on Thursday week. However the committee is more likely to want to see updated GDP data before rushing to conclusions on the economy and our base case remains that the Bank rate will be held at 5.0%. Shares in WH Smith jumped by nearly 12% after it said the latest quarter had been strong, in particular its UK stores, and announced a \u00a350m share buyback. The 230-year-old chain, which sells books and magazines as well as food and drinks, has been closing highstreet stores and is pushing into travel hubs such as railway stations and airports. It said revenues rose by 7% in the year to 31 August, fuelled by 10% growth at its travel division. Carl Cowling, the chief executive, said: We have ended the financial year in a strong position, delivering a performance in line with our expectations with good growth across our travel businesses. Our UK division performed particularly well over the peak summer trading period. We are also today announcing the launch of a \u00a350m share buyback, which reflects strong ongoing cash flow, the receipt of the pension fund buyout cash return, as well as the strength of our balance sheet, with leverage now within our target range. UK and European stocks have made some modest gains. The FTSE 100 index in London has edged 0.1% higher to 8,212 while the German, French and Italian markets are between 0.3% and 0.4% ahead. In London, mining and commodities stocks are among the main risers, led by Antofagasta, Fresnillo and Glencore. Oil prices have risen by 1.3% amid concerns about Hurricane Francine disrupting output in the US. Brent crude is trading 91 cents higher at $70.10 a barrel, while US light crude has climbed to $66.66 a barrel. REA, the Australian property company majority-owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp, has made a \u00a35.6bn offer for Rightmove, the UK\u2019s biggest online real-estate portal. The Rightmove board rejected the 705p a share offer, worth 18.6% of the enlarged company post-deal, which comes a week after REA confirmed it was considering a cash and share offer for Rightmove. Shares in Rightmove closed at 555.6p on 30 August, the last trading day before news of REA\u2019s initial interest was revealed in the press, and closed at 670.8p at the end of trading on the London Stock Exchange yesterday. They rose by 1.2%, or 7.8p, to 678.6p in early trading today. REA said in a statement released on the Australian Stock Exchange today: REA confirms that on 5 September 2024 it made a non-binding indicative proposal to the board of directors of Rightmove regarding a possible cash and share offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Rightmove. REA was informed on 10 September 2024 that the Rightmove board rejected the proposal. Rightmove said: The board carefully considered the proposal, together with its financial advisers, and concluded that it was wholly opportunistic and fundamentally undervalued Rightmove and its future prospects. Accordingly, the board unanimously rejected the proposal \u2026 shareholders should take no action. Markets see a near-25% chance of an interest rate cut next week. Some economists (e.g. Capital Economics) say today\u2019s disappointing GDP data make a rate cut then a bit more likely, but overall economists still think November is more likely. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at RSM UK, said: The second consecutive month of no growth in July undershot expectations of 0.2% m/m and is clearly disappointing. But it won\u2019t be enough to convince the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to cut interest rates next month, especially as output in the services sector, where the MPC is watching price pressures like a hawk, rebounded. The next opportunity will come in November, when services inflation should have cooled enough to allow another cut. Turning to the budget on 30 October, he said: Disappointing growth will also add to the chancellor\u2019s misery ahead of a \u201cpainful\u201d budget next month. To really make a difference to the fiscal outlook though, she will have to convince the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that their supply side reforms to the planning system and boosting investment are going to kickstart growth. That looks unlikely without more radical reforms. The weakness in GDP was concentrated in the manufacturing sector, which fell by 1% m/m. Manufacturing is struggling globally, as surging exports from China, combined with weak global demand, especially for goods, weighs on production. Construction also dropped by 0.4% m/m as a wet July hampered construction efforts. Liz McKeown, ONS director of economic statistics, summed up the economic picture: July\u2019s monthly services growth was led by computer programmers and health, which recovered from strike action in June. These gains were partially offset by falls for advertising companies, architects and engineers. Manufacturing fell, overall, with a particularly poor month for car and machinery firms, while construction also declined. The 0.1% rise in service sector output in July was driven by retail sales rebounding and fewer strike days, although economists had expected a 0.2% rise. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, has crunched the numbers. Wholesale and retail output gained by 0.5%. Health and social work also rose by 0.5%, recovering half of the ground lost in June as junior doctors were on strike for two days in July compared to three in June. With no further doctors strikes planned, healthcare output is expected to jump again in August. Accommodation and food services did better than expected, rising by 0.9% month-to-month, stronger than the soft industry surveys had signalled. The downside surprise in services came in the powerhouse professional services sector, where output dropped by 1.3%. Wood said: That was a correction for unusually strong growth in the first half, when professional services output grew 4.4%. We expect this sector to return to growth in August. Isaac Stell, investment manager at the Wealth Club, said: A reversal in the fortunes for the manufacturing and construction sectors is a blow to the new Labour Government that has growth as a central pillar of its agenda. The usual bright spot was the bounce back in growth for the services sector with the health sector one of the leading contributors, springing back to life following strike action in June. A notable slowdown in advertising and architects may be indicative of a wider slowdown. With the canaries beginning to look a bit peaky, the chancellor may need to tread more carefully in October. A September interest rate cut is not certain despite the downbeat GDP data, said Suren Thiru, economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. He explained: These figures confirm that the UK economy struggled for momentum in the aftermath of the general election as falling manufacturing and construction output caused overall activity to flatline in July. The UK\u2019s growth trajectory should slow further in the coming months with higher energy bills and expected tax rises likely to trigger renewed restraint in spending and investment, despite a boost from subdued inflation. Despite these downbeat figures, a September rate cut is not certain given that some rate setters are still sufficiently nervous over lingering price pressures to delay loosening policy again, at least until November. \u201cThe July GDP print was disappointing: despite the modest boost from the Euros, the UK saw broad-based weakness across the economy,\u201d said Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank. Growth is normalising from the rapid pace set in the first half of 2024 \u2013 this much should be expected. The pace of the slowdown, however, is a little faster than we anticipated \u2013 especially in light of the still stellar survey data we\u2019ve seen over summer. The economy grew by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, followed by a 0.6% expansion in the second quarter but the latest ONS figures suggest the recovery from the mild recession in late 2023 has lost steam. Economists say this does not mean that the UK will slip back into recession. Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: The economy stagnated in July, but that doesn\u2019t mean the UK is on the cusp of another recession and we still think the stickiness of inflation will keep the Bank on hold in September. We still think a mild slowdown in GDP growth to more normal rates of 0.3% quarter-on-quarter later this year is more likely than a sudden drop back into recession. For now, we are sticking to our view that the Bank of England will keep interest rates unchanged in September before cutting rates again in November. But today\u2019s data has made an interest rate cut next Thursday a bit more likely. Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at abrdn, said: The economy performed a little softer than expected in July, with GDP flatlining. Industrial production and manufacturing were also weak, rounding off a set of weak UK data. As ever, though, monthly activity numbers are very volatile month to month, often reflecting more noise than signal. The broader trend remains solid, although it is likely that the underlying pace of growth will slow somewhat over the second half of the year. Certainly, there is no reason yet for the Bank and England to feel it needs to speed up the pace of rate cuts, and we expect the Bank to keep interest rates on hold next week. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: I am under no illusion about the scale of the challenge we face and I will be honest with the British people that change will not happen overnight. Two quarters of positive economic growth does not make up for fourteen years of stagnation. That is why we are taking the long-term decisions now to fix the foundations of our economy. Manufacturing was the main culprit behind the drop in industrial output (which also comprises mining and quarrying, and utilities) in July. Manufacturing output fell by 1% from June, and declined by 0.3% in the three months to July, compared with the previous three months. Our story is here: Bloomberg\u2019s political editor Alex Wickham said on X: Services activity picked up by 0.1% in July following a 0.1% dip in June, but did not show the expected strong pick-up while industrial production declined by 0.8%. Construction output was down by 0.4% in July. Services grew more strongly, by 0.6%, in the three months to July. There was also a 1.2% increase in construction output, while production dipped by 0.1% over this period. Professional, scientific and technical activities was the largest positive contributor to the rise in services output over the three month-period, up by 2%. The next largest contribution came from wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, where output increased by 0.7%. The UK economy continued to flatline in July, but grew by 0.5% in the three months to July, according to the latest official figures. Economists had expected GDP to rise by 0.2% in July. In June, there was also zero growth. The dollar fell by more than 1% against the yen to its weakest level of the year, after Kamala Harris put Donald Trump on the defensive in the first and only television debate in the presidential race last night. The yen also got a boost from Bank of Japan board member Junko Nakagawa, who reiterated in a speech that the central bank would continue to raise interest rates if inflation and the wider economy moved in line with its forecasts. The dollar dropped as much as 1.2% to 140.71 yen, a level not seen since 28 December before recovering slightly. Economists at Daiwa Capital Markets said: After economic output moved sideways in June, we expect a return to expansion in July with growth of 0.3% month on month, which would leave the three-month growth rate unchanged at a solid 0.6%. Growth will in part reflect the pickup in retail sales of 0.5% that month, when a long-awaited improvement in the weather boosted demand. Surveys also pointed to growth across the services sector as well as construction, while the manufacturing output PMI rose to the highest level in more than two years. So, although factory production grew in June by the most in four months, we expect the expansion in GDP in July to be broad-based. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The UK economy is expected to have returned to growth in July, after flatlining in June. The latest GDP figures from the Office for National Statistics, out at 7am, are expected to show that the economy expanded by 0.2% in July, after zero growth in June. Deutsche Bank economist Sanjay Raja, who is predicting a 0.3% rise in GDP in July, said: What\u2019s driving the increase in output? Mainly, a stronger rebound in services activity, led by a pick up in retail and leisure services. Industrial production output also likely expanded to start the third quarter, lifted in large part by an increase in oil production, and to a slightly lesser extent, manufacturing output. Last but not least, we expect the construction sector to see its third monthly consecutive rise (0.2% month on month). Where are risks to our nowcast skewed? To the downside, with our modelled estimates having a downward skew relative to our point estimate. Looking ahead, we continue to see GDP expanding at a steady clip, averaging roughly 0.4% quarter on quarter in the second half. It\u2019s early days, but risks to our quarterly nowcasts are skewed to the upside, raising upside risks to our annual growth projection too. We are also getting figures for trade and industrial production at the same time. It\u2019s also US inflation day. The annual headline rate is expected to have fallen to 2.6% from 2.9%, while the core rate, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, is set to have stayed at 3.2%. Investec economist Ryan Djajasaputra said: July\u2019s outturn provided further reassurance that inflation remains on a disinflationary path, with the 2.9% print being the first below 3% since March 2021. Early consensus estimates are for a further moderation to 2.6%. Also today: The British steel industry is braced for 2,500 job cuts at the Port Talbot steelworks, with thousands more jobs at risk in the UK, as the government prepares a taxpayer-backed deal for the south Wales plant. The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, is expected to outline this morning the details of a rescue deal which will see the government hand the historic Welsh plant\u2019s owners, Tata Steel, \u00a3500m to build a new electric furnace \u2013 but at the cost of huge redundancies from the closure of its last remaining blast furnace. Natarajan Chandrasekaran, the chair of Tata Group, told the Financial Times on Tuesday that talks were \u201cgoing well\u201d and it was \u201cvery close\u201d to agreeing a deal. It is understood the government, which previously promised to \u201cpush for job guarantees\u201d, has been unable to protect these jobs, with 2,500 still expected to go in the coming months. The Agenda 7am BST: UK GDP for July (forecast: 0.2%, previous: 0%) 7am BST: UK trade, industrial production for July 1.30pm BST: US inflation for August (forecast: 2.6%, previous: 2.9%)"

            "content": "Prices in UK shops are falling at the fastest rate since 2021 despite an increase in fresh food inflation as wet weather hit UK production while the cost of olive oil and sugary snacks continues to be affected by the climate crisis. Overall shop price deflation was 0.6% in September compared with 0.3% in August, according to the latest figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) trade body. However, that was led by reductions on non-food items \u2013 especially clothing and furniture \u2013 amid low demand because of unseasonal weather and a squeeze on household budgets from high bills on essentials including energy and groceries. Fresh food inflation increased to 1.5% from 1% in August as the wet weather affected British production of salads and soft fruit while storms in the Atlantic delayed imports of more exotic fruits, driving up prices. Hefty price rises for olive oil, which is counted as fresh produce in the BRC survey, underpinned the rise. Olive oil is now more than \u00a39.12 a litre on average \u2013 up 42% year on year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics \u2013 amid a drop in global production to the lowest level in more than a decade. Greece, Morocco and Turkey have produced less as part of the natural cycle of olive growth, while in Spain and Italy, trees are suffering from extreme heat and drought and attacks by pathogens as the climate crisis wreaks havoc on harvests. Packaged food price rises remained high at 3.3% in the year to September amid hefty price rises in cocoa and sugar. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said: \u201cSeptember was a good month for bargain hunters as big discounts and fierce competition pushed shop prices further into deflation. \u201cShop price inflation is now at its lowest level in over three years, with monthly prices dropping in seven of the last nine months. This was driven by non-food, with furniture and clothing showing the biggest drops in inflation as retailers tried to entice shoppers back. \u201cEasing price inflation will certainly be welcomed by consumers, but ongoing geopolitical tensions, climate change, and government-imposed regulatory costs could all reverse this trend.\u201d She called on the government to take \u201cdecisive action\u201d on business rates \u2013 a big cost for retailers with physical shops \u2013 in the budget on 30 October, saying the industry \u201cfaces a disproportionate tax burden\u201d compared with other industries."

            "date": "2024-09-23T14:40:08Z",
            "content": "Time for a recap: Uncertainty before Labour\u2019s first budget next month is weighing on the UK economy, according to two separate business surveys. The data company S&amp;P Global said UK private sector activity growth slowed for the second consecutive month in September, affecting companies in the services and manufacturing industries. Some companies reported that clients were taking a \u201cwait-and-see approach\u201d to decision-making before the autumn budget, which is hitting investment plans, even as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, wants to encourage business investment to boost economic growth. The figures suggest Labour\u2019s emphasis on its poor inheritance from the previous Conservative administration and the need for a tough budget on 30 October were weighing on the immediate outlook for many businesses. The S&amp;P survey found the budget was \u201cby far the most cited concern among UK private sector firms\u201d. Export orders remained \u201crelatively subdued\u201d and total overseas sales rose only \u201cmarginally\u201d in September. The survey said: \u201cSome service providers noted higher demand from US clients, but manufacturers frequently suggested that weak EU sales had weighed on export orders.\u201d A separate survey of manufacturers by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) found that export order books in the three months to September were at their weakest since December 2020 \u2013 during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, and just before the UK signed the Brexit trade agreement. More here: In other news\u2026 The economic picture in Germany is weakening too, with the economy being dragged into a contraction by its shrinking manufacturing sector. Billionaire Rupert Murdoch\u2019s REA Group has added another \u00a3200m to a sweetened offer for Rightmove, valuing the UK\u2019s biggest online property portal at more than \u00a36bn. REA lifted its offer after its first two approaches were rejected by Rightmove earlier this month. JCB has reported an increase in profits last year as strong US sales made up for its exports to Russia ending and faltering demand in the UK and Germany. Britain\u2019s biggest building society, Nationwide, is to let first-time buyers borrow up to six times their earnings in what has been labelled a \u201cgamechanging\u201d move that ramps up the mortgage price war. The price of petrol and diesel in the UK is falling at the fastest pace this year, with households paying about \u00a34 less to fill up a family car than they did a month ago. Fifty pubs a month closed for good across England and Wales in the first half of this year, with experts warning that tax rises in 2025 could make it even harder for some businesses to keep their doors open. Research has shown that house prices were not hit by the construction of a 137-mile electricity superhighway in Scotland. Back at the Labour party conference, a union boss has said Amazon should be at risk of losing taxpayer-funded contracts if it fails to \u201ctreat workers with respect\u201d. GMB general secretary Gary Smith accused the online giant of using \u201cdespicable\u201d tactics to stop workers at its Coventry site of unionising and questioned how it could be right for the company to receive more than \u00a31 billion in public contracts in the last year. In July, the GMB announced that Amazon workers in Coventry had voted by 49.5% in favour of union recognition \u2013 falling just short of the required majority. Smith said the ambition for the new Labour Government has to be \u201chigher than just cleaning up the Tory mess\u201d, adding its \u201chuge procurement powers will be critical\u201d. \u201cGMB members have been fighting to get union recognition at Amazon in Coventry. US business activity growth remained robust in September, the latest flash survey of purchasing managers shows, but election anxiety led to a drop in hiring. Dat provider S&amp;P Global has just reported that the US services sector drove a \u201csustained robust economic upturn in September,\u201d more than making up for a decline in manufacturing. The flash US PMI Composite Output Index has slipped to 54.4, down from August\u2019s 54.6, but still a level that shows robust growth. However, business optimism waned as bosses watched to see whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris would win the race to the White House in November. The survey says: A moderation of order book growth and a deterioration in business expectations for the year ahead to a near two-year low meanwhile reflected heightened uncertainty ahead of the Presidential Election. Companies consequently held back on hiring and allowed employment to fall for a second successive month. The prices charged by US companies rose at the fastest rate for six months, pushed higher by input cost growth accelerating to a one-year high, the survey added. Tensions are rising in Europe\u2019s banking sector today, after Italy\u2019s Unicredit took steps to more than double its stake in Germany\u2019s Commerzbank to over 20%. UniCredit defied Germany\u2019s defence of Commerzbank by using derivative contracts on Monday to raise its potential stake in the German bank close to 21%, while waiting for regulatory approval to lift its stake above 9.9%. Earlier this month Unicredit surprised Commerzbank by revealing it had a 9% stake \u2013 half of which was acquired from the German government. This has sparked speculation that Europe could see a cross-border banking merger. Today, the Italian bank explained: \u201cUniCredit believes that there is substantial value that can be unlocked within Commerzbank, either stand-alone or within UniCredit, for the benefit of Germany and the bank\u2019s wider stakeholders. However, as was the case for UniCredit, such potential requires action for it to be crystalized.\u201d Unicredit\u2019s move has ruffled feathers in Germany. Today, Commerzbank board member Stefan Wittmann condemned the stake-building as a \u201ccompletely inappropriate aggressive act\u201d. But in Rome, Italian foreign minister Antonio Tajani declared today \u201cit was more than legitimate\u201d for an Italian company to try to buy part of a German competitor. Tajani said: \u201cThis is the internal market, being pro-European only in words leaves something to be desired, UniCredit is a big Italian bank and it is doing well to act within the internal market.\u201d One hundred and 50 UK MPs have written to supermarket chain Asda, urging it to end pay discrimination across its business. The MPs say it is unfair that mainly female shop workers\u2019 roles are paid up to \u00a33.74 per hour less than predominantly male warehouse workers. This issue is currently being examained by a employment tribunal, which began earlier this month. Asda is fighting the case, arguing that retail and distribution are two different industry sectors that have their own distinct skill sets and pay structures.\u201d The letter says: We, the undersigned MPs, call on you to take action against pay discrimination in ASDA stores. GMB union have told us that they have estimated women workers on the shop floor earn up to \u00a33.74 per hour less than their male counterparts in warehouses. ASDA\u2019s retail workers are currently owed over \u00a32 billion in back pay. Over 60,000 current and former ASDA retail workers have lodged claims and with the equal value hearing underway, now is the time for ASDA to begin seriously considering how to address the issue of pay discrimination. We believe it is simply unfair for people to be paid differently for doing work of the same value. Everyone deserves equal pay for equal work. As MPs with ASDA stores and workers in our constituencies, we urge you to urgently commence settlement negotiations with the GMB union. Signaturies to the letter include senior Labour MPs such as Diane Abbott, Stella Creasy and Rebecca Long Bailey. It comes as Asda struggles with a falling market share, and rising debts, with veteran retailer Sir Stuart Rose stepping up to run the business. In June, more than 3,500 workers and former employees of Next have won a similar six-year equal pay claim. An employment tribunal ruled that Next failed to demonstrate that paying sales consultants (mostly women) \u2013 lower hourly pay rates than warehouse operatives (who tend to be men) was not sex discrimination. Goldman Sachs Group are predicting that the pound will continue to rally against the US dollar, and hit $1.40 within a year, Bloomberg reports. That would be a notable increase on its current level of $1.33, and the pound\u2019s highest level against the US dollar since summer 2021. The call is based on the Bank of England\u2019s reluctance to accelerate the pace of interest-rate cuts, even though central bankers in the US and eurozone are acting more aggressively to support their economies. Summer 2021 Post Office chief executive Nick Read wanted the two post office operators appointed to the company\u2019s board removed, and blocked them from meetings on issues including pay and bonuses, the inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal has heard. Saf Ismail was appointed to the Post Office board as a non-executive director in June 2021, along with fellow subpostmaster Elliott Jacobs, in a move to repair relations and improve oversight as part of an attempt to overhaul the organisation and \u201cright the wrongs of the past\u201d. Ismail gave scathing testimony to the inquiry saying that while the other non-executive directors on the board welcomed the new appointments, Post Office executive members did not. \u201cThe wider executive made it difficult [and there were] situations we didn\u2019t feel welcomed by the wider executive,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI was told by an individual on the wider executive that \u2018we don\u2019t want to particularly deal with you and Mr Jacobs as we feel uncomfortable with what has bee happening\u2019\u201d. Ismail said that Jane Davies, the former Post Office HR director that accused Read of bullying and an \u201cobsession\u201d with remuneration, told him that he [Read] wanted them off the board. He said: \u201cShe categorically told said to me how the chief executive was not happy with postmasters being on the board. We were too awkward, too challenging, and he wanted that to be reversed. There were times when I spoke to the previous [Post Office] chair [Henry Staunton] and Jane Davies and they particularly mentioned how the wider executive ensured myself and Mr Jacobs were blocked out of meetings that involved talking about bonuses and salaries. We were actively excluded from their meetings.\u201d An investigation by an independent barrister cleared Read on all counts of misconduct relating to Davies\u2019s accusations against him. Ismail said that despite the promises to overhaul the culture and processes at the Post Office it remains too bureaucratic, and is focused on protecting its own employees instead of exiting those involved in the wrongful prosecution of subpostmasters from the organisation. \u201cI heard Paula Vennells say [to the inquiry] that she started to try cultural change in 2012,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel we\u2019ve even got off the ground.\u201d He said that until recently the two subpostmaster board members were not provided documents relating to various committee meetings, and recounted an example of the hiring for a role internally where the Post Office executive ignored the recommendation of a candidate by the board, instead appointing their own choice. Ismail criticised two initiatives launched to root out staff involved in the Horizon IT scandal, Project Phoenix and Past Roles, saying that decision-making was \u201cinquiry-led\u201d with the semblance of action only being taken after events at the Post Office inquiry put a spotlight on individuals. Ismail said that while subpostmasters were immediately suspended and then pursued legally, Post Office staff involved remain employed, and are often redeployed with a new job title, instead. He said there are 23 employees on a \u201cred\u201d list, deemed high-risk given their involvement in the scandal in one way or other, none of whom who have even been suspended. \u201cTo be clear from my observations at the time there was no particular appetite to deal with this issue,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cDecisions were \u2018inquiry-led\u2019. The default position in the Post Office at this moment in time is protect. Unfortunately this business redeploys, recycles. I don\u2019t feel it is appropriate for individuals in the red category to be in the business. I feel it is an insult. This is not a witch hunt, this is parity.\u201d Britain\u2019s biggest building society is to let first-time buyers borrow up to six times their earnings in what has been labelled a \u201cgame-changing\u201d move that ramps up the mortgage price war. Weeks after it was announced that the Halifax and Lloyds would allow new buyers to take out loans worth up to 5.5 times their household annual income, Nationwide said it would now go up to six times income \u2013 a first for a major high street lender. Nationwide is also cutting its mortgage rates and increasing its maximum loan sizes, so that someone taking out a home loan for more than 90% of the property\u2019s value will now be able to borrow up to \u00a3750,000 \u2013 up from the existing \u00a3500,000, and higher than the \u00a3570,000 limit at many rivals. The moves come amid an ongoing mortgage price war that has seen lenders jostle to cut their rates in the wake of the Bank of England\u2019s 1 August interest rate cut and the expectation of more reductions to come. Disinflation and interest rate cuts will stimulate UK growth in the rest of this year, credit rating agency S&amp;P Global Ratings has forecast. In its latest report, S&amp;P predicts that consumers will spend more as price rises slow, while businesses will benefit from lower borrowing costs, encouraging investment. Looking ahead, S&amp;P predict: Supply shocks following the pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine are no longer fueling inflation. The opposite is now true, with shortages, energy, and food prices representing a drag on inflation compared to before the start of the pandemic. We expect this will be the case for much of the rest of the year. They add: The period of real wage catch-up as price inflation led to higher wages, and companies raising prices and increasing profit margins in response to higher input costs, is over. The model no longer underestimates wage and price dynamics as it did from second-quarter 2022 and throughout 2023. Profit margins are narrowing and companies have had to grapple with higher financing costs and weak demand growth. Consequently, they are less willing to increase their workforce or employee salaries. Newsflash: Swedish electric car battery maker Northvolt plans to lay off 1,600 employees in Sweden, including 1,000 positions at its factory in Skelleftea in the north of the country. Northvolt, which had been Europe\u2019s great hope for a electric battery manufacturer, says it is \u201cadjusting its near-term ambitions\u201d and focusing on deeloping its lithium-ion battery gigafactory at Ett, near the Arctic Circle. This, Northvolt says, will allow it to prioritize commitments to its current automotive customers. Northvolt is cutting 1,000 positions at Skellefte\u00e5, 400 at V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, and 200 in Stockholm. Peter Carlsson, CEO and co-founder of Northvolt, says: \u201cWhile overall momentum for electrification remains strong, we need to make sure that we take the right actions at the right time in response to headwinds in the automotive market, and wider industrial climate. We now need to focus all energy and investments into our core business. Success in the ramp-up of production at Northvolt Ett is critical for delivering to our customers and enabling sustainable business operations. Recent production records at Northvolt Ett show that we are on the right path, but the decisions we\u2019re taking today, however tough, are required for Northvolt\u2019s future.\u201d Post office owner-operators from a minority ethnic background are more likely to have been threatened with suspension than those from a white background, the inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal has heard. An anonymous survey published on the first day of the final phase of the long-running inquiry also received reports from eight subpostmasters who said that they had been suspended or threatened with suspension in the last three years after issues with discrepancies with the IT system had emerged. The survey, conducted by research firm YouGov, found that 8% of a total of more than 1,000 respondents said that they had been threatened with suspension by the Post Office in the past. However, it found that 12% of subpostmasters threatened with suspension were from an ethnic minority background, and 17% of those with an Asian/Asian British background. A further 4% said that they had been suspended and subsequently re-instated. \u201cSubpostmasters surveyed from ethnic minority back grounds were more likely than white subpostmasters to have been suspended and re-instated - 6% versus 2%,\u201d said the YouGov report. \u201cAs were those who have been serving subpostmasters for 21 years or more.\u201d Gavin Ellison, the head of public sector and not-for-profit at YouGov, told the hearing that the findings were statistically significant. Last year, documents released to campaigners revealed that lawyers investigating post office operators in the Horizon computer scandal used a racist term to categorise Black workers. Investigators were asked to group suspects based on racial features, a freedom of information request found. The document, which was published between 2008 and 2011, included the term \u201cnegroid types\u201d, along with \u201cChinese/Japanese types\u201d and \u201cdark skinned European types\u201d. Ellison was asked whether there was a link between suspensions and subpostmasters finding discrepancies in their accounts using the Horizon IT system. However, while he said that while there was \u201cno causation between those two factors\u201d the survey did find respondents who said that this was the case. YouGov published an addendum document relating to the issue which contained some anonymous written statements about the issue in the past three years. One respondent said: \u201cThere were shortfalls when we first took over the post office. We had complained but we were told that the computer doesn\u2019t make mistakes. An audit [was] done a few months later and we were accused of theft and threatened to be suspended if we didn\u2019t pay back the money. We [were] already told their system had flaws.. but they still accused us. Degrading us. Calling us thieves. Majority post office auditors made postmasters feel like thieves.\u201d YouGov qualified the experiences of these subpostmasters, pointing out that 69% of the overall respondents to its survey had reported having experienced discrepancies with the Horizon IT system since January 2020. \u201cA total of eight SPMs surveyed reported being suspended or threatened with suspension in the past 3 years and all stated that they experienced an unexplained discrepancy since 2020,\u201d the research company said in the three-page document. \u201cWe can only identify correlation not causation.\u201d The YouGov report showed that the 89% of the discrepancies reported by respondents was less than \u00a31,000, although 1% reported a discrepancy of \u00a330,000 or more. Shares in UK semiconductor group Alphawave have dropped by a quarter this morning, after the company cut its guidance for full-year revenue and earnings this morning. Alphawave make customised silicon chips and also silicon \u2018building blocks\u2019 that are integrated into chip designs. It reported a 51% drop in revenues, year-on-year, in the first half 0f 2024, resulting in a pre-tax loss of almost \u00a350m, down from a \u00a36m loss a year earlier. Alphawave lowered its guidance due to \u201ca merger of two large AI customers in Korea\u201d, which led to development programmes being consolidated. Tony Pialis, president and chief executive officer of Alphawave Semi says the company plans to help drive the next generation of artificial intelligence systems: \u201cWe are successfully executing on our strategy, with a significantly expanded range of advanced connectivity solutions, including chiplets, that will enable the next generation of AI and cloud infrastructure. In the first half of the year, we have continued investing organically to support our pipeline and future revenue growth. Our leading connectivity technology and strong execution give us confidence in the prospects for our business in the second half of 2024 and beyond.\u201d Newsflash: UK factories have been hit by a slump in export orders this month. The CBI reports that export order books are now their weakest since December 2020 \u2013 during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, and just before the UK signed the Brexit trade agreement. Its latest industrial trands report has found that total and export order books at manufacturers deteriorated in September. A net balance of 44% of manufacturers reported that their export order books were below \u201cnormal\u201d this month. That\u2019s a considerable deterioration compared to August, where the reading was -22%. Worryingly, output volumes fell sharply in the three months to September \u2013 and manufacturers expect output to decline again in the three months to December. This is the first time since November 2023 that expectations have been negative. Ben Jones, CBI lead economist, said: \u201cThis was a uniformly disappointing set of results for the manufacturing sector, with output falling over the past quarter, order books deteriorating and manufacturers expecting activity to soften further in the remaining months of the year.\u201d \u201cThe survey highlights that the recovery of the UK economy seen over the first half of 2024 remains fragile, with uneven progress seen across different sectors, and businesses increasingly cautious ahead of the Budget at the end of next month.\u201d \u201cIn the meantime, firms will be looking to the Chancellor to reaffirm the government\u2019s mission of long-term economic growth, providing them with the confidence and opportunities to invest and grow.\u201d The UK PMI report is the latest sign that uncertainty around October Budget is a concern for businesses, says Daniel Mahoney, UK economist at Handelsbanken: Mahoney also points to last Friday\u2019s data showing consumer confidence in the UK has fallen sharply. He says today: While the [PMI] release is showing a broadly positive picture for the UK\u2019s economic prospects, concerns about the upcoming Budget feature prominently in the survey. We saw last Friday that consumer confidence has taken a knock due to worries about upcoming tax measures and businesses appear to be concerned on this front, too. In both the manufacturing and service sectors there were some reports of clients adopting a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach to decision making ahead of the Autumn Budget. Moreover, the most cited concern among UK private sector firms was fiscal policy uncertainty ahead of the October Budget. We continue to hope that the hit to consumer and, to a lesser extent, business confidence is short-lived given the fundamentals of the UK economy do not warrant this kind of pessimism. The news that Rachel Reeves is ordering investigations into more than \u00a3600m worth of Covid contracts awarded under the Conservatives has been welcomed by anti-corruption campaigners. The Guardian reported this morning that the chancellor will announce today that she will refer more than half of contracts for material such as masks to the incoming Covid corruption commissioner. Daniel Bruce, chief executive of Transparency International UK says this is an \u201cimportant first step\u201d towards accountability over governent spending during the pandemic. Bruce hopes that some of the money spent on pandemic equipment can be recovered, saying: \u201cWe have repeatedly warned of the scale of corruption risk in the former government\u2019s approach to procurement during the pandemic and have identified over \u00a315 billion of high-risk contracts in need of investigation. Today\u2019s announcement is an important first step towards full accountability for the serious procurement failings we saw during the pandemic and we urge the Chancellor to launch similar investigations into the 135 contracts we\u2019ve identified. Such investigations offer an important chance for the new government to recoup some of the millions of pounds of public money wasted on these contracts and implement lessons learned to ensure this never happens again. This month\u2019s slowdown in company prices rises, according to the PMI report, may make it easier for the Bank of England to lower interest rates soon. S&amp;P\u2019s Chris Williamson explains: In the meantime, services inflation, stubbornly elevated rates of which have been the bugbear of the Bank of England, cooled in September to the lowest since February 2021 to help bring the Bank of England\u2019s 2% inflation target closer into view. The survey data therefore support the view that there is scope for interest rates to fall further in the closing months of 2024.\u201d Capital Economics predict the Bank will cut rates once more this year in November, before the pace of cuts quickens next year with rates eventually settling at 3.00%. This morning\u2019s \u201cugly\u201d eurozone PMI numbers contrast again with a more resilient UK economy, says Kyle Chapman, FX markets analyst at broker Ballinger Group. The UK maintained its growth advantage versus the eurozone in September, according to the PMIs. While the eurozone economy slipped into contraction for the first time since February at 48.9, the British surveys signalled cooler but steady growth at 52.9. The eurozone numbers are not pretty, and they are providing some validation to those at the ECB calling for a quicker pace of rate cuts to ease the deceleration in activity. The economic rebound we saw in the first half of the year has completely fizzled out, and the return to contraction attests to the fact that ECB policy is probably more restrictive than necessary. Pricing for an October rate cut is ticking higher, and without a stabilisation in the growth outlook, there will be convergence to the more dovish rate path for the Fed - especially given growing signs of layoffs in the manufacturing sector. That\u2019s not a good picture for the euro. Meanwhile, the UK economy remains relatively resilient, and the gap has widened even further versus the eurozone. Everything about the report says soft landing for the UK \u2013 growth is cooling but remains robust, and inflationary pressures are evidently easing. There are plenty of softer price indicators in the report for the Bank of England to take comfort from, with employment growth slowing and growth in end prices falling to a more than three-year low. The pound has hit a two-year high against the euro, after this morning\u2019s PMI surveys showed the UK economy outperforming the eurozone this month. Sterling has gained half a eurocent to \u20ac1.1967 this morning, its highest level since early August 2022. Although UK company growth is slowing this month, the economy doesn\u2019t seem to be sliding into a downturn, reports Alex Kerr, UK economist at Capital Economics. Kerr says that September\u2019s PMI report is consistent with GDP growth slowing from 0.6% q/q in the second quarter of this year to a more normal rate of around 0.3% q/q in the third quarter. Kerr told clients: The fall in September\u2019s composite flash PMI is not a sign that the economy is on the cusp of another downturn, but instead is further evidence that real GDP growth has slowed towards a more normal rate in Q3 after the burst of growth in the first half of the year. Uncertainty ahead of next month\u2019s budget is weighing on the UK economy, the latest survey of purchasing managers across British companies shows. Data firm S&amp;P Global reports that UK private sector activity growth has slowed this month, across both services firms and manufacturers. Some companies reported that clients are taking a \u201cwait-and-see approach\u201d to decision-making ahead of the Autumn Budget, which is hitting investment. Fiscal policy uncertainty ahead of the budget, due on 30 October, was \u201cby far the most cited concern among UK private sector firms\u201d, the PMI survey shows. Private sector employment growth slowed for the second month running to its weakest since June. But encouragingly, firms slowed their price rises this month \u2013 with the average prices charged by private sector firms rising at the slowest rate since February 2021. Overall, the Flash UK PMI Composite Output Index dipped to 52.9, down from August\u2019s 53.8. That\u2019s a two-month low, but still in growth territory, and much cheerier than in Germany or the wider eurozone this month (see earlier posts). Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence says: \u201cThe September PMI data bring encouraging news, with robust economic growth being accompanied by a cooling of inflationary pressures. The data therefore hint at a \u2018soft landing\u2019 for the UK economy, whereby the fight against inflation is showing increasing signs of being won without higher interest rates having caused a downturn. Williamson adds, though, that concerns about the budget are \u201cjangling nerves somewhat\u201d, explaining: Investment plans in particular are reported to have been put on ice pending clarity on the new government\u2019s policies, especially towards taxation. Hiring likewise has been stifled by business uncertainty about the near-term economic outlook ahead of the \u2018budget\u2019. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged this morning that there will not \u201cbe a return to austerity\u201d. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning, Reeves said: \u201cThere won\u2019t be a return to austerity, there will be real terms increases to government spending in this Parliament. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is there will not be real terms cuts to government spending, but the detailed department by department spending will be negotiated.\u201d The downturn in Germany has pulled the wider eurozone economy into a contraction this month. Business activity across the euroarea has decreased so far in September, according to the HCOB Flash Eurozone PMI index. It has dropped to 48.9 this month, an eight month low, and below the 50-point mark showing stagnation. As well as Germany\u2019s slump, the eurozone was also pulled down by a contraction in France\u2019s private sector, as an Olympics-related boost to business activity in August faded. Business confidence continued to wane, as firms reported a drop in new orders. The recovery in the UK housing market, and the prospect of more cuts to UK interest rates, makes Rightmove an attractive target for Australia\u2019s REA Group, says Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown: Streeter explains: Rightmove shares had been affected by the property market downturn amid a ratcheting up in interest rates. But now, with more cuts eyed on the horizon and a recovery in prices underway, there are now many more eyes on screen. REA Group is clearly highly tempted by the sturdy fundamentals of the model, which offers an envious operating margin position of around 70%. DIY alternatives may be growing, but they are only a small slice of the market, and many estate agents can\u2019t afford not to advertise on Rightmove. That\u2019s demonstrated by their willingness to pay bigger sums to attract potential buyers. Although total membership has reduced by 1% in the last full year, average revenue per advertiser was up 9% to \u00a31,431. Newsflash: the German economy is sinking deeper into contraction, dragged down by its manufacturing sector. Thw latest HCOB \u2018flash\u2019 PMI survey compiled by S&amp;P Global, just released, shows that business activity across Germany is falling at the quickest rate for seven months in September. German businesses reported increased caution among customers, deterring them from making investments; concerns towards the health of the economy were reported to be a factor. Total inflows of new business fell at the quickest rate for nearly a year in September, and firms cut jobs for the fourth month running. This pulled Germany\u2019s flash composite PMI output index down for the fourth month in a row, to 47.2, down from August\u2019s 48.4. That\u2019s the lowest reading since February \u2013 anything below 50 shows a contraction. Manufacturing shrank at the fastest pace in a year, while the modest growth in the services sector was the weakest in six months. Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, fears that a technical recession (two quarters of negative growth in a row) in Germany is now \u201cbaked in\u201d. De la Rubia says: \u201cThe downturn in the manufacturing sector has deepened again, evaporating any hope for an early recovery. Output plunged at the fastest rate in a year, with new orders collapsing. In a sign of resignation, companies have shed staff at a rate not seen since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This comes as several major automotive suppliers have announced significant job reductions. These troubling figures are likely to intensify the ongoing debate in Germany about the risk of deindustrialization and what the government should do about it. Optimism is something of the past. Manufacturers are downright depressed about their future activity, with expectations for the coming year plummeting. In a striking shift, moderate optimism in August has quickly turned into the steepest pessimism in a year by September. This rapid downturn in sentiment is most likely linked to the wave of negative headlines surrounding Volkswagen, which has cast a shadow over the broader industry. Hamburg Commercial Bank predicts Germany\u2019s economy will shrink by 0.2% in the July-September quarter. That would put the country into recession, as GDP fell by 0.1% in April-June. Newsflash: Rightmove has said it will \u201ccarefully consider\u201d the new, inproved, takeover offer from REA Group, and respond \u201cin due course\u201d. In a statement to the City, Rightmove confirms it has received a third proposal from REA, which it dubs \u201cunsolicited, non-binding and highly conditional\u201d. Rightmove says its. board will \u201ccarefully consider the Increased Proposal, together with its financial advisers.\u201d Rightmove shareholders should take no action in respect of the Increased Proposal, it says. Andrew Fisher, chair of Rightmove, reiterates that REA\u2019s first two bids were both rejected for being \u201cuncertain, highly opportunistic and unattractive\u201d. Fisher says: \u201cRightmove is an exceptional company with a very clear strategy, a consistent track record of delivery and a strong management team. The Board is confident in the Company\u2019s short and long term prospects, and sees a long runway for continued shareholder value creation. \u201cBased on the implied value and structure of REA\u2019s first and second indicative non-binding proposals, we considered these proposals to be uncertain, highly opportunistic and unattractive. Accordingly, the Board unanimously rejected them. \u201cThe Board will continue to act on behalf of our shareholders and respond to the most recent proposal in due course.\u201d Rightmove also points out that the 2% drop in REA\u2019s shares today has pulled down the value of its cash and share offer, from 770p to 761p [making the offer worth around \u00a36bn]. Rightmove has jumped to the top of the risers on the FTSE 100 share index at the start of trading, after Rea Group upped its takeover offer again. Rightmove are up 3.8% at 700p. That\u2019s still some way shy of Rea\u2019s new offer, which values Rightmove at 770p per share. There\u2019s drama in the government bond markets this morning, where Sri Lanka\u2019s debt is sliding after left-wing candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake won the country\u2019s presidential election. Dissanayake, seen as marxist-leaning, has capitalised on the anger and frustration that had emerged following Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis. Having won the vote, he has pledged to preserve democracy and clean up public life, promising that a \u201cnew renaissance will rise from this shared strength and vision\u201d. But Sri Lanka\u2019s bonds have been hit, on fears that the nation\u2019s bailout by the International Monetary Fund and debt deals could be threatened. Bonds fell around three percentage points, with a security that matures in 2025 losing 3.3 cents to 49.28 cents. Spending on health and beauty products is booming despite cost-of-living pressures, a new survey shows. The latest Barclays Consumer Spend data shows health and beauty has been the highest-performing category in retail since August 2023. Last month, consumer spending on health and beauty rose 7.3% year-on-year, while overall retail spending was up 0.1%. Nearly half of consumers see such spending as \u201cessential\u201d \u2013 a category which typically includes priority purchases such as groceries and childcare, Barclays says. Karen Johnson, head of retail at Barclays, says: \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see that overall beauty spending has been in growth year-on-year, with August showing the highest level of growth in the past 18 months. Our data shows that social media has proven to play a key role in influencing online purchases, a further demonstration of the rising commercial importance of these platforms. \u201cThe health and beauty sector exemplifies continuous growth, likely driven by social media, particularly among younger generations. The key to a resilient retail model is examining these trends to better understand future purchasing behaviours.\u201d Elsewhere this morning, smart sensing software company Oxford Metrics has told the City that customers are being more cautious. Oxford Metrics told shareholders that it now expects adjusted pre-tax profts to be materially below current market expectations for the financial year. It explained: While the Group continues to have a healthy pipeline, the trend of more extended buying cycles has developed in the second half against a strong prior year comparative. Globally, we are seeing customers across our markets exercising greater caution and purchasing decisions are taking longer to conclude. A number of opportunities in the pipeline have now shifted into the new financial year. Shares in REA Group have dropped by 2.1% today on the Australian stock market, after it upped its offer for Rightmove again. Having lifted their takeover offer again, Rea also disputes Rightmove\u2019s claim that its approach is \u201cwholly opportunistic\u201d. They told investors today: Rightmove\u2019s share price has lacked any sustained upward momentum for two years, with a last 24 months VWAP [volume-weighted average price]] of 540 pence, a last 12 months VWAP of 540 pence and an undisturbed share price on 30 August 2024 of 556 pence, despite being supported by its ongoing share buyback programme and revised strategy announced at last year\u2019s Capital Markets Day. This chart shows Rightmove\u2019s shares jumped at the start of this month, when REA\u2019s original approach was announced: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. When bidding for property, it\u2019s important not to take no for an answer. Australia\u2019s REA Group is taking this advice seriously, and has just launched its third offer to buy UK housing portal Rightmove. After being rebuffed twice this month, REA has upped its offer again. It is now proposing to pay around \u00a36.1bn for the UK\u2019s biggest online property portal. REA\u2019s offer is worth 770p per Rightmove share \u2013 structured as 341p in cash and 0.0422 new REA shares In a statement to the Australia stock market this morning, Owen Wilson, CEO of REA, insisted the deal made sense, saying: \u201cWe believe that the combination of our world-leading expertise and technology with the attractive Rightmove business will create an enhanced experience for agents, buyers and sellers of property. We live in a world of intensifying competition and this proposed transaction would bring together two highly complementary digital property businesses for investment and growth. Wilson added that REA is \u201cgenuinely disappointed at the lack of engagement by Rightmove\u2019s Board\u201d. REA, which is majority owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp, made its first approach to Rightmove on 5 September, when it proposed paying 705p per share, or \u00a35.6bn. That was rebuffed, with Rightmove\u2019s board saying it \u201cfundamentally\u201d undervalued the company. Then on Friday night, news broke that REA had increased its offer by \u00a3300m. Rightmove weren\u2019t commenting officially on that offer yesterday, but Bloomberg reported that \u201cpeople familiar with the matter\u2019\u201d said it had been rejected. Now, Rightmove\u2019s board must ponder this third offer. The company\u2019s shares closed at 674p on Friday night (before news of the second offer broke), which values Rightmove at \u00a35.32bn. Also coming up today Surveys of purchasing managers across the UK, Eurozone and the US will show how major economies are faring this month. And in Liverpool, chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to promise \u201ca Budget to rebuild Britain\u201d in her speech to the Labour Party conference today.

            "title": "Mario Draghi warns EU at risk without \u20ac800bn a year investment boost; Germany \u2018facing three-quarters-long recession\u2019\u2013 as it happened",
            "date": "2024-09-09T15:00:14Z",
            "content": "PS: Investment bank ABN Amro have just published their \u201cinitial take\u201d on Draghi\u2019s competitiveness report. They point out that the \u201cambitious proposals\u201d are effectively a plan for the future of EU integration. The call for common eurozone debt will be a political hot potato too, while Draghi\u2019s points about mis-aligned government policies are well made. Here\u2019s what ABN Amro say: Ambitious proposals are no less than a blueprint for the future of EU integration Former ECB president and Italian prime minister Mario Draghi\u2019s long-awaited report on competitiveness was finally unveiled this morning, and it was unexpectedly substantial and concrete in its proposals. The report tackles a host of critical competitiveness issues facing Europe, from energy and decarbonisation, to lowering regulatory and other barriers for high-innovating tech unicorns (which typically move to the US to achieve sufficient scale), to strengthening industrial capacity (which also has implications for defence \u2013 a topic of increasing geopolitical importance). Its flagship proposal is for \u20ac800bn in additional EU investment annually, to be partly funded by the common issuance of new common debt. Crucially, the case for common debt issuance rests not only on financing need, but also to \u201cmake the [Capital Markets Union] much easier to achieve and more complete,\u201d by: 1) facilitating the uniform pricing of corporate bonds, 2) providing a safe collateral instrument for member states, 3) a \u201clarge, liquid market\u201d for global investors \u201cenhancing the role of the euro as a reserve currency.\u201d The proposals face an uphill political struggle, to put it mildly In the press conference accompanying the report, European Commission president Von der Leyen was immediately asked for her views on the call for new common debt issuance. Her response was understandably neutral, given the political sensitivity of the topic. She stated that the first priority was to identify the \u2018common projects\u2019 where member states could cooperate, and then decide whether these should be financed through higher contributions or through \u2018new own resources\u2019. When Draghi himself was pressed on this topic, he pointed to the possibility of using the EU\u2019s enhanced cooperation mechanism \u2013 or even a separate intergovernmental agreement outside the EU structures \u2013 to allow a \u2018coalition of the willing\u2019 to forge ahead on debt issuance if unanimity could not be achieved on the issue. Given the political momentum of populist, anti-EU parties at present (see also here), the environment is hardly conducive to the proposals being adopted as they are. A memorable moment in the press conference came when a journalist asked if the report represented a \u2018do or die\u2019 moment for the EU; Draghi responded it was rather a \u2018do, or slow agony\u2019. Typically, crises are needed to push EU integration forward, and it could be that the \u2018slow agony\u2019 of the EU\u2019s competitiveness problem will not be enough to galvanise the political will to overcome it. But there is much more to the report than common debt While this was the most headline-grabbing proposal, the report made many pertinent observations with less controversial, actionable measures. For instance, in the press conference Draghi pointed out that the mandate to phase out internal combustion engine cars was not accompanied by investment in energy infrastructure to support the roll-out of EVs. Or the fact that energy taxation in Europe is relatively high as well as uneven across member states, aggravating the impact of the rise in wholesale energy prices. Policy goals are often misaligned and even compete with one another, with decarbonisation an impediment to growth rather than the growth impulse that it could be. Time for a recap: The EU should fear for its self-preservation as it faces a \u201cslow and agonising decline\u201d, according to a hard-hitting report by the former Italian prime minister Mario Draghi that calls for an \u20ac800bn-a-year spending boost to end years of stagnation. Warning that the Covid pandemic and Ukraine war had changed the rules of international trade to the EU\u2019s detriment, he said the bloc needed additional investment of \u20ac750bn-\u20ac800bn a year \u2013 equivalent to 5% of the EU\u2019s annual economic output \u2013 to build a more resilient economy and regain previously high rates of productivity growth. \u201cWe are already in crisis mode and to ignore this is to slide into a situation you don\u2019t want to have,\u201d said Draghi, who is also a former head of the European Central Bank. In a wide-ranging report, Draghi said Europe should start regularly issuing \u201ccommon safe assets\u201d to fund joint investment projects among Member States, co-ordinate better on defence spending, and improve its access to raw materials. And in a stark warning, he said: \u201cWe have to understand we are becoming ever smaller relative to the challenges we face. For the first time since the cold war we must genuinely fear for our self-preservation.\u201d German economy minister Robert Habeck welcomed the proposal, saying: \u201cThe whole of Europe is facing existential challenges that we can only overcome together.\u201d But, the Dutch government cautioned that public investments must not be seen as an \u201cend in themselves.\u201d In a gloomy day for European economic news: Swedish manufacturer Northvolt is to cut a large number of jobs and sell or seek partners for its energy storage and materials businesses. Germany has entered a three-quarter-long recession, according to investment bank Nomura Elsewhere today\u2026. In the financial markets, shares have rallied in New York and across Europe, following losses on Friday when the latest US jobs report came in below forecasts. The UK is missing out on billions of pounds of revenue each year from small retail businesses that exploit weaknesses in government systems to evade paying tax, the public spending watchdog has warned. Aldi has said the price of a basket of its goods is lower than a year ago despite ongoing grocery inflation, as the discount chain tries to fight back against increasing pressure from rivals\u2019 price-matching schemes. Barratt and Lloyds Banking Group have launched a \u00a3150m joint venture with the government body Homes England that will lead to the UK\u2019s largest housebuilder and mortgage provider capitalising on Labour\u2019s plans to build 1.5m new homes. The Bank of London, the fledgling clearing bank backed by the Labour grandee Lord Mandelson, has announced it has raised another \u00a342m from investors days after being hit by a winding-up order by tax authorities. The oil and gas supermajor BP is to use artificial intelligence to speed up the decision-making of its engineers, after signing a five-year deal with the US spy technology company Palantir. Japanese bank Nomura has a worrying prediction \u2013 they believe Germany has entered a three-quarters-long recession. It would be a relatively shallow downturn, though \u2013 Nomura predict a 0.4 percentage point drop in GDP, followed by stagnation. We already know that Germany shrank slightly in April-June; Nomura predict this contraction will continue. They say: Q2 2024 GDP growth contracted against expectations, with the expenditure breakdown indicating that the decline in domestic demand was more pronounced than expected. Official data suggest that Q3 is off to a poor start; July factory sales and industrial output fell materially, with August manufacturing surveys indicating further deterioration. Services surveys, too, have materially weakened in Q3 thus far relative to Q2. Germany\u2019s recession, in addition to France\u2019s stagnation, will weigh on euro area GDP growth, they predict \u2013 while the eurozone periphery will likely outperform due to tourism. Kim Fausing, President and CEO of Danish multinational company Danfoss, has welcomed Mario Draghi\u2019s report into Europe\u2019s competitiveness failings: Fausing says: \u201cEurope is falling behind and we need to shift gears. That\u2019s why I welcome Mr Draghi\u2019s report today and his call for a new industrial strategy for Europe. We\u2019ve known for some time that productivity in the EU is lagging behind other key markets, contributing to a decline in competitiveness. When you look at a list of 44 so-called critical technologies, Europe is not a leader in a single one. The Draghi report rightly points out that EU companies still face electricity prices that are 2-3 times those in the US and that natural gas prices paid are 4-5 times higher. This impacts production costs, and thereby also competitiveness. Fausing remains \u201ca stubborn optimist\u201d when it comes to Europe\u2019s future, but agrees that a change of mindset is needed \u2013 including a new industrial policy: We must step up and drive momentum by investing in innovation and focusing on Competitive Decarbonization. That is decarbonizing industries while making them more resilient and increasing economic competitiveness. I see a lot of momentum among industry leaders, and European companies have enormous potential if we get the right political framework and double down on energy efficiency, electrification and renewables. What I am calling for is an active, forward-looking industrial policy, which has a focus on implementation and follow-up that can create growth. Only by working together can we turn this around, ensure Europe takes a leading position in key sectors, and create high-quality jobs.\u201d Back in London, the FTSE 100 continues to rally. It\u2019s now up 71 points or 0.87% at 8252 points, more than recovering all of Friday\u2019s drop. That\u2019s despite analysts at UBS downgrading their view on UK shares to Neutral from Most Preferred. In a research note this morning, UBS says there are several reasons to be positive about UK equities \u2013 including the return of political stability, last month\u2019s interest rate cut by the Bank of England, and a likely return to earnings growth this year. Another advantage \u2013 UK stocks still suffer from \u201cundemanding valuations\u201d, with shares trading at a lower price/earnings ratio than the long-running average. So what\u2019s the problem? UBS analyst Dean Turner reckons these positive developments seem to be \u201clargely priced in\u201d, adding: \u2026.which suggests that UK equities will struggle to outperform their international peers in what we expect to be a positive year-end for stocks Turner does predict UK stocks will keep rallying, pushing the FTSE to rise to around 9,000 by year-end. That would be a new alltime high (the previous best was 8,474 points back in May). Over on Wall Street, shares have opened higher as investors try to put Friday\u2019s wobble behind them: Dow Jones Industrial Average: up 228 points or 0.57% at 40,574 points S&amp;P 500 share index: up 42 points or 0.8% at 5,451 points Nasdaq Composite, up 168 points or 1% at 16,858 points. Lucas Guttenberg, senior advisor at Bertelsmann Stiftung, says Mario Dragihi\u2019s report is \u201csurprisingly good\u201d \u2013 indeed, better than another report from another former Italian PM, Enrico Letta, into \u201cthe future of the single market\u201d. Over in Berlin, German economy minister Robert Habeck has vooiced support for Mario Draghi\u2019s proposals. Habeck says he agrees that the European Union needed massive investment, comprehensive reforms and strengthened resilience. He said: \u201cThe whole of Europe is facing existential challenges that we can only overcome together.\u201d \u201cDefence\u201d appears 90 times in Mario Draghi\u2019s report into Europe\u2019s competitiveness. Daniel Fiott, head of the defence and statecraft programme at the Centre for Security, Diplomacy and Strategy, has summarised the main points: The Dutch government have given a slightly lukewarm response to Mario Draghi\u2019s proposals to fix Europe\u2019s competitiveness problems. Amsterdam says it agrees with some of Draghi\u2019s ideas, but also cautions that public investments must not be seen as an \u201cend in themselves.\u201d In remarks sent to Reuters by the Economic Affairs ministry, a spokesperson said the Netherlands was still studying the former European Central Bank chief\u2019s new report but that it agreed with the need for more integrated European policy and less \u201cregulatory burden\u201d. The Netherlands\u2019 conservative government has a reference in its governing pact that it does not support creating new instruments for sharing debt at the European level. European lithium-ion battery maker Northvolt is an illustration of the problems Mario Draghi is concerned about. Northvolt is to cut jobs and sell or seek partners for its energy storage and materials businesses, the Financial Times reports, as it tries to ride out problems in Europe\u2019s move to electric cars. The company has decided to pause its cathode active material production, selling one site and buying instead from Chinese or Korean companies, the FT says. This will help it focus on first gigafactory in northern Sweden, which began production in 2021. Peter Carlsson, Northvolt\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, has explained: \u201cBuilding a battery company from scratch is a profoundly capital-intensive and challenging endeavour. We have come a long way\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. \u2009Now it\u2019s time to focus on the core, to learn from the past and to scale up our core business to make sure that we can meet our customers\u2019 expectations and to help Europe achieve a sustainable battery ecosystem, Europe also needs to take steps to increase and secures its access to critical raw materials (CRMs), today\u2019s competition report says. Those CRMs include metals used in clean energy technologies such as lithium, cobalt and nickel. China is the single largest processer of nickel, copper, lithium and cobalt, the report says, pointing to Beijing\u2019s \u201cwillingness to use its market power\u201d: Export restrictions from the country grew by a factor of nine between 2009 and 2020. Little progress is being made so far with diversification. Europe, the report concludes, is \u201cfalling behind\u201d in the global race to secure supply chains: Alongside its dominant position in processing and refining, China is actively investing in mining assets in Africa and Latin America and overseas refining via its Belt and Road initiative. Its overseas investment in metals and mining through the Belt and Road Initiative reached a record high of $10bn in the first half of 2023 alone, and it plans to double the ownership of overseas mines containing critical minerals by Chinese companies. The US has deployed the IRA, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and defence funding to develop at scale domestic processing, refining and recycling capacity, as well as using its geopolitical power to secure the global supply chain. Japan is highly dependent on other regions for CRMs, and since the 2000s it has developed a strategic approach to increase access to overseas mining projects. The Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security invests equity in mining and refining assets around the world, manages strategic stockpiling and, since the introduction of the recent economic security law, has powers to develop processing and refining facilities within Japan. Europe, by contrast, has a comparable level of dependencies, being highly dependent on one or two countries for most of its critical mineral imports. However, it is not following a similarly coordinated approach. The EU is lacking a comprehensive strategy covering all stages of the supply chain (from exploration to recycling) and, unlike its competitors, the mining and trading of commodities is largely left to private actors and the market. A key message running though Mario Draghi\u2019s report into Europe\u2019s competitiveness problems is that member states need to bolster their collective efforts and work together better. That includes combining its spending power, winning foreign direct investment together, and using its bargaining power to negotiate cheaper energy. But the most controversial part of the report could be the suggestion that Europe should start regularly issuing \u201ccommon safe assets\u201d to fund joint investment projects among Member States and to help integrate capital markets. That would be a step towards eurobonds, in which member states issue collective debt. Eurobonds were proposed as a solution to Europe\u2019s debt crisis over a decade ago \u2013 the problem is that wealthier, more frugal Northern European countries fear being responsible for debt issued for their Southern neighbours. The economic crisis in Germany, though, may mean those fears are less strong. Some collective EU debt has already been issued in recent years, under the Next Generation EU (NGEU) project to fund the recovery from the pandemic. Draghi\u2019s report suggests the NGEU model can be \u201cbuilt on\u201d, to issue common debt instruments, to finance \u201cjoint investment projects that will increase the EU\u2019s competitiveness and security\u201d. On defence, Mario Draghi argues that EU members must \u201cjoin forces\u201d to help European manufacturers. His report says points out that the EU is collectively the world\u2019s second largest military spender \u2013 but only a fifth of that money goes to EU companies: European collaborative procurement accounted for less than a fifth of spending on defence equipment procurement in 2022. We also do not favour competitive European defence companies. Between mid-2022 and mid-2023, 78% of total procurement spending went to non-EU suppliers, out of which 63% went to the US. The competition report also flags that the \u201cprolonged period of peace in Europe and the US security umbrella\u201d has allowed countries to cut defence spending (to fund other commitments). Now, only ten Member States now spend more than or equal to 2% of GDP in line with NATO commitments, although defence expenditures are rising\u2026. Skimming though Mario Draghi\u2019s report, there\u2019s a stark warning that Europe\u2019s position in the advanced technologies that will drive future growth is declining. It poounts out that only four of the world\u2019s top 50 tech companies are European and the EU\u2019s share of global tech revenues dropped from 22% to 18% between 2013 and 2023, while the US share rose from 30% to 38%. The report says: Technological change is accelerating rapidly. Europe largely missed out on the digital revolution led by the internet and the productivity gains it brought: in fact, the productivity gap between the EU and the US is largely explained by the tech sector. The EU is weak in the emerging technologies that will drive future growth. Only four of the world\u2019s top 50 tech companies are European. The Draghi report shows clearly how Europe\u2019s weak productivity growth has led to slower income growth and weaker domestic demand in Europe. On a per capita basis, real disposable income has grown almost twice as much in the US as in the EU since 2000, it says. The report says: EU economic growth has been persistently slower than in the US over the past two decades, while China has been rapidly catching up. This chart shows how Europe\u2019s economy has struggled to keep up with both the US and China since 2002: You can read Mario Draghi\u2019s new report into Europe\u2019s economic problems here: The future of European competitiveness It explains that to digitalise and decarbonise the economy and increase defence capacity, the investment share in Europe will have to rise by around 5 percentage points of GDP. That would take it back to levels last seen in the 1960s and 70s. And it\u2019s much, much larger than the Marshall Plan \u2013 which between 1948-51 amounted to around 1-2% of GDP annually. The report declares firmly that Europe faces an existential challenge, saying: If Europe cannot become more productive, we will be forced to choose. We will not be able to become, at once, a leader in new technologies, a beacon of climate responsibility and an independent player on the world stage. We will not be able to finance our social model. We will have to scale back some, if not all, of our ambitions. And in an eye-catching warning to European policymakers, the report warns that if the EU cannot deliver \u201cprosperity, equity, freedom, peace and democracy\u201d then it will have lost its reason for being. Onto questions\u2026 Q: Are the EU\u2019s rules on mergers holding back competition? Mario Draghi says his report says competition policy should consider \u201cinnovation\u201d, and \u201cresilience\u201d. It also proposes changes to the EU\u2019s state aid rules, saying: State aid should be used for projects of common interests, and commonly funded, cross-border projects But it should be stopped for other things, as it fragments the single market. The report also recommends that competition decisions are made more \u2018forward looking\u2019, rather than being \u2018prudential\u2019, and also recommends faster decisions on competition law. Draghi adds that he is confident that \u201cin our unity we will find the strength to reform\u201d. Ad then he hands his weighty report onto the President of the European Commission, Ursula von de Leyen. Mario Draghi then warns reporters in Brussels that Europe faces very serious challenges. Explaining the importance of taking the steps outlined in his new report, Draghi says: We have to understand we are becoming ever smaller relative to the challenges we face. For the first time since the Cold War we must genuinely fear for our self-preservation. Draghi touches on the question of how such massive spending is possible. He says it is unlikely that private investment alone can finance it alone \u2013 without destabilising the EU economy. So, some form of common funding, and joint safe asset, will be needed. The third part of Draghi\u2019s report looks at increasing security and reducing dependencies. That includes economic dependencies \u2013 as the raw materials Europe needs are in the hands of a few suppliers\u2026. \u2026and also security dependencies, even though geopolitics have \u201csignificantly worsened\u201d in the last 10 years. Draghi\u2019s solution \u2013 Europe must develop a \u201cforeign economic policy\u201d. That means\u2026. Cordinating preferential trade agreements and direct investments with resource-rich countries, building up stockpiles in selected critical areas, and creating industrial partnerships to secure the supply chain for key technologies. And, we need to build our defence industrial capacity. Draghi concedes that these goals are not new \u2013 member states are doing this on their own. But they are punching \u2018under our power\u2019 \u2013 Europe coould be more effective if it combined its resources and coordinated policies, he argues. Europe must also increase the supply of clean energy, Mario Draghi adds. He cites Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) as an example of how incentives can be used to stimulate development of green technologies. China\u2019s state sponsored competition is a threat to developing the European clean energy sector, he says. Draghi\u2019s second recommendation is that Europe must combine \u201cdecarbonisation with competitiveness.\u201d He says decarbonisation is an opportunity for growth, but one that could be missed if European countries fail to coordinate. Draghi says Europe needs a plan to decouples the price of fossil fuels from clean energy sources, so consumers see benefits from decarbonisation in their bills. [currently, fossil fuels are still the main power plants \u201cat the margin\u201d, and hence often set the wholesale electricity price in Europe \u2013 as this paper explains]. Europe\u2019s problem is not that it lacks smart people, or good ideas, Mario Draghi continues. The problem, he argues, is that there are too many barriers to commercial innovations, and to scaling them up. Draghi then points out that since 2008, 30% of unicorns - tech firms that grow to become worth over \u20ac1bn \u2013 which started in the EU have left. The majority went to the US, Draghi adds: 30% of our most succesful innovators have moved, and this has to change. Europe must become a place where innovation flourishes, especially for digital tech. A weak tech sector will rob Europe of the growth opportunities of the AI revolution, and also hamper companies in the rest of the economy too, he warns. Mario Draghi then outlines the steps Europe must take \u2013 starting with closing the innovation gap with the United States. Innovation is the first pillar of the report, he explains, citing Europe\u2019s failure to keep up with Big Tech firms. Giving a gloomy assessment of the situation, Draghi says: Europe is nowaways stuck in a static industrial structure, populated by mid-technology companies which are already mature. The leading firms in research and investment spending are the same ones we had 20 year ago \u2013 our cars. Draghi adds that it was the same picture in the US 20 years ago- where their big R&amp;D spenders were \"autos and pharma\u201d. Now, though, it\u2019s all digital at the top, Draghi adds. Over in Brussels, Mario Draghi is calling for coordinated industrial policy and a huge increase in investment to improve the economic situation in the European Union and lift competitiveness. Draghi, the former European Central Bank chief and Italian prime minister, is presenting a new report on the future of EU competitiveness, which he has been working on for the last year. In it, he calls for a much more coordinated industrial policy, more rapid decisions and massive investment to stop Europe falling further behind the US and China. Draghi says that Europe needs to boost its investment by up to five percentage points of GDP \u2013 or up to \u20ac800bn a year - and much closer coordination between European countries to ensure the money is spent effectively. Draghi says his report proposes a \u201cnew industrial strategy for Europe\u201d, and is granular with 170 different topline proposals. Speaking in Brussels now, Draghi warns that Europe\u2019s productivity is \u201cweak, very weak\u201d, and point out that growth has been slowing down for a long time. World trade is slowing, and become less open to European countries, Draghi says, adding that Europe has also lost its main supplier of cheap energy, Russia. Also, it needs to invest more in defence, for the first time since second world war. Another hurdle, Draghi adds, is that this is the first year that Europe cannot count on population growth to lift growth. Draghi\u2019s report is likely to influence the debate on EU competitiveness, one of the priorities of the next European Commission, which is due to take office later this year. Introducing Draghi, EC president Ursula von der Leyen said there is a \u201cwide consensus\u201d that the issue of improving Europe\u2019s competitiveness must be \u201cat the top of our agenda and at the heart of our action\u201d. Investor morale across the euro area has fallen for the third month in a row. The Sentix Investor Confidence Index has dropped to -15.4 this month, down from -13.9 in August, and lower than forecast. Sentix warns that the eurozone economy is \u201cthreatening to tip into recession\u201d, and blames the economic problems in Germany. It says: The eurozone is struggling with dangerous recessionary tendencies \u2018thanks to Germany\u2019. The situation in the rest of the world is also weakening, but investors here are somewhat more optimistic in their expectations. Germany is on the brink of recession after its GDP shrank in the second quarter of this year. Its economy has been hit by high energy costs since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and its car sector has struggled to cope with competition from cheaper Chinese-built electric vehicles. Barratt and Lloyds Banking Group have launched a \u00a3150m joint venture with the government body Homes England, that will lead to the UK\u2019s largest housebuilder and mortgage provider capitalising on Labour\u2019s plans to build 1.5m new homes. The combined venture, known as the MADE Partnership, will oversee multiple large-scale projects, including town extensions, new garden village-style communities and brownfield developments, each made up of 1,000 to 100,000 homes and community facilities. The government\u2019s housing and regeneration body, Homes England, said the partnership would \u201c have the finance, tools, expertise and partners required to ensure a cohesive approach to delivering a fabulous place that people want to live and work\u201d. The venture will initially be backed by up to \u00a3150m in funding, provided by Barratt, Homes England and Lloyds, which will hold equal equity stakes. But while MADE has described as a \u201clong-term partnership\u201d, the announcement of its launch on Monday did not included any timescale or housebuilding targets. We also have worrying signs that the US jobs market is cooling. The latest UK Report on Jobs from KPMG and REC shows that the UK labour market softened in August, with vacancies falling for both permanent and temporary staff. The number of permanent staff positions fell at the fastest rate since March, for the 23rd month in a row, with reports of \u201creduced demand amongst companies for new staff\u201d. This has led to a slowdown in earnings growth \u2013 permanent salaries meanwhile continued to rise, but at the weakest pace since March. Pay for temporary positions rose at the weakest pace for three-and-a-half years. Bad news for workers \u2013 but it may cheer the Bank of England, as it looks for signs that inflationary pressures have eased. Jon Holt, chief executive and Senior Partner of KPMG in the UK, suggests the gloomy tone from the new Labour government may be deterring firms from taking on staff. Holt explains: \u201cRecent Government warnings that the UK\u2019s economy may weaken further before improving add to the overall sense of uncertainty, affecting recruitment plans. Firms holding back from hiring led to a sharp contraction in the number of people placed into permanent roles in August amid continued decline in demand, extending the downturn in the UK\u2019s labour market. \u201cThe news that while salaries rose last month it was at the weakest rate since March could help make the case for more rate cuts when the [Bank of England\u2019s] Monetary Policy Committee meets to decide the future path of interest rates. A second survey from accountancy firm BDO also shows the UK jobs market weakening. BDO\u2019s employment index has fallen for the fourteenth consecutive month, to its lowest reading since January 2013. BDO says: This reflects ongoing concerns in the job market, including falling job vacancies and more people claiming unemployment-related benefits, which reached its highest level since December 2021 according to the Office for National Statistics. Elsewhere in the airline industry, Boeing may have struck a deal to avoid a strike which would have added to its list of problems. Boeing said yesterday it has reached a tentative agreement with a union representing more than 32,000 workers in the US Pacific Northwest. The proposed four-year contract includes a general wage increase of 25%, a commitment to build the next commercial airplane in the Seattle area, and better retirement benefits. If ratified by Boeing factory workers near Seattle and Portland on Thursday, the deal could help avert a possible crippling strike set for as early as 13 September. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 called it \u201cthe best contract we\u2019ve negotiated in our history\u201d. The deal also gived the union greater input in the safety and quality of Boeing\u2019s production system \u2013 an area in the spotlight following the crashes of two 737 Max jetliners, and the loss of a cabin panel in a midair blowout. In the airline industry, Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary has issued a fresh call for the chief executive of air traffic control (ATC) provider Nats to resign. O\u2019Leary urged Martin Rolfe to step down and \u201callow someone competent\u201d to take over after flights were disrupted at Gatwick Airport on Sunday due to \u201cNats staff shortages\u201d. The Ryanair chief declared: \u201cUK Nats staff shortages caused multiple flight delays and cancellations at Gatwick Airport yesterday, Sunday September 8. \u201cThis is the latest in a long line of cock-ups by UK Nats, which has yet again disrupted multiple flights and thousands of passengers at Gatwick. Airlines and passengers deserve better. \u201cRyanair again calls on UK Nats chief executive Martin Rolfe to step down and allow someone competent to run an efficient UK ATC service, which airlines and passengers are entitled to expect. \u201cIf he won\u2019t go, then (new Transport Secretary) Louise Haigh should sack him.\u201d Nats was hit by criticism last year, when a single piece of rogue data in a flight plan caused thousands of flights to be cancelled, and when staff illness forced flights to be grounded at Gatwick: The pound has slipped to its lowest level in nearly a week this morning. Sterling is down 0.2% at $1.3095, the first time it\u2019s been below $1.31 since last Tuesday. Stocks are rebounding in London at the start of trading, after the worst week of 2024 so far. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is up 49 points, or 0.6%, at 8230 points \u2013 clawing back over three-quarters of Friday\u2019s fall. Gambling firm Entain is the top riser, up 5.6%, after reporting online revenue growth ahead of expectations this morning. Banks and mining companies are also among the risers. But luxury group Burberry is a rare faller, down 1.5%. Luxury stocks have been hit recently by concerns that China\u2019s economic recovery was faltering; Burberry is already being ejected from the FTSE 100 in the next reshuffle. Economic slowdown worries hit the oil price last week, sending it to its lowest level in almost 18 months. This morning, though, Brent crude has gained almost 1%, rising to $71.10 per barrel. This is partly due to concerns over a potential hurricane system approaching the U.S. Gulf Coast, which could possibly cause disruption to supplies. A weather system in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico is forecast to become a hurricane before it reaches the northwestern U.S. Gulf Coast, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Sunday. The U.S. Gulf Coast accounts for some 60% of U.S. refining capacity, Reuters reports. However, Morgan Stanley has cut its forecast for oil prices in the final quarter of this year. It now predicts Brent crude will average $75 a barrel in October-December, down from an earlier projection of $80/barrel. Aldi\u2019s UK boss has also revealed that its shoppers are treating themselves to more expensive products as cost of living pressures start to ease. The supermarket reports that customers are \u201ctrading up\u201d to its premium own-label products such as Wagyu steak, premium cheese, ready meals, brioche buns and smoked salmon. Aldi UK chief executive Giles Hurley has told the BBC: \u201cIt\u2019s still tough out there for millions of families but inflationary pressures are easing for some. \u201cFor others, it\u2019ll be a decision not to use hospitality but to celebrate at home instead.\u201d Aldi is to open a further 23 stores this year after profits more than doubled last year to almost \u00a3537m. The supermarket has just announced it would invest \u00a3800m in the UK market through the rest of this year including opening 23 more stores, and had signed a \u00a3750m deal with Kent-based grower AC Goatham &amp; Son including establishing the first ever \u2018Aldi Orchard\u2019 on a 200-acre plot on New Green Farm in Gravesend dedicated to growing fruit for the chain. The supermarket \u2013 which opened about 30 stores last year \u2013 said sales increased 16% to \u00a317.9bn in 2023, its highest ever period of sales growth. However, since then sales growth has slowed as all the traditional grocers, including Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s, have introduced schemes to price match Aldi on key items. The group will open about 30 stores again this year in total, down from about 50 per annum in the years before 2023. The retailer, which currently has over 1,000 stores, has previously announced plans to scale to 1,500 stores across the UK. The retailer, which aims to be the cheapest in the UK, said it had invested almost \u00a3100m in over 300 price cuts in the last three months on items including fish goujons, chicken breasts, potatoes and basmati rice. Giles Hurley, the chief executive of Aldi UK and Ireland, said: \u201cFor every \u00a31 of profit generated last year, we\u2019re investing \u00a32 this year - opening more stores and building the supply infrastructure to bring high-quality, affordable groceries to millions more families the length and breadth of Britain.\u201d Chinese producers continue to slash their prices, new data today shows, in a sign of weak demand. China\u2019s producer price index (PPI) \u2013 which tracks prices at the factory gate \u2013 fell by 1.8% in August compared with a year earlier. That\u2019s the largest fall in four months, and a bigger decline than expected \u2013 which will add to concerns over the health of the global economy. Junyu Tan, North Asia Economist at Coface, explains: \u201cThe ongoing deflationary pressures boil down into a broader problem of production surplus, which is still outstripping demand.\u201d However, this did not immediately feed through to consumers\u2019 pockets. China\u2019s headline CPI inflation rate rose to 0.6% in the year to August, up from 0.5% in July. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. Here we go again (again). Investors are experiencing another bout of angst over the health of the US economy, creating a chilly feel in the markets. Spirits are low after Friday\u2019s disappointing US employment report, which showed that fewer jobs were created last month than hoped. Non-farm payrolls rose by just 142,000 in August, while the payrolls for June and July were slashed, leaving traders fretting that the US jobs market \u2013 and the wider economy \u2013 was cooling. In better news, the unemployment rate dipped to 4.2% \u2013 but the report overall has left investors baffled as to how the US Federal Reserve will react. An interest rate cut later this month feels inked in \u2013 but will it be a gentle quarter-percentage point (25 basis points) reduction, or a dramatic half-point cut? Instinctively, investors would like a larger cut in borrowing costs \u2013 except, if that happens, it implies the Fed has serious concerns over the health of the US economy. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, explains: For traders, this means more of the Fed\u2019s favourite guessing game. The report wasn\u2019t bad enough to scream \u201cpanic mode,\u201d but indeed not good enough to keep the 50 bp rate cut whispers at bay. The problem? This delicate balancing act leaves everyone wondering: will the Fed take a cautious 25 bps step, or does a bigger 50 bps cut suddenly feel more necessary? One thing\u2019s for sure: whatever the Fed does, the markets are left doing the one thing they hate most\u2014waiting in uncertainty. And we can see the impact of this in the markets. On Friday, the US S&amp;P 500 share index fell by 1.7%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite tumbled by 2.5%. This has knocked Asia-Pacific markets today, where China\u2019s main stock indices are down over 1%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng is down almost 2%, and the South Korean Kospi index is off 0.7%. Disappointing economic growth figures from Japan have added to the gloom; Japan\u2019s Q2 GDP growth rate has been revised down to an annualised rate of 2.9% for April-June, down from a preliminary estimate of 3.1%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei share index began the session with a 3% drop, but actually managed to claw its way back to finish 0.5% lower. European markets, which fell on Friday, are set for a slightly higher open: The agenda 9.30am BST: TUC Annual congress in Brighton 9.30am BST: Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence"

            "date": "2024-09-30T16:57:34Z",
            "content": "Nearly 50 years ago, a rediscovered diary enchanted the nation. Edith Holden\u2019s Nature Notes for 1906 \u2013 published in 1977 as The Country Diary of an Edwardian Lady \u2013 captured the artist and schoolteacher\u2019s observations on the English countryside\u2019s changing seasons, accompanied by exquisite illustrations of its flora and fauna. My friend Richard Webb, who has died aged 81, was the man who saw the potential of a dusty manuscript and turned it into a global bestseller. He had been shown the illustrated diary in 1976 by Holden\u2019s 22-year-old great-niece Rowena, then a student at Exeter Art College, whom he had met at a party, and he brought the book out the following year. \u201cCountry Diary chimed perfectly with those times \u2013 it was rural nostalgia with a safe, beautiful look people wanted after the 1970s recession,\u201d Richard later told an interviewer. The diary sold more than 3m copies around the world and was spun off into gift merchandising ranging from dinner plates to duvet covers, as well as a 12-part television dramatisation in 1984. It transformed the fortunes of Webb &amp; Bower, the small independent Devon publisher that Richard had founded with his friend Delian Bower in 1975. The son of Lt Col Richard Webb and his wife, Iris (nee Ingram), he was born in Reigate, Surrey, where his father was stationed at the time. Although he grew up in a military rather than a literary family, Richard was an instinctive publisher. After school at Marlborough college and a very brief stint as a Royal Navy officer cadet, he studied at the City Lit in London and the London College of Printing and in 1966 landed a gofer job with Cond\u00e9 Nast. Before long he was in charge of its publishing division and nurtured books from contributors as diverse as Mary Berry and David Bailey. Richard was especially proud of his role in publishing Bailey\u2019s Goodbye Baby and Amen (1969), a photographic essay on the Swinging Sixties, which could have been Richard\u2019s own diary of life in Chelsea at that time. He had great charm and a formidable work ethic, a combination that saw him appointed publicity director of the publishing house Michael Joseph aged just 27. He worked with a wide range of authors, including James Baldwin and Spike Milligan, enjoying their company as much as they did his. Despite Richard\u2019s success in London, his heart was in the West Country, and specifically Dartmouth in Devon, where his mother came from and to where his family had returned during his childhood. By 1994, after many years living in Exeter, he headed back to Dartmouth, planning on semi-retirement in a cottage next to the river. But he was too much of a natural publisher to sit and watch the River Dart flow past his window. The local historian Don Collinson brought him a manuscript, and The Chronicles of Dartmouth: An Historical Yearly Log, 1854-1954 (2000) became the first of a dozen books he produced involving the town and its people. \u201cAs a teenager I couldn\u2019t wait to get out but I now think it\u2019s an amazing place,\u201d he would tell visiting friends. In 1992 Richard married Gilly Jenkins, and she survives him."

            "date": "2024-09-04T15:00:42Z",
            "content": "The June quarter GDP figures released yesterday reveal just how badly the Reserve Bank has misread the economy. Its decision to sharply raise interest rates has not only failed to reduce inflation but delivered an economy reliant on population growth and government spending to stop it from going into a recession. A month ago, when announcing the bank would keep rates on hold, the RBA governor, Michele Bullock, told the media that \u201cthe board does remain concerned about the degree of excess demand in the economy\u201d. Well, she should be happy now because the latest GDP figures show there is no demand in the economy. Household spending fell in the June quarter and business investment barely did a thing. She also told reporters \u201cwhat we\u2019re dealing with is continued strong demand, particularly for services\u201d. Again, she should be ecstatic because household spending on services fell 0.3% in the June quarter (that would be a month before she was telling us we needed to be worried about the \u201cstrong demand\u201d). Also last month, the assistant governor of the RBA, Dr Sarah Hunter, suggested to a Senate committee that \u201cthe economy is running a little bit hotter than we thought previously\u201d. Well, pop the champagne, because the economy is now chilly cold. These figures show that in April, May and June \u2013 well before the fears expressed in August of \u201cstrong demand\u201d\u2013 the economy was shuddering to a halt. The June quarter figures also mean we can look at financial year growth figures, and the 2023-24 year was not one we would wish to revisit. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The entire economy grew just 1.5%. If we ignore the abnormal 2020-21 pandemic year, it is the worst result since 1991-92. To make things worse, when we strip out population growth, GDP fell 1%. Out of the 65 financial years we have had since the Bureau of Statistics began calculating GDP, that is only the 10th time that has happened: If the graph does not display, click here So no. Not good. And no, not \u201crunning a bit hot\u201d. When we look at the quarterly figures, things are no better. Take out population growth and the economy shrank 0.4%. That makes it six consecutive quarters of falling GDP per capita. This hasn\u2019t happened before. If the graph does not display, click here Depressed enough? OK, how about we note that the only reason the total economy rose a pathetic 0.2% and an equally wretched 1.0% compared with June 2023 was because of government spending: If the graph does not display, click here That means the private sector \u2013 household spending, business investment and trade \u2013 all went backwards. This really should be a slap in the face to those who have been going around whining about a profligate government keeping inflation too high. What bull! Government spending is the only thing that is keeping us out of a recession. And the reason the private sector is going backwards is interest rates. The increase in the cash rate from 0.1% to 4.35% has meant that we are now paying on average in real terms almost as much on interest repayments as we were in June 2008 \u2013 when the cash rate was 7.25%: If the graph does not display, click here In the March 2022 quarter, Australians were paying $479 a quarter per person in interest repayments (in June 2024 dollars). Now it is $1,112. That increase has caused almost half of the drop in real household disposable income, which remains back where it was in 2014: If the graph does not display, click here The increase in rates would be somewhat palatable if we were at least seeing a nice increase in our earnings but instead the real compensation for employees is more or less flat: If the graph does not display, click here Add rising interest payments with earnings that barely keep up with inflation and it equals households not spending. In the June quarter, we actually consumed less than we did in the first three months of this year. And given households make up just over half of the economy, that does not bode well. If the graph does not display, click here Our spending on essentials \u2013 insurance, food, healthcare \u2013 rose 0.5%, but the amount of discretionary consumption \u2013 things such as recreation, travel, dining out, sport \u2013 fell 1.1%. Outside the pandemic years, that is the biggest one-quarter fall since the GFC in June 2008. So far we have not gone into a recession \u2013 but only because our population has grown and the government has kept spending, mostly on healthcare and social assistance linked to the NDIS. The next lot of GDP figures will contain the stage 3 tax cuts, which should boost household incomes. Similarly, a lack of any more interest rate rises should at least mean we\u2019re no longer getting hit, even if the pain of all the punches remains. But given the economy has clearly slowed sooner than the RBA expected, perhaps it might start to think about lowering rates sooner than previously anticipated.

            "content": "Wall Street scaled all-time highs on Thursday as global markets welcomed the US Federal Reserve\u2019s first interest rate cut in four years. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 climbed 1.7% to close at its first record high since July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3% and also hit a record. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite rallied by 2.5%. When the Fed announced it would reduce rates from a two-decade high on Wednesday, cutting by 50 basis points, America\u2019s leading share indices closed lower. On Thursday, however, as global markets welcomed the news, they bounced back. As inflation continues to fade in the US, policymakers at the Fed also expect to cut rates by an additional 50 basis points this year, according to projections released alongside this week\u2019s announcement. Some analysts said the market could be relieved that Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, was able to thread the needle in his press conference and suggest the deeper-than-usual cut was just a \u201crecalibration\u201d of policy and not an urgent move it had to take to prevent a recession. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything in the economy that suggests the likelihood of a downturn is elevated,\u201d Powell told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t see that.\u201d The FTSE 100 climbed 0.9% in London after the Bank of England opted to hold interest rates steady. The next key central banking move is due on Friday, when the Bank of Japan will announce its latest decision on rates. As the Fed sought a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d for the US economy, where price growth is normalized and recession avoided, US stock markets have enjoyed an extraordinary year. The S&amp;P 500 is up by more than 20% since the start of 2024. The Nasdaq has risen 22% over the same period. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased 11%.

            "date": "2024-09-06T20:30:11Z",
            "content": "US employers added 142,000 jobs last month, the labor department announced on Friday, in one of the year\u2019s most closely watched economic news releases. The release comes as the US Federal Reserve prepares to cut interest rates for the first time since March 2020, and November\u2019s election puts a spotlight on the state of the US economy. The reading for August was shy of the average forecast increase of 163,000 jobs by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The labor department also cut its figures for the number of new hires for June and July by a combined 86,000 jobs, a further sign that the remarkable post-pandemic hiring boom is weakening. The headline unemployment rate also decreased from 4.3% to 4.2%, in line with expectations. US stock markets fell as investors worried about a weakening economy and fears that the artificial intelligence boom may prove less lucrative than first thought. The tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 2.6% with the broader S&amp;P 500 down 1.7% and Dow Jones industrial average down 1%. Over five trading sessions, the S&amp;P suffered its worst week since 2023. The Nasdaq endured its worst week since 2022. Tech companies including Nvidia, the chips giant, and Alphabet, owner of Google and YouTube, led Friday\u2019s sell-off. The economy is ranked as one of the most important issues heading into November\u2019s presidential election, amid significant unease over its strength. Donald Trump led Kamala Harris by 3% in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll on the candidates\u2019 approaches to the economy and employment. Last month, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics made a significant revision, lowering the number of job created in the 12 months to March by 818,000, or 0.5%, the largest revision since 2009. The revision tapered job increase reports to about 174,000 jobs a month added, compared with the previously reported rate of about 242,000 jobs a month. The revision came amid signs that the jobs market is weakening. On Wednesday the labor department reported that the number of job openings has fallen to its lowest level in three and a half years. The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, recently signaled plans to reduce interest rates when the central bank holds its next meeting on 17 and 18 September, declaring that \u201cthe time has come\u201d for the Fed to act. \u201cThe direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,\u201d he said. Two years ago, when inflation was soaring during the pandemic, policymakers at the Fed scrambled to cool the US economy by raising rates to a two-decade high. Now that price growth is falling back \u2013 it rose at an annual rate of 2.9% in July, having faded from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 \u2013 they are preparing to cut rates, but have yet to do so. Officials hope to guide the US to a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d, whereby inflation is normalized, and recession avoided. The Fed\u2019s target for inflation is 2%. In recent months, critics of the Fed have accused the central bank of sitting on its hands and derailing the US economy, amid unease over its direction. An unexpectedly weak jobs report for July, which came a day after the Fed again chose to hold rates steady, sparked a fleeting global sell-off. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the report showed \u201cthe labor market is clearly experiencing a marked slowdown\u201d but \u201coverall, still consistent with an economy experiencing a soft landing rather than plummeting into recession\u201d."

            "date": "2024-09-07T20:00:27Z",
            "content": "In a week dominated by headlines declaring the \u201cweakest growth in decades\u201d (excluding Covid) with an economy being \u201csmashed\u201d by the Reserve Bank, it might seem Australia teeters on the edge on an abyss. For some households and businesses, the challenge of paying stratospheric housing costs amid 13-year-high interest rates will alas be overwhelming. For the bulk of the population, though, there is an option of optimism. It might not be a Panglossian \u201cbest of possible times\u201d but the worst may already be behind us (provided large, lurking problems remain at bay). Sure, the June quarter national accounts weren\u2019t champagne-worthy. Per capita GDP fell for a record sixth quarter in a row to be 2% lower than its recent peak in the June quarter of 2022, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said. However, in that statistical cherry tree, it\u2019s not hard to pick a lot of decent fruit from rotten ones. That cumulative per capita drop, for instance, wasn\u2019t great but as the seasoned economist Saul Eslake notes, four other downturns since the 1960s prompted by tighter monetary policy produced declines of between 2.8% and 6.3%. (The latter related to a painful 1981-83 recession overseen by the then treasurer John Howard who was this week busy providing advice to the current incumbent Jim Chalmers.) Media usually focuses on news. The June quarter data wasn\u2019t in fact newsy, since we\u2019ve known for months we\u2019d get the weakest growth figures in this current slowdown. (The RBA\u2019s 0.9% annual growth forecast was narrowly exceeded, nor does the governor, Michele Bullock, observe a \u201csmashed\u201d nation.) Aside from Covid-era contortions, Australia\u2019s economy has reliably grown for decades. Our swelling population has helped, as has China\u2019s voracious demand for our commodities (and university places), lifting living standards without us having to be particularly savvy. Yes, consumers are under the pump, with households saving just 0.9% of income in the year to June, the lowest since 2006-07, the ABS said. That ratio, though, should pick up this quarter and beyond as the stage-three tax cuts (revised by the Albanese government amid a storm of media angst earlier this year) do their thing. The $23bn in federal tax cuts are the equivalent of two RBA rate cuts of 25 basis points. But they\u2019re spread out over the year, and early indications \u2013 such as flat retail turnover in July \u2013 suggest households aren\u2019t in a splurging mood that would concern an RBA board still wary about ruling out another interest rate hike. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email In fact, additional savings would fatten the buffer most \u2013 but not all \u2013 families have to cope with any further economic slowdown. (Household wealth is also up almost $2tn, or 13%, since May 2022.) Bullock on Thursday said that, yes, some might be forced to sell their homes because they couldn\u2019t meet debt repayments. However, \u201cdespite the pressure on household budgets, only a small share of borrowers is currently at risk of falling behind on their mortgage repayments\u201d. Less than an hour after wrapping up her speech, the Council of Financial Regulators \u2013 of which Bullock is a member \u2013 echoed that surety. Despite global risks remaining elevated and challenging domestic conditions, Australia\u2019s financial system \u201ccontinued to display a high level of resilience\u201d, the council said in its quarterly update. \u201c[M]ost Australian household and business borrowers were managing pressure on their finances; loan arrears were picking up only gradually and from a low level,\u201d it said. Inflation, meanwhile, seems to be back trending lower, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics\u2019 gauge excluding volatile items dropping to 3.7% in July, its lowest level since January 2022. Global oil prices are wilting to one-year lows, implying good news for motorists. That other inflation bane \u2013 the rental market \u2013 is now at its weakest since the early phases of the pandemic, CoreLogic said on Friday. The case for cautious hope hinges largely on employment continuing to defy dismal consumer and business sentiment surveys. Provided people keep finding work and the hours they need, they should be able to service loans and buy necessities, at least. Since the RBA began lifting its cash rate (and the Albanese government took office) in May 2022, the economy has added almost 1m jobs, extending a run that remains perplexingly positive. Joblessness is up from 3.9% then to 4.2% in July, a rate still low by historical levels \u2013 a remarkable result, given soaring interest rates and a record share of the population (67.1%) in the labour market. Eslake says that\u2019s the story Chalmers should be trumpeting. The government is attempting to stop the economy stalling and people losing their jobs in droves. \u201cChalmers can say, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s working,\u2019\u201d he says, rather than saying the RBA was \u201csmashing the economy\u201d when it\u2019s not smashed. The rosy jobs cherry might yet turn sour. One labour hire manager points to dwindling profits at Ashley Services and IT specialist PeopleIn as portents of a downturn. He also reckons corporate grief tends to be most acute a year after interest rates peak when relatively painless measures have been exhausted. Unless the RBA has another unpleasant rates whack to wield, we should be near that stress peak. Job vacancies are turning lower, and were a quarter off their peak as of May, the ABS said. This data will be updated on 26 September, two days after the RBA\u2019s next board meeting. However, the economy boasted 353,000 job openings, some 55%, or 125,000, more than in February 2020 when the pandemic began ramping up. Smaller firms are generally considered more at risk than larger ones. Judo Bank\u2019s latest survey of small- and medium-sized enterprises, released on Friday, offered another cheery cherry. Business confidence for August climbed to its highest level since January 2023 \u201cas price pressures lessened\u201d, the bank said. Business conditions were also above the 50.0 neutral mark for the first time in three months and rising at the fastest clip since April. Manufacturing, too, is preparing \u201ca major rise\u201d in investment next year, the ABS said. Signs of an upturn are vulnerable to shocks, such as China\u2019s slowdown being much worse than official data suggest (as this recent visitor contends), or US elections trigger violent disputes. More weird weather, fuelled by global heating, is a given. In the meanwhile, though, positive tidings abound \u2013 if you want to look for them.

            "date": "2024-09-23T14:07:47Z",
            "content": "Uncertainty before Labour\u2019s first budget since 2010 next month is weighing on the UK economy, according to two separate business surveys. The data company S&amp;P Global said UK private sector activity growth slowed for the second consecutive month in September, affecting the services and manufacturing industries. Some companies reported that clients were taking a \u201cwait-and-see approach\u201d to decision-making before the autumn budget, which is hitting investment plans, even as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, wants to encourage business investment to boost economic growth. The figures suggest that Labour\u2019s emphasis on its poor inheritance from the previous Conservative administration and the need for a tough budget on 30 October were weighing on the immediate outlook for many businesses. The S&amp;P survey found that the budget was \u201cby far the most cited concern among UK private sector firms\u201d. Export orders remained \u201crelatively subdued\u201d and total overseas sales rose only \u201cmarginally\u201d in September. The survey said: \u201cSome service providers noted higher demand from US clients, but manufacturers frequently suggested that weak EU sales had weighed on export orders.\u201d A separate survey of manufacturers by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) found that export order books in the three months to September were at their weakest since December 2020 \u2013 during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, and just before the UK signed the Brexit trade agreement. In its industrial trends report, which the CBI described as \u201cuniformly disappointing\u201d, total and export order books at manufacturers deteriorated in September. A net balance of -44% of manufacturers reported that their export order books were below normal this month, compared with a reading of -22% in August. Ben Jones, the CBI lead economist, said: \u201cThe survey highlights that the recovery of the UK economy seen over the first half of 2024 remains fragile, with uneven progress seen across different sectors, and businesses increasingly cautious ahead of the budget at the end of next month.\u201d However, despite concerns of tax hikes in the budget and slowing growth, the S&amp;P survey racked up its 11th consecutive month of improving activity across the services and manufacturing sectors, and companies said their outlook over the next year was for new orders to grow. Overall, the flash UK PMI composite output index dipped to 52.9, down from August\u2019s 53.8. A figure above 50 indicates growth. Inflation is expected to moderate after companies slowed their price rises this month. The average prices charged by private sector businesses rose at the slowest rate since February 2021. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: \u201cA slight cooling of output growth across manufacturing and services in September should not be seen as too concerning, as the survey data is still consistent with the economy growing at a rate approaching 0.3% in the third quarter, which is in line with the Bank of England\u2019s forecast. \u201cBusiness optimism has also risen, albeit with concerns about the impact of the [budget] jangling nerves somewhat, notably in the manufacturing sector. Investment plans in particular are reported to have been put on ice pending clarity on the new government\u2019s policies, especially towards taxation.\u201d The UK economy has outperformed the eurozone this month, helping the pound hit a two-year high against the euro. Sterling gained half a eurocent to \u20ac1.1967, its highest level since early August 2022. A downturn in Germany, where business activity fell at the quickest rate for seven months in September, ,has pulled the wider eurozone economy into a contraction. Business activity across the euro area has decreased so far in September, with the HCOB flash eurozone PMI index dropping to 48.9, an eight-month low, and below the 50-point mark showing stagnation. Hamburg Commercial Bank predicts Germany\u2019s economy will shrink by 0.2% in the July-September quarter. That would put the country into recession, as GDP fell by 0.1% in April-June."

            "date": "2024-09-11T12:41:20Z",
            "content": "The anticipated post-election bounceback in the UK economy failed to materialise as activity flatlined in July for a second month, according to the latest official data. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the pre-election stalling of activity in June was followed by another month in which gross domestic product remained unchanged. Although the economy grew by 0.5% in the three months to July, the weak performance of the economy during Labour\u2019s first weeks in power came as a shock to the City, which had been expecting growth of 0.2% on the month. The economy grew by 0.7% in the first three months of 2024, followed by a 0.6% expansion in the second quarter, but the latest ONS figures suggest the recovery from the mild recession in late 2023 has petered out. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: \u201cI am under no illusion about the scale of the challenge we face and I will be honest with the British people that change will not happen overnight. Two quarters of positive economic growth does not make up for 14 years of stagnation.\u201d There was better news for the chancellor from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which has revised up its growth forecasts for the UK after the unexpectedly strong performance of the economy in the first half of 2024. The OECD, made up of 38 rich-country members, said it expected the UK to grow by 1.1% this year and by 1.2% in 2025, compared with the 0.4% for 2024 and the 1% for 2025 that it had predicted in May. But while growth was picking up, the OECD said, the chancellor needed to look at tax reform as well as as increases in her forthcoming budget. \u201cThe UK faces a challenging economic environment of high interest rates and low growth limiting macroeconomic policy options,\u201d it said in its annual economic report. The second month of zero growth slightly pushed up market expectations that the Bank of England would cut interest rates for a second time in a row when policymakers meet on 19 September. Official borrowing costs currently stand at 5%. Ruth Gregory, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cFor now, we are sticking to our view that the Bank of England will keep interest rates unchanged in September before cutting rates again in November. But today\u2019s data has made an interest rate cut next Thursday a bit more likely.\u201d Of the three main sectors of the economy, only one \u2013 services \u2013 recorded any growth in July, expanding by 0.1%. Production, which includes manufacturing, contracted by 0.8%, while there was a 0.4% drop in construction output. Liz McKeown, the ONS director of economic statistics, said: \u201cJuly\u2019s monthly services growth was led by computer programmers and health, which recovered from strike action in June. These gains were partially offset by falls for advertising companies, architects and engineers. Manufacturing fell, overall, with a particularly poor month for car and machinery firms, while construction also declined.\u201d The ONS said in the three months to July the level of GDP was 1.1% higher than in the same three months of 2023. Before the release of the ONS figures, economists had thought the slowdown witnessed in June was temporary and caused by political uncertainty. Lindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said it was still possible the summer slowdown was a blip but said Reeves needed to be careful in her budget next month. \u201cGiven the mood music emanating from the government and the economic inheritance it has received from the Conservatives, the government needs to be careful not to overcorrect with its narrative around tax rises and the potential this has to put off investment,\u201d James said. Anna Leach, the chief economist at the Institute of Directors business lobby group, said: \u201cIt is important that the forthcoming budget delivers a strong and positive message on growth. To reinforce business confidence to grow and invest, businesses need a predictable and efficient tax system, and growth-supporting policies.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-29T16:00:36Z",
            "content": "After voting this month to require a hand count of paper ballots on election day, the Trump-aligned trio of Georgia state elections board members turned their attention back to one of their favorite topics: how to keep an eye on Fulton county. Georgia\u2019s most populous county is always on their mind. For people who still chant \u201cstop the steal\u201d almost four years after the 2020 election, Fulton county remains the problem. Earlier this year, the state board entered into a voluntary agreement with Fulton county to embed an external monitoring team into the election apparatus for the 2024 contest. The agreement came after the state board reprimanded the county for potentially double counting about 3,000 ballots during a recount of the 2020 election. The mistake did not \u2013 could not \u2013 change the election result which showed that Joe Biden had won the election. Nonetheless, the county swallowed hard and ate the rebuke. But the devil is in the details down in Georgia. Which monitoring team? Who gets to stand behind poll workers on election night looking for loose ballots and bad math? Last week, the state election board rejected the monitoring team the county had selected, instead preferring an option primarily including people tied to the stop-the-steal movement. State board members said they would send the chairman to the county to try to negotiate, but the terms of the agreement and the late date for adjustments leaves the state board little leverage. The Fulton county board of registration and elections had two proposals for monitoring teams before them in June. One proposal had Ryan Germany, a former staff attorney for Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, leading a team that included a monitor from the United States Election Assistance Commission, a former elections director from Augusta, the special master that had concluded the county double-counted ballots and the previous Republican chairman of the state board of elections itself. The proposal also engaged the Carter Center, an international election monitoring organization based in Atlanta. The team would review election security, the county\u2019s chain of custody procedures, poll worker training, storing ballots, advance voting and other processes. The other proposal, as presented by the state elections board member Dr Janice Johnston, included Salleigh Grubbs, the chairwoman of the Cobb county Republican party whose petition to permit elections directors to engage in a poorly defined investigation of discrepancies before certification, has been dubbed the Grubbs Rule and is now the subject of litigation. Others include Heather Honey, a conservative elections activist from Pennsylvania; Christine Propst, who has managed Republican poll watchers and Garland Favorito, an attorney and conspiracy theorist who has made unsubstantiated claims about counterfeit ballots used in 2020. Favorito is known for filing lawsuits to litigate the 2020 election results, one of which still remains active. Fulton county went with the first proposal. \u201cAlthough the state election board does not have the legal authority to require monitors, we agreed as part of that resolution, as part of that reprimand, to have monitors for the 2024 general election,\u201d said Nadine Williams, Fulton county\u2019s election director, to the Fulton county commission on 4 September. Williams cited the difference in potential cost as a factor driving the decision. She also said that Germany\u2019s team presented itself as non-partisan to the state election board, while the other team did not. In any case, Williams didn\u2019t want to try to make changes to the approved team with only weeks to go before the election. \u201cWe would hope that what is in the best interest of Fulton county is what\u2019s the best interest of the state,\u201d said the Fulton county commissioner, Khadijah Abdul-Rahman. \u201cBut I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t say that it disturbs me that we politicize everything when we are trying to do what is right.\u201d The county commission voted 5-2 to fund the Ryan Germany team. One of the two no votes was Bridget Thorne, a Republican election monitor who rose to prominence with the ascent of the stop-the-steal movement and maintained a secret Telegram channel for conservative elections activists. Thorne raised questions about the quality of the oversight by some of the proposed monitors, and suggested that the involvement of the Carter Center as an election monitor in Fulton county would raise questions about bias. \u201cI think that\u2019s why a lot of the people are kind of skeptical because it feels like we\u2019re going to have another rubber stamp,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not against monitors. I\u2019m just against, perhaps, just these type of monitors \u2026 if they\u2019re going to be hiring the ACLU and Common Cause people to come in, then that\u2019s one-sided, a left-leaning side.\u201d Meanwhile, the three Republican appointees to the state elections board whom Trump praised by name as \u201cpit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory\u201d rejected the county\u2019s monitoring team on Monday. An email campaign driven by the Constitution party of Georgia, citing Favorito\u2019s advocacy, sent a thousand messages to the board asking it to reject the Ryan Germany monitors. Johnston cited the emails as a reason for concern. She seemed to be unaware that the county had the right to reject her proposal outright when the board discussed it Monday. \u201cThere has been no mutually agreed upon monitoring team,\u201d she said. \u201cFulton county decided on its own to move on with the Ryan Germany team, which is disconcerting because I have received over 1,000 emails opposing the Ryan Germany team and the Carter Center \u2026 That team is not desirable or acceptable, certainly by me.\u201d She suggested that each board member should be allowed to appoint two members from her proposal, and that the state board name the leader of the monitoring team. \u201cIf they don\u2019t agree to it, we can consider other options.\u201d The state board\u2019s beleaguered chairman, John Fevrier, said he intended to have a meeting with Fulton county\u2019s board to reopen negotiations. But the Georgia attorney general, Chris Carr, reiterated to the state elections board that the agreement was voluntary, in an advisory letter sent 19 August. He also said that if the state tried to reopen the 2020 election on its own, or bucked the county board by refusing to agree to the monitors, it \u201cappears highly likely that no monitoring team will be engaged\u201d."

            "title": "Arizona elections error could affect eligibility of nearly 100,000 voters",
            "date": "2024-09-17T21:40:19Z",
            "content": "Arizona\u2019s top elections official said on Tuesday that a newly identified error in the state\u2019s voter registration process needs to be swiftly resolved, as early ballots are set to go out to some voters as soon as this week. Election staff in the Maricopa county recorder\u2019s office identified an issue last week, which concerns voters with old driver\u2019s licenses who may never have provided documentary proof of citizenship but were coded as having provided it and therefore were able to vote full ballots. The state has a bifurcated system in which voters who do not provide documentary proof of citizenship cannot vote in local or state elections, only federal ones. Because of the state\u2019s very close elections and status as a swing state, the issue affecting nearly 100,000 voters will probably be the subject of intense scrutiny and litigation in the coming weeks. Arizona has more than 4.1 million registered voters. Governor Katie Hobbs directed the motor vehicles division to fix the coding error, which the secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, said was already resolved going forward. It is not clear if any of these voters have unlawfully cast a ballot or if they have already provided proof of citizenship. People who register to vote check a box on registration forms, under penalty of perjury, declaring they are citizens. \u201cWe have no reason to believe that there are any significant numbers of individuals remaining on this list who are not eligible to vote in Arizona,\u201d Fontes said in a press conference on Tuesday. \u201cWe cannot confirm that at this moment, but we don\u2019t have any reason to believe that.\u201d The error, reported by Votebeat on Tuesday, relates to several quirks of Arizona governance. Since 1996, Arizona residents have been required to show proof of citizenship to get a regular driver\u2019s license. And since 2004, they have been required to show proof of citizenship to vote in state and local elections. State driver\u2019s licenses also do not expire until a driver is age 65, meaning some residents will have a valid license for decades before needing renewal. These factors play into the error. The issue has split the Republican recorder in the state\u2019s largest county, Maricopa, and the Democratic secretary of state. Recorder Stephen Richer is arguing that these voters should only be able to cast a federal-only ballot, while Fontes says the state should keep the status quo of allowing them to vote full ballots given how soon the election is. Fontes directed counties to allow these residents to cast full ballots this year. Arizona is home to a strong election denial movement, and the issue is likely to play into these narratives. Republicans have for months been stoking fears about non-citizens voting in the November election in Arizona and nationwide, despite a lack of evidence that non-citizens are voting in any meaningful numbers. Richer wrote on X that his office would be suing Fontes\u2019s office over this, saying because they disagree, the courts will provide \u201ca clear answer\u201d. Richer\u2019s office identified the issue, which affects all counties in the state. The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday afternoon, and in it, the recorder\u2019s office said it had discovered the issue by identifying a non-citizen who was erroneously registered to vote, though the person had not cast a ballot in the past. \u201cAll of these people have attested under penalty of law that they are U.S. citizens. And, in all likelihood, they [are] almost all U.S. Citizens,\u201d Richer wrote on X, adding that they had not provided proof. The group in question contains approximately 98,000 voters. Fontes said the \u201cplurality\u201d of these residents are Republican and between ages 45 and 60, receiving driver\u2019s licenses before 1996. \u201cIf you are on this list, rest assured you will be contacted soon by Arizona elections officials,\u201d Fontes said. But, he added, elections offices first want the courts to weigh in before reaching out to voters \u201cwilly-nilly\u201d. As described by Votebeat, the problem relates to people who \u201cfirst obtained their Arizona driver\u2019s license before October 1996 and then were issued a duplicate replacement before registering to vote sometime after 2004\u201d. Elections officials would look at voter registration forms to see when licenses were updated to see if the dates meant people had submitted the required proof of citizenship. For dates after October 1996, officials assumed paperwork was in order. But, unbeknown to elections officials, the motor vehicles division\u2019s system would update the license issuance date when people replaced or updated their licenses, making it look like the license was newer and would have included proof of citizenship. The error has occurred, seemingly unnoticed, since 2005, the lawsuit says."

            "content": "Guardian US is co-hosting an event on 12 September at 7.30pm PT with Bay Area public media outlet KQED and the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism focused on the impact artificial intelligence could have on elections and democracy. The panel will discuss worries over the role AI could play in this year\u2019s elections and beyond, including manipulated or deepfaked media and false information spread on platforms. These disruptions could increase as the November elections near. KQED\u2019s Rachael Myrow and the Guardian\u2019s Rachel Leingang will moderate the conversation with California state senator Scott Wiener, California Common Cause executive director Jonathan Mehta Stein, and Encode Justice founder Sneha Revanur. In an ongoing series, the Guardian has covered some of the threats AI poses on elections and the potential it has to disrupt or confuse the voting process \u2013 as well as the ways the mere threat of what AI could do might lead to voters doubting whether something is real or faked. AI-generated material has already shown up in US elections, starting with a robocall before the New Hampshire primaries where a faked voice of Joe Biden told people not to vote. The company that sent the call agreed to a $1m fine, while the person who orchestrated it faces criminal charges and a $6m fine. Elon Musk, the owner of social media platform X, has shared AI-generated content, including a video that faked Kamala Harris\u2019s voice and a photo of the vice-president in a communist uniform. The platform\u2019s AI chatbot, Grok, has spread false information about elections. As part of the Bots v Ballots series, the Guardian has detailed how AI\u2019s advancement outpaces attempts to regulate it, and what that means for voters, and investigated an AI-based tool that would allow people to file mass challenges to voters\u2019 eligibility, potentially preventing eligible people from casting ballots. The Guardian also created deepfake audio to show how easy it is to make and how hard it can be for people to distinguish, and talked to deepfake detection experts to understand what we should look for when analyzing a piece of media. And the Guardian reported on how a lawmaker used an AI chatbot to write a bill that regulates AI in elections."

            "date": "2024-09-20T12:00:12Z",
            "content": "One evening last month, a new Twitter account popped up purporting to represent the Georgia state board of elections. The account emerged at a curious moment. The five-person volunteer board was coming under increased scrutiny for pushing through new rules that could lead to confusion and, possibly, delays in certifying election results this fall. \u201cGreetings to all Georgia citizens from a member of the State Election Board!\u201d the account\u2019s first message said. \u201cThe State Election Board is committed to the General Assembly\u2019s mission of ensuring that elections in Georgia are free and fair, but also legal, uniform, orderly, honest, and trusted.\u201d The post was signed: \u201cThanks, Dr. Jan.\u201d The author was Janice Johnston, a member of the board who was appointed by the state Republican party in 2022. The next morning, she emailed her fellow board members and their staff and explained that she had taken it upon herself to create the Twitter account , as well as accounts on Facebook and Instagram. \u201cI thought it would be great to have a presence on social media that would facilitate our effort to communicate with the public,\u201d she wrote, in an email that has not previously been made public. \u201cAs we approach this election cycle, we have the opportunity to provide clear and accurate information to the public and demonstrate transparency.\u201d \u201cIf there is opposition to this, please let me know.\u201d John Fervier, the board\u2019s chair, responded shortly after, listing 10 bullet points explaining why he believed her actions were wrong and said that he had never been consulted. \u201cFor a social media site to be set up in the name of the Georgia State Election Board and the Chairman of the Board and the Executive Director to not know about it is astonishing to me and shows a serious disregard for our positions,\u201d he wrote. Fervier noted that the account had already spread false information, claiming that the election board oversees elections in Georgia. Each of the state\u2019s 159 counties runs its elections, which are overseen by the Georgia secretary of state, a statewide elected official. The board is charged with rule-making and has the power to investigate elections under state law. Johnston would later change the Twitter handle to make it clear she was only speaking on her own behalf. Her attempt to speak on behalf of the board came a little over a month after she and two other Republicans attempted to have a last-minute meeting without two other members \u2013 a move that may have violated the state\u2019s open-records law. It underscored how Johnston, a retired OB-GYN, has undergone a meteoric rise from being a citizen activist to one of the most powerful people on the state\u2019s board of elections. Johnston\u2019s influence over the board represents one of the biggest successes of the election-denial movement in the United States. Called to action by doubts about the 2020 election results, activists have thrown themselves into monitoring election offices and, in some cases, seeking positions of power as election administrators or election board members. The influence that Johnston now wields on a powerful board in a battleground state illustrates how far that strategy can go. Working with input from a network of activists who doubt the 2020 election across the state, Johnston has emerged as the leader of a three-member Republican bloc that has pushed through rules aimed at giving local election officials more power to hold up certification. The new rules allow any local election board member to conduct \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d and allow local election officials to request vast amounts of documentation and information before an election is certified. They also require election officials to explain and reconcile any discrepancy between the number of voters checked in and the number of ballots cast in a precinct before the vote is certified. There is considerable concern that these new rules could cause severe delays in the certification. \u201cJohnston seems to be the one really running Georgia\u2019s election board \u2013 she\u2019s secretly coordinating with Maga election deniers to change our election rules, giving them the power to veto our votes,\u201d said Lauren Groh-Wargo, the CEO of Fair Fight, a voting rights group. Recent reporting by the Guardian and Rolling Stone has shown Johnston in communication with a network of activists who have questioned the 2020 election and sought more power over election rules. \u201cBy giving extremists who are all in on Trump\u2019s 2020 election lies the power to block the certification of votes, she\u2019s laying the groundwork for election chaos in 2024.\u201d Johnston did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this story. A rise to power Johnston arrived at the state election board in early 2022 a relatively unknown figure. She had served as a poll worker, and after the 2020 election, she began regularly showing up at meetings of the Fulton county commission and its election board in Atlanta. She expressed concern over the county\u2019s contract with Happy Faces, a temp agency the county relied on to staff its election office and other government roles. There were false claims at the time that Stacey Abrams, the prominent Democratic gubernatorial candidate, had a financial stake in Happy Faces. Johnston repeated the false claim, saying: \u201cHappy Faces temp agency was and still is financially connected with Democrat political activist Stacey Abrams which according to Ms Abrams is technically legal, but in my opinion is unethical and unacceptable. It places our election process at risk of partisan and questionable hiring practices.\u201d She said the company had been \u201ccharged with double scanning thousands of ballots\u201d and \u201cinadequate management of voter rolls and voter residency requirements\u201d and was missing \u201cthousands of chain of custody documents of absentee ballots\u201d. The claim about missing chain-of-custody documents in Fulton county \u2013 circulating among those seeking to overturn the 2020 election at the time \u2013 has been debunked. Johnston then spoke at an August 2021 Fulton county commissioner\u2019s meeting, again suggesting that something had gone amiss in the November 2020 election. \u201cIs there any one of you who can positively state who falsified the tally sheets in the last November election audit? Was it a Happy Face\u2019s employees? Or was it Fulton county employees?\u201d she said. In October 2021, she suggested at another Fulton county commissioners meeting that an effort to hire poll technicians could be a plot to sway the election. \u201cIs this just a deceptive 11th-hour attempt to get outsiders in to our elections? Are poll technicians just repackaged Elections Group [an elections consultancy] operatives or ACLU activists? Or vote-at-home fake consultants?\u201d she said. Later, as a member of the state election board, she would continue to suggest that something had been amiss with the 2020 election (the results were affirmed by two different recounts). During a May meeting, she suggested that there could be more than 17,000 ballots missing in Fulton county because images of the ballots had not been provided. Charlene McGowan, a lawyer for the secretary of state\u2019s office, said unequivocally that there were no missing ballots: \u201cWe have the paper ballots. The paper ballots exist. There\u2019s no 17,000 missing ballots.\u201d Johnston was unpersuaded. She later filed a motion to have the secretary of state either deduct the 17,000 ballots \u2013 larger than Biden\u2019s margin in Georgia \u2013 from the certified vote total or investigate what happened. The motion failed. In 2021, Bob Ellis, a Republican on the Fulton county commission, nominated Johnston to serve on a taskforce to investigate elections in Fulton county. By that time, it was clear that Johnston was becoming a part of a community of activists closely monitoring elections. In December of 2021, the Fulton county Republican party featured Johnston in a photo with other activists raising a toast after filing challenges against voters. The challenges, which have been made easier by a series of legal changes Georgia Republicans passed, have not uncovered significant fraud. In January of 2022, the Georgia Republican party nominated Johnston to fill its seat on the Georgia election board. In a brief write-up covering her nomination, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution described her as a \u201cFulton elections critic\u201d and noted she had appeared regularly at county meetings \u201ccalling for the firing of the county\u2019s elections director, criticizing the job performance of temporary election workers and repeating unsubstantiated allegations of \u2018falsified tally sheets\u2019 during an audit\u201d. \u201cShe has served as a poll worker, poll watcher and absentee ballot monitor. She has been monitoring as a citizen the meetings of the state election board. She is retired now from her medical practice and has full time to devote to this important responsibility,\u201d David Shafer, then the chair of the Georgia Republican party, said when she was named to the board. Shafer now faces criminal charges as part of the racketeering case filed against Trump and allies in connection with efforts to overturn the election. During her first meeting as an election board member in March of 2022, Johnston introduced herself and explained her interest in elections. \u201cI started as a citizen who had some free time and wanted to volunteer. My interest and curiosity was working as a poll watcher, monitor, observer in absentee ballot processing. This experience was followed by participation in as many aspects of the election process as I could do from the grass-roots level,\u201d she said. \u201cThese interests then broadened to understanding the larger picture of elections processing, operations and conduct. Naturally, this led to a study of elections law, election systems and oversight of our elections.\u201d She noted she was a retired doctor, and went on to compare the administration of elections to practicing medicine, saying both required \u201cfair, ethical, legal and orderly conduct\u201d and treating everyone the same. She ended by previewing what her interests on the board would be: \u201cmaintenance for security and outside contracts, absentee voting safeguards security, and working toward the same requirements as in-person voting; vulnerable elector advocacy and protection; protection of election department from outside influences, money or manpower, partisan or private, direct or indirect; ballot security and voting systems\u201d. Helen Butler, a longtime voting activist in Georgia who regularly attends election board meetings in the state, said she had never heard of Johnston until after the 2020 election. \u201cShe tries to exert a lot of influence and, I think, with the two other Republicans on there, they\u2019ve become a mighty force,\u201d said Butler, the executive director of the Georgia Coalition for the People\u2019s Agenda, which regularly monitors election board meetings at the state level and across the state. \u201cThey\u2019re catering to the election deniers when in fact I really believe they just don\u2019t know the process, have never worked the process, and really don\u2019t care about the process.\u201d A network of election deniers As an election board member, Johnston is a connection between election deniers and a powerful government body. In November 2023, David Hancock, a member of the Gwinnett county election board, emailed Johnston to introduce himself. Hancock has posted on Facebook questioning the 2020 election and shared deceptive and debunked videos purporting to show fraud in Fulton county. \u201cI met you briefly a few months ago at one of your meetings), and I am working with some people that you know on various integrity projects,\u201d he wrote. In May, Johnston emailed Hancock to ask what materials he would need to certify an election, according to records obtained by Rolling Stone and American Doom. The email came as Johnston and other Republicans on the board were pushing new rules that allowed local officials to undertake an undefined \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d before certifying elections and allowed them unlimited access to documents. Johnston has also corresponded with Julie Adams and Michael Heekin, two Fulton county election commissioners who have refused to certify elections, according to Rolling Stone and American Doom. Adams is the regional coordinator for south-eastern states for the Election Integrity Network, a group focused on local election offices founded by Cleta Mitchell. She was represented by a pro-Trump group in a lawsuit seeking to give her more power over certification (the suit was recently dismissed on technical grounds). During her time on the Georgia state board of elections, Johnston has defended election conspiracists. Last year, for example, she objected to the state board\u2019s effort to force rightwing organization True the Vote to produce evidence to back up allegations of ballot fraud. \u201cAre we really going to put someone in jail because they did not respond to our questions? Is this designed to intimidate anyone who might consider filing an election complaint?\u201d she wrote to the other board members in November of last year in an email obtained by the watchdog group American Oversight and provided to the Guardian. She asked the board to record her dissenting vote. True the Vote eventually conceded that it did not have evidence to back up its claims. In January of this year, she emailed fellow board members saying she wanted to send a list of people suspected to be registered in more than one place to counties, according to more emails obtained by American Oversight and shared with the Guardian. She had obtained the list from an anonymous email account, Totes Legit Votes, which had been submitting complaints of illegally registered voters that had been debunked. Johnston said she had had the list authenticated by someone else \u2013 she did not say who \u2013 and wanted to ask the counties to investigate. Sara Tindall Ghazal, the Georgia Democratic party\u2019s appointee to the board, wrote back, objecting to contacting the counties: \u201cIf you have not yet consulted with the [secretary of state\u2019s] office on this issue, I believe that reaching out to counties directly is premature, particularly as any information from an anonymous third party is necessarily far less robust than data available to the secretary of state.\u201d \u2018A power grab\u2019 Despite her connections to activists in the state, it wasn\u2019t until recently that Johnston amassed influence on the board. Last year, she supported an unsuccessful effort to have the state board investigate Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, over his handling of the 2020 election. In February of this year, the board voted down her proposal to end no-excuse absentee voting in the state. In May, the state election board, including Johnston, also voted down a proposed rule that would have required local officials to reconcile minor discrepancies. \u201cJust last year, there were three lawyers on the five-member state election board, plus a retired judge as the chair. Board meetings and votes were generally by the book, and Dr Johnston was often outvoted by her fellow members,\u201d said Kristin Nabers, the state director of All Voting Is Local, a voting rights group. \u201cHowever, after a sustained pressure campaign, three of the board members were removed or quit, creating an opportunity for a power grab by election deniers.\u201d Johnston\u2019s influence started to grow after Republicans pressured Edward Lindsey, a Republican on the board, to resign. He did so in May, and was replaced by Janelle King, a conservative media personality and former deputy director of the Georgia Republican party. Josh McKoon, the chair of the Georgia Republican party, was clear about the significance of the new majority. \u201cI believe when we look back on Nov 5, 2024, we\u2019re going to say getting to that 3-2 election-integrity-minded majority on the state election board made sure that we had the level playing field to win this election,\u201d he said at the party\u2019s convention in May, according to the New York Times. The board\u2019s new majority, including Johnston, voted in August to ask the attorney general to reopen its inquiry into Fulton county\u2019s handling of the 2020 election (the attorney general declined). It also passed the new rules empowering local election officials to delay certification, and is poised to pass a measure on Friday requiring counties to hand-count ballots to check machine-vote totals. Johnston has received public praise from Donald Trump, who named her, King and Rick Jeffares \u2013 the other member of the GOP bloc \u2013 at a rally earlier this month. \u201cThey\u2019re on fire. They\u2019re doing a great job. Three members. Janice Johnston, Rick Jeffares and Janelle King. Three people, all pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory,\u201d he said during a rally in Atlanta in August. Johnston was the only one of the three in attendance. As the crowd roared, she stood up and waved. \u201cThank you,\u201d Trump said."

            "content": "Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland\u2019s stunning success in Germany\u2019s regional elections was described as \u201cbitter\u201d and \u201cworrying\u201d by chancellor Olaf Scholz. It is also concerning for the EU, which is grappling with existential problems, from Russia\u2019s grinding war on Ukraine to the climate crisis, while at the beginning of a new five-year cycle after the European elections earlier this summer. \u201cA dark day for Germany is a dark day for Europe,\u201d said French centrist MEP leader Val\u00e9rie Heyer. While the results in the eastern states of Thuringia and Saxony were not a surprise after the AfD\u2019s strong showing in June\u2019s European parliamentary vote, they confirm the steady rise of parties once considered beyond the pale. Radical and far-right parties are in government, or support the government, in Croatia, Finland, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Sweden. Austria could soon join that list with opinion polls showing the far-right Freedom party comfortably ahead before elections on 29 September. Meanwhile, France remains stuck in political paralysis, nearly two months after the president, Emmanuel Macron, called snap elections in response to the victory of the far-right National Rally in the European elections. Germany\u2019s coalition government \u2013 already seen as underpowered in Brussels \u2013 looks set to be even weaker after catastrophic results for all three governing parties in the two eastern states on Sunday. While recent election results in Poland and Spain show nationalist and far-right forces can be defeated, the overall picture looks gloomy for the EU. The weakness of France and Germany \u2013 the fabled motor driving European integration \u2013 in the face of the growing strength of the radical and far-right parties presents problems for the European project, which runs on compromise, respect for the rule of law and institutions. A fragmented EU with the radical right in the ascendancy will affect the most politically momentous decisions. Support for Ukraine will be threatened, especially as governments confront the costs of domestic rearmament, ongoing military support and Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction. The green agenda \u2013 entering a crucial implementation phase \u2013 will be at risk. Traditional centre-right parties, under pressure from the climate-sceptic far right, have shown they are ready to vote against ambitious policies to protect climate and nature. Governments will also be under more pressure to curb migration \u2013 the issue that most unites radical and far-right parties. The EU earlier this year agreed a sweeping package of laws to overhaul migration rules, including measures to speed up the return of people denied asylum, as well as share the cost of looking after people on the move. Hungary has denounced the pact, which is applicable from 2026, saying it will refuse any \u201cmandatory solidarity\u201d requirement to house asylum seekers, or make a financial or other contribution. If Hungary refuses, other governments could follow, pulling threads that unravel an untested system of EU cooperation. Added nerves over Europe\u2019s economic outlook and the soaring demands on the EU budget, which will have to be re-negotiated before 2028, the European project faces a rocky few years. So far EU officials have sounded confident that such parties can be mostly contained or will moderate their behaviour once in office: a dynamic aided by the fact they are divided over foreign policy and how to handle Brussels. Europe\u2019s radical and far-right forces are also splintered into three separate groups in the European parliament, blunting their effectiveness. \u201cThe centre is holding,\u201d European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said in June, once it became clear that pro-EU parties had won the most seats in the European parliament, although radical and far-right forces significantly increased their vote share. Sitting around the tables of EU decision-making can meanwhile draw anti-EU leaders into the traditional ways of deal-making \u2013 a \u201csocialisation effect [that] will eventually overrule their ideological baggage\u201d, as described by researchers at the Carnegie Europe thinktank in Brussels Giorgia Meloni is the textbook example. The Italian prime minister has mostly taken a pragmatic, non-confrontational approach to the EU, while curbing the rights of same-sex parents and seeking greater control over the media at home. In contrast, the EU\u2019s struggle to contain the nationalist right is exemplified by Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Hungary\u2019s long-serving leader is a serial disruptor of EU decisions, even if he usually \u2013 but not always \u2013 backs down. If the radical and far right continue to win elections, further boosted by a Donald Trump victory in November, containment becomes harder. The EU could see more Orb\u00e1n copycats, rather than those emulating Meloni\u2019s pragmatic strategy. \u201cThe challenge of the radical right needs to be addressed more seriously,\u201d Carnegie researchers have said."

            "content": "The Natural History Museum in London has announced a major programme of transformation it says will mark \u201ca step-change from being a catalogue of natural history to a catalyst for change\u201d in response to the climate emergency. The scheme to renovate the museum\u2019s celebrated Victorian building and develop a new research and storage facility will build on its aim to turn visitors into \u201cadvocates for the planet\u201d, it said on Thursday. Four existing galleries will be overhauled, including its enormously popular dinosaur gallery, while the museum plans to reopen two long-closed exhibition spaces, one of which, the Old General Herbarium, has not been accessible to the public since 1948. One of them will house a new permanent exhibition that the museum\u2019s director, Doug Gurr, said would include the most explicit climate messaging it had ever offered. The exhibition, Fixing Our Broken Planet, will have the express aim of \u201cnudging\u201d visitors to change their behaviour, he said. The new exhibition spaces will be freed up by the creation of a purpose-built storage, research and digitisation centre at Thames Valley Science Park near Reading, to which more than a third of the museum\u2019s enormous natural history collection will be moved from its \u201cunsuitable, unsustainable\u201d current home. The museum said this was \u201cso we can take better care of it and more easily share its data with scientists all over the world who are finding solutions to problems like climate change, biodiversity loss and food security.\u201d Until recently, Gurr told the Guardian, the museum had seen itself as a \u201cpassive observer \u2026 our job was to collect, to conserve, to research, to display\u201d. \u201c[Then] we stepped back a bit and said: \u2018Well, hang on, if your subject matter is planet Earth and it\u2019s under that much threat, you\u2019ve got to do something about it. If you want the sporting analogy: how do you get off the sidelines and get on the pitch?\u201d In 2020 the museum declared a planetary emergency, and Gurr said the redevelopment was part of its continuing response. \u201cThe best contribution we can make is to create what we call \u2018advocates for the planet\u2019. And what that really means is: how do you inspire people at scale to care about nature and to care enough to want to do something about it? \u201cOf course, we still want people to have a brilliant, fun family day out. But if you can come out of that being a little bit more interested in nature and a little bit more aware of some of the challenges, you\u2019re a bit more likely to want to do something about it.\u201d The overhaul of the South Kensington site is due to be completed in time for the museum\u2019s 150th anniversary in 2031. The bulk of the funding will come from the government, which has already committed more than \u00a3200m to the new collections and research centre, while a further \u00a3155m will fund a museum-led programme to digitise natural science collections in the UK. In addition, the museum announced plans to raise \u00a3150m from philanthropic and commercial sponsors. Gurr said the museum was happy to \u201ctalk to everybody\u201d about potential sources of sponsorship but would not accept donations from firms it saw as unacceptable partners based on their climate record. \u201cWe are very, very clear that when we talk to [a potential sponsor], we\u2019re going to look at the actual behaviour versus the statements,\u201d he said. Gurr said the museum had turned down \u201csignificant\u201d sums in the past \u201cwhere we just felt it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to accept at this point, because we\u2019re acutely aware that you can\u2019t go around asking people to change behaviour and save the planet if you\u2019re then hypocritical in some of the gifts you accept\u201d. He would not be drawn on the position taken by other institutions such as the Science Museum and the British Museum, both of which have highly controversial funding relationships with energy firms, but he said: \u201cIt is factual that we have not accepted any funding from fossil fuel companies.\u201d The museum recently redeveloped its outdoor space into two new gardens focusing on evolution and biodiversity, and Gurr said it hoped to expand its education programme, encouraging schools to exploit their own outdoor space and enhance their climate and nature teaching."

            "date": "2024-09-18T15:00:50Z",
            "content": "The Climate Change Authority determined that its incoming chairman, Matt Kean, did not have a conflict of interest despite taking a role at a climate advisory service \u2013 but he would need to make ongoing disclosures on relevant investments by the firm. Brad Archer, the authority\u2019s chief executive, said Kean \u2013 a former New South Wales treasurer and energy minister \u2013 had declared his position as a director of \u201cregulatory affairs and strategic partnerships\u201d at Wollemi Capital as \u201ca material personal interest\u201d, according to documents seen by Guardian Australia. \u201cNo conflict of interest currently exists between Mr Kean\u2019s outside interests and matters under consideration by the authority,\u201d Archer said in an accompanying letter sent to the office of opposition climate spokesman Ted O\u2019Brien, in response to a freedom of information request. Kean was asked to \u201cobtain further information on [Wollemi\u2019s] investments and provide it to the [authority\u2019s] secretariat\u201d. He should also disclose any individual investments \u201cthat may raise material conflict issues with authority work in accordance with standard meeting procedures\u201d, the document showed. The Albanese government\u2019s appointment of Kean in June sparked anger by some in the federal Coalition who saw the former deputy NSW Liberal leader as a turncoat. Others welcomed the choice of the architect of the state\u2019s renewable energy roadmap who had also advocated stronger climate change action for years. O\u2019Brien had said the climate and energy minister, Chris Bowen, had \u201cserious questions to answer\u201d after picking Kean. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cBowen needs to assure the Australian public that he did the appropriate checking of conflicts of interests before making this appointment,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, according to a Australian Financial Review report in August. Archer\u2019s comments were provided to O\u2019Brien\u2019s office after it sought an explanation of how the authority would handle Kean\u2019s role at Wollemi. That position commenced on 15 August, shortly after Kean took on the part-time role at the authority. Wollemi Capital was \u201ca global climate specialist investment firm\u201d and Kean\u2019s role was advisory and relationship management for which he would receive a salary and an equity stake in the company, the document said. \u201cHe will not have a decision-making role in relation to investments,\u201d it said. \u201cMr Kean\u2019s role will be to manage key stakeholder relationships, assist in identifying potential investors, and provide strategic advice within the firm, including in relation to potential investments.\u201d The \u201cintersection with authority business\u201d might come where Wollemi\u2019s interests were \u201cimpacted by advice, particularly as it relates to specific projects and technologies in which the firm invests\u201d, it said. A spokesperson for O\u2019Brien said \u201cgovernance matters and the Australian public deserve transparency on political appointments and actions,\u201d and that the government was \u201crunning a closed shop\u201d. \u201cIt has a track record of using non-disclosure agreements to hide from scrutiny, this is the same government who called for \u2018greater transparency\u2019 when in opposition,\u201d the spokesperson said. One of the documents noted some of the interests of other authority members that had been handled by the \u201cstandard procedures\u201d. These include those of Susie Smith, who was appointed by the Morrison government. Smith\u2019s interests include her role as principal of ESG &amp; Carbon Services, a consultancy. Patty Akopiantz, who was appointed at the same time as Kean, was co-founder of Assembly Climate Capital, a firm that says it is \u201ccreating answers to the generation-defining challenge of climate change\u201d. A spokesman for Bowen said the Climate Change Authority legislation envisages that its members would be across the relevant industries and sectors, and \u201cvitally ensures that these conflicts be transparently disclosed and appropriately managed\u201d. \u201cThis is reflected in the outgoing chair\u2019s [Grant King\u2019s] own external appointments being managed.\u201d He accused O\u2019Brien of making a political point rather than an \u201cearnest one of transparency\u201d."

            "content": "\u201cAll of that up there is Paradise,\u201d said Maria Moraes de Souza, gesturing to the string of villages among which she lives along one of the Amazon\u2019s most important waterways. But lately life in this supposedly Arcadian community has taken a toxic turn, as the River Madeira\u2019s waters have fallen to their lowest level since the 1960s and the skies overhead have filled with smoke from wildfires that are raging across Brazil. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it like this,\u201d said Souza, a 44-year-old subsistence farmer as her canoe glided through the murk towards her smog-shrouded hamlet, chaperoned by river dolphins whose aquatic home is growing smaller by the day. To reach Souza\u2019s wooden house in Para\u00edso Grande (Big Paradise) \u2013 a former rubber-tapping community near the port town of Humait\u00e1 \u2013 visitors must now scale a sun-scorched bluff that has been exposed by the plummeting waters. Vast, desert-like expanses of red-hot sand lie between some river-dwellers and the waters on which they depend for food, transport, education and work. Some of those beaches are hundreds of metres wide. \u201cIn the old days we used to understand the river\u2019s rise and fall \u2026 But lately man has started to affect nature to such an extent that we no longer know how things work,\u201d complained village leader Jos\u00e9 Francisco Vieira dos Santos, describing how the Amazon\u2019s annual rainy and dry seasons were being scrambled for reasons locals struggled to comprehend. \u201cEven the animals can feel the change,\u201d added Santos, 42. An Amazon catfish called the \u201cbod\u00f3\u201d used to lay its eggs in January. Now locals said it was happening as early as October. \u201cEverything has spun out of control,\u201d said Santos, who suspected construction of two hydroelectric dams further up the Madeira had added to the problem. Brazil\u2019s president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2013 whose administration has faced criticism over what some consider its sluggish response to the crisis \u2013 has painted his country\u2019s tribulations as part of a growing global emergency fuelled by climate change. \u201cHurricanes in the Caribbean, typhoons in Asia, drought and flooding in Africa, and torrential rain in Europe have left a trail of death and destruction,\u201d Lula told the UN general assembly last week, adding record floods, fires and drought in Brazil to that list. \u201cThe planet is no longer waiting to make the next generation pay the price and is fed up with climate deals that are not fulfilled.\u201d This year\u2019s drought \u2013 which authorities have called the most intense and widespread in Brazil\u2019s history \u2013 has brought misery to those who live along the Madeira, and other major Amazon waterways, including the Solim\u00f5es and the Negro. In Porto Velho, the largest city on the Madeira, passenger ships have found themselves high and dry because the waters are no longer deep enough to set sail. \u201cWe\u2019ve been stuck here for two weeks,\u201d said 50-year-old skipper Aurean Guimar\u00e3es, whose wooden ferry was stranded at a sun-baked port called Cai N\u2019 \u00e1gua (literally \u201cFall in the Water\u201d). \u201cThe river\u2019s so dry. There\u2019s so much sand. So many rocks \u2026 This is the first year we\u2019ve faced something like this,\u201d Guimar\u00e3es complained as the Madeira hit its lowest level since 1967. A banner hanging from the ferry\u2019s top deck declared: \u201cSOS\u201d. Indigenous communities have been hit particularly hard, with dozens of waterways drying up and dry vegetation supercharging wildfires that are ripping through their ancestral homes. Megaron Txucarram\u00e3e, an Indigenous leader from the Amazon state of Mato Grosso, said at least four territories in his region were going up in smoke, including in the Capoto Jarina area where a firefighter was killed in the blaze. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here since I was born and I\u2019ve never seen the forest burn like this \u2026 The forest is burning. Animals are burning. Trees are burning. Everything\u2019s burning,\u201d he said, lamenting how Indigenous sages who understood rain patterns were no longer alive to help out. \u201cThe firefighters aren\u2019t managing to put out these fires \u2013 only rain can do this.\u201d Erika Berenguer, a tropical forest expert from Oxford University who studies the Amazon, said she feared climate change meant that 2024\u2019s \u201capocalyptic scenario\u201d and \u201cdystopian sunsets\u201d might simply be a glimpse of an even bleaker future. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to think that this might be the best extreme drought that we have in the next 20 years. Because \u2026 in terms of the Amazon, we already have across the basin a 1.5-degree increase in temperature [since the 1970s]. Parts of the basin have a dry season that is one week longer [than before]. Parts of the basin have a dry season that is 34% drier,\u201d she said. Scientists attributed a 2023 drought that punished the Amazon to the natural climate phenomenon El Ni\u00f1o. But Berenguer noted how the strongest El Ni\u00f1o on record \u2013 1998\u2019s so-called \u201cKing Kong\u201d event \u2013 \u201cdidn\u2019t have the impacts that it\u2019s having now, either in terms of river drought or in terms of fires\u201d. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d she added. \u201cBecause from 1998 to 2024, the climate has already changed \u2026 Any extreme drought is already happening on top of [that]. So the impacts of drought are just exacerbated, and everything becomes really, really dry.\u201d Speaking at the UN, Lula admitted more needed to be done to tackle the fires and the drought and vowed to continue his crackdown on the environmental criminals growing rich from wrecking nature. In Para\u00edso Grande, where most residents declared themselves supporters of the politician they affectionately call \u201cPapai Lula\u201d (Daddy Lula), locals hope the president is true to his word and urged him to come to their rescue by sending humanitarian aid. \u201cThis heatwave is just crazy \u2013 and it\u2019s because of these folk who are just setting everything on fire,\u201d said Maria Delcy Barros de Moraes, blaming the farmers, ranchers and loggers whose use of fire to clear land has caused the wildfires to spread. \u201cWhy,\u201d she wondered, \u201cmust the righteous always pay for the sinners?\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-17T10:58:03Z",
            "content": "An unseasonably hot September sun blazed down from a cloudless blue sky as the UK\u2019s foreign secretary, David Lammy, took to the stage at the Temperate House at Kew Gardens, in west London. The choice of venue was no accident. It was here in July 2021 that the then US special presidential envoy John Kerry made his landmark speech comparing the climate crisis to the ravages of the second world war and vowed to forge a global agreement to \u201cnever again come so close to the edge of the abyss\u201d. That speech set the tone for a successful Cop26 summit in Glasgow three months later, a high water mark of global climate diplomacy and the last time the world looked unified in trying to contain the climate crisis within the relatively safe limit of a 1.5C temperature rise. The coalitions of countries that produced such progress have rapidly fallen apart since, and the 1.5C limit looks all but certain to be breached. Lammy\u2019s mission on Tuesday was to recreate that coalition and put the UK at the centre of global efforts to repair the damage done to the planet from greenhouse gas emissions and the destruction of the natural world. He vowed that tackling the climate and nature crises would be \u201ccentral to all the Foreign Office does\u201d. \u201c[These crises are] not some discrete policy area, divorced from geopolitics, conflict and insecurity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe threat may not feel as urgent as a terrorist or an imperialist autocrat. But it is more fundamental. It is systemic, pervasive and accelerating towards us.\u201d Like Kerry, Lammy presented the climate crisis as the existential threat of our time. Citing recent extreme weather, he warned: \u201cThese are not random events delivered from the heavens. They are failures of politics, of regulation and of international cooperation. These failures pour fuel into existing conflicts and regional rivalries, driving extremism and forced displacement. And it would be a further failure of imagination to hope that they will stay far from our shores.\u201d Also on Tuesday, the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, was addressing a conference of experts on the other side of London, arguing that economic renewal depended on resetting the power sector on a low-carbon path and generating green growth. He told the Guardian: \u201cThis is about the security of the British people. There can be no climate security for future generations unless we take international climate leadership now.\u201d And over at the Natural History Museum on Monday night, the environment secretary, Steve Reed, stood under the skeleton of a blue whale, declaring: \u201cNature and climate change are inter-related and integral to security and economic stability. The UK is back on the international stage on nature.\u201d The message could not be clearer: this government wants to tackle the climate and ecological crises head-on, reinvigorate green diplomacy and forge a global coalition for action before it is too late. The contrast with the previous government could scarcely be greater. Sunak skipped key international meetings, axed the post of climate envoy, made a U-turn on green policy and waged a \u201cculture war\u201d on the climate. Labour will not only reappoint a climate envoy, but double up, installing for the first time a nature envoy to coordinate with governments around the world on environmental protections. The diplomatic charm offensive has already begun \u2013 Miliband hosted the president of the next UN climate summit, Cop29, in London in July, and visited Brazil, host of next year\u2019s Cop30 summit, last month. Reed invited the president of the UN biodiversity summit, Colombia\u2019s Susana Muhamad, to London, and next year the UK will hold a global conference on energy security. Tone is important in international diplomacy, and Labour\u2019s stance impressed developing country observers. Harjeet Singh, global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, predicts vulnerable nations will respond positively. \u201cBuilding on its long history of supporting developing nations, the UK must deepen its commitment to helping them build resilience and tackle the harsh realities of climate change, paving the way for true global climate justice. The UK should align itself with vulnerable island nations like Vanuatu and Tuvalu, as well as fossil fuel dependent countries like Colombia, in their call for international cooperation on a just transition [away from coal, oil and gas].\u201d Mohamed Adow, the director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: \u201cWhat we need is for a country like the UK to really push for greater urgency, to show the energy transition can and must happen much faster and that support for the victims of climate change can\u2019t be ignored. If the UK can do that it will go a long way to earning the admiration and respect of people around the world.\u201d The UK could also fill a vacuum in climate leadership among major developed nations, with countries such as France and Germany distracted by domestic political upheavals. Paul Bledsoe, a lecturer at American University in Washington and a former White House climate official, said: \u201cFar more aggressive UK climate leadership under the new Labour government will have a tremendously positive influence globally, and will specifically be crucial to emboldening US policy should Kamala Harris be elected this November.\u201d But for all the enthusiasm that has greeted the change of government, at home and overseas Labour will have to do more than make stirring speeches and hold cosy meetings with allies to make a real impression. Tough decisions must be made, and soon. First, on the nature crisis, campaigners have said that more muscle is needed at home as well as abroad. Second, how far will the UK cut its emissions by 2035? Given that the UK is off track to meet its current 2030 emissions-cutting target, setting one that is more stringent but still credible will require a cross-government effort. Third, the pressing question of climate finance. Miliband has pledged to honour the UK\u2019s current commitment of \u00a311.6bn in climate finance by 2026, but many multiples of that will be needed, at a time when the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is cutting back across government. Fourth, the future of oil and gas. Labour has pledged to halt new licences, but campaigners would like to see more, including more detail on how to make the transition just. Robbie MacPherson, a Churchill fellow, is urging Miliband to join the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, a network of countries that are ending fossil fuel exploration and exploitation. \u201cThat would mark a positive step change in the UK\u2019s global standing.\u201d Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics at Greenpeace UK, says there are other major decisions the UK could make quickly that would be \u201crelatively easy wins\u201d, such as leading negotiations over a new global treaty to cut plastic pollution, ratifying the global oceans treaty and pushing to curb deep sea mining. \u201cMajor global summits in the autumn will be the first true testing ground of whether the Labour government can re-establish the UK as a progressive actor on the world stage \u2026 The key to success lies in ministers\u2019 willingness to stand up to polluting industries while showing solidarity with key allies especially in the global south,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Labour government has already started to set the record straight through its bold policy to end new oil and gas licences. It must now build on this at Cop29 to push for more taxes on oil and gas giants to support climate-impacted communities at home and abroad and advance a global fossil fuel phase-out.\u201d How Labour responds to these multiple challenges will determine whether the UK\u2019s return to the world stage on ecological diplomacy marks a true new beginning or another false start. As Lammy left the stage, the sun was still shining, but in the gardens leaves were starting to fall."

But her advice appeared to make little impact on Johnson\u2019s Tory successors, especially when as prime minister Rishi Sunak dismayed allied governments and exasperated campaigners by drastically dialling down the UK\u2019s global role at climate talks. In her new role, she will have the backing of the foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, in making the UK\u2019s case for concerted climate action before it is too late. Known for her forthright manner and striking turn of phrase \u2013 she memorably told the Guardian in the lead-up to Cop26 that the UK\u2019s seemingly haphazard approach was \u201clike dad-dancing \u2013 it\u2019s not that they\u2019re evil, just very uncoordinated\u201d \u2013 Kyte has been a familiar figure at climate meetings for more than a decade. Most recently, she was professor of politics at the Blavatnik school of government, part of Oxford University. Before that, she was dean of the Fletcher school at the prestigious Tufts University in the US. She graduated in history and politics from the University of London. After leaving her role as the most senior official on climate at the World Bank in 2015, she served as special representative on sustainable energy to Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, and was chief executive of the Sustainable Energy for All initiative, which aims to help the more than 1 billion people without access to electricity. She also sits on several boards and committees, including the voluntary carbon markets integrity initiative, and is an expert on reform of the development banks. In fact, according to Tom Burke, co-founder of the environmental thinktank E3G, her global recognition in climate circles could prove a source of tension with her new employers. \u201cIt\u2019s an odd appointment, as she has a higher profile and a wider network internationally than either of the sponsoring secretaries of state [Lammy and Miliband],\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s puzzling.\u201d But other climate experts and campaigners contacted by the Guardian were enthusiastic about the appointment. Prof Nicholas Stern, the economist, said: \u201cRachel Kyte is one of the truly outstanding figures in public policy on climate and energy. As well as a very clear and creative analytical mind, she has had tremendous experience in senior positions in the World Bank, in the UN, in academic life and in international negotiations. This is excellent news for the UK and the world.\u201d Areeba Hamid, co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cRachel Kyte looks to be an excellent choice as climate envoy but she has her work cut out. Her background working in climate finance will be crucial to ensure the UK is a leading voice in calling for an improved financial package, paid for by fossil fuel companies, for countries that are struggling to keep their heads above the rising tide of climate impacts. She will need true grit to keep driving for a phase-out of fossil fuels, while resisting the siren calls of petro-states, industry lobbyists and the \u2018carbon offsets\u2019 sector. But it is vital she has the full backing of the cabinet and diplomats so she can go about her work with authority and re-establish the UK\u2019s tarnished reputation as a climate leader on the world stage.\u201d In recognition of her work, Kyte was made a companion of St Michael and St George, one of the UK\u2019s top honours, in 2020."

In a speech to the UN general assembly on Wednesday, the Ukrainian leader said he had received information that Russia was gathering intelligence on Ukrainian nuclear power plants in preparation for a potential strike. \u201cAny missile or drone strike, any critical incident in the energy system could lead to a nuclear disaster \u2026 a day like that must never come,\u201d Zelenskyy said in an address in the general assembly hall. \u201cAnd Moscow needs to understand this, and this depends in part on your determination to put pressure on the aggressor.\u201d He added: \u201cThese are nuclear power plants, they must be safe.\u201d Zelenskyy also said that the war in Ukraine could threaten the region with instability and the potential for a nuclear catastrophe if Russia went forward with the attacks. \u201cIf, God forbid, Russia causes a nuclear disaster at one of our nuclear power plants, the radiation will not respect state borders,\u201d he said, comparing the consequences to the Chernobyl nuclear accident of 1986. \u201cAnd unfortunately, various nations could feel that devastating effects.\u201d Zelenskyy last month accused Russian forces of starting a fire on the site of the giant Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, with its six Soviet-built reactors, making it Europe\u2019s largest. Russia captured the nuclear plant soon after its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and the plant has come under repeated attacks that both sides have accused each other of carrying out. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly voiced concerns over the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, calling for \u201cmaximum restraint from all sides\u201d. As Zelenskyy was speaking in New York, Putin addressed Russia\u2019s powerful security council on Wednesday, making his strongest warning yet to the west against allowing Ukraine to launch deep strikes into Russian territory using long-range western missiles. Putin said Russia would consider using nuclear weapons if Moscow gets \u201creliable information about start of mass cross-border attack by air from strategic and tactical aviation, cruise missiles, drones and hypersonic weapons\u201d. The Russian leader added that proposals had been made to change Russia\u2019s nuclear doctrine, and said he would like to underscore one of the proposed key changes. \u201cIt is proposed that aggression against Russia by any non-nuclear state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear state, be considered as their joint attack on the Russian Federation,\u201d Putin said, in a thinly veiled threat to the west as foreign leaders continue to mull whether to allow Ukraine to use their long-range weapons. Putin frequently invoked Moscow\u2019s nuclear arsenal, the world\u2019s biggest, in the early days of its invasion of Ukraine, repeatedly pledging to use all means necessary to defend Russia. He later seemed to moderate his rhetoric, but officials close to the Russian president have recently warned Nato countries they risk provoking nuclear war if they were to give the green light for Ukraine to use long-range weapons. Earlier this month, Putin said the west would be directly fighting with Russia if it gave such permission to Ukraine \u2013 and that Russia would be forced to make \u201cappropriate decisions\u201d, without spelling out what those measures could be. Zelenskyy is expected to travel to Washington to present his \u201cvictory plan\u201d to Joe Biden at the White House on Thursday. The plan is a roadmap for Ukraine to end the war on its own terms, and is understood to include significant requests from the US and its allies for additional arms and economic and political support for Ukraine in the long term. The Ukrainian president is expected to meet with Kamala Harris, who is running neck and neck with Donald Trump in the US presidential election. The Republican nominee is not expected to meet with Zelenskyy during the trip, and has threatened to severely cut aid to Ukraine if elected. In campaign rallies this week, Trump reiterated that he would \u201cget out of Ukraine\u201d if elected president. In his speech, Zelenskyy said Ukraine\u2019s peace plan must be supported by world leaders, and that alternative initiatives to hold talks with Putin would simply aid the Russian president. Zelenskyy in particular targeted a joint proposal by China and Brazil, who have proposed a six-point peace plan for the Ukraine war without Kyiv\u2019s backing. \u201cIf someone in the world seeks alternatives \u2026 it likely means they themselves want to do a part of what Putin is doing \u2026 the question arises: what is the true interest?\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cEveryone must understand. You will not boost your power at Ukraine\u2019s expense.\u201d Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Brazil\u2019s president, had spoken of the plan earlier on Wednesday and Zelenskyy\u2019s remarks appeared targeted at him. \u201cMaybe somebody wants a Nobel prize for their political biography for a frozen truce instead of real peace, but the only prizes Putin will give you in return are more suffering and disasters,\u201d Zelenskyy said. In his speech, Zelensky also criticised the UN security council, saying it was \u201cimpossible to truly and fairly resolve matters of war and peace, because too much depends in the security council on the veto power\u201d. Russia is one of five permanent members of the security council and it exercises a veto power over any decisions taken by the body. Without revealing additional details about the plan, which has been kept largely secret, Zelenskyy indicated it would not be adopted directly through the UN. \u201cWhen the aggressor exercises veto power, the UN is powerless to stop the war,\u201d said Zelenskyy. \u201cBut the peace formula \u2026 there is no veto power in it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s the best opportunity for peace.\u201d Russian troops are threatening the Ukrainian road-and-rail hub of Pokrovsk in an onslaught that western officials say are leading to the killing of 1,000 Russian soldiers each day. A Russian-guided bomb strike on Ukraine\u2019s eastern city of Kramatorsk on Wednesday killed at least two people and injured 12 more, including three children, according to the Donetsk region governor, Vadym Filashkin."

            "content": "Western leaders should not be intimidated by Kremlin threats of nuclear escalation, the head of the CIA said on Saturday, amid a debate over whether Anglo-French Storm Shadow missiles should be used inside Russia. Bill Burns, on a visit to London alongside the head of MI6, said the US had brushed off a previous Russian nuclear scare in autumn 2022, demonstrating that threats from Moscow should not always be taken literally. \u201cPutin\u2019s a bully. He\u2019s going to continue to sabre rattle from time to time,\u201d Burns said. \u201cWe cannot afford to be intimidated by that sabre rattling \u2026 we got to be mindful of it. The US has provided enormous support for Ukraine, and I\u2019m sure the president will consider other ways in which we can support them.\u201d The CIA director also said the US was working very hard on fresh proposals for a ceasefire in Gaza with new \u201ctexts and creative formulas\u201d. A new plan, being devised with the help of mediators from Qatar and Egypt, would emerge, he hoped, \u201cin the next several days\u201d. However, it was unclear, Burns added, whether Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and the Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar were willing to strike a deal. It was a question of political will, he said: \u201cWhether or not leaders on both sides recognise that enough is enough and that the time has come to finally make some hard choices.\u201d Israel had succeeded in \u201cseverely degrading\u201d Hamas\u2019s military capabilities over the past 11 months, Burns said, but had not eliminated the movement in a war that had created a severe humanitarian crisis. \u201cIt is also a movement and an idea,\u201d the spy chief said, and you could only \u201ckill an idea with a better idea\u201d, meaning there needed to be some long-term hope for Palestinians. On Ukraine, the veteran spy chief was asked whether there was too much nervousness in Washington and other western capitals about the risk of escalating the war by giving permission for Storm Shadow, a missile with a range of at least 190 miles, to be used inside Russia. \u201cNone of us should take lightly the risks of escalation,\u201d Burns told an audience at a Financial Times event in London \u2013 and said there had actually been a belief within the CIA that Russia might use tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine in the first year of the war. \u201cThere was a moment in the fall [autumn] of 2022 when I think there was a genuine risk of potential use of tactical nuclear weapons,\u201d by Russia in Ukraine, Burns said, but he believed such concerns should not be taken too seriously. \u201cI never thought \u2026 we should be unnecessarily intimidated by that,\u201d he added. At the time, Russian troops had been pushed back in northern Ukraine and had abandoned Kherson in the south, prompting a belief that Russia might seek to use a nuclear weapon if a rout developed. In any event, the frontline stabilised shortly afterwards. Burns said that Joe Biden, the US president, had sent him to pass on a direct warning to Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Russian foreign intelligence service, at a meeting in Turkey in November 2022 \u201cto make very clear what the consequences of that kind of escalation would be\u201d \u2013 and that a similar approach was in place today. So far, the White House has been notably hesitant about allowing the use of Storm Shadow and other long-range missiles inside Russia, such as the US-made Atacms, despite repeated pleas from Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, including one made on Friday. Burns voiced concern that Iran was considering whether to supply ballistic missiles to Russia, but would not confirm whether the CIA believed it had done so. It would be a \u201cdramatic escalation\u201d of the relationship between the two countries; Tehran so far has supplied only less effective drones for Russia to use in Ukraine. Burns and his British counterpart, the MI6 chief, Sir Richard Moore, had never appeared in public together before the surprise appearance at the event at London\u2019s Kenwood House in Hampstead. Tight security meant that audience members were told only 15 minutes in advance who would be appearing. Moore said there were concerns that Russian spies were becoming increasingly reckless in the UK, Europe and elsewhere as the war in Ukraine continues. \u201cI think Russian intelligence services have gone a bit feral, frankly,\u201d the British spy chief said, as shown by a spate of arson attacks in the UK and elsewhere in Europe."

Both support the current building of Hinkley Point C in Somerset, the planned Sizewell C station in Suffolk, an unspecified number of small modular reactors all over Britain as well as the far-off dream of nuclear fusion. However, few scientists serious about the threat of the climate crisis believe new nuclear power stations are part of the solution in reducing carbon output. Building them is too slow and costly, while solar and wind are quicker and cheaper in making a dent in fossil fuel consumption and eliminating it. While supporting nuclear expansion seems to be politically expedient, the reality on the ground appears to be different. As the 2024 World Nuclear Status report published this month points out, if Britain gets anywhere near its plan to double onshore wind, triple solar power and quadruple offshore wind by 2030, it will be producing more electricity from these sources than the country consumes. The experts also say if Rolls-Royce\u2019s \u201cheroic assumption\u201d of the cost of electricity from small modular reactors was correct, any planned construction of large stations would immediately be abandoned."

This, in turn, threatens one of the most promising solutions to the climate crisis: solar farms. In the last year, the number of hailstorms in Europe exceeded 10,000 and the size of large hailstones reported from Italy and Germany increased to 10cm (4in) \u2013 enough to dent a car, smash greenhouses and break a solar panel. The frequency of storms and the size of the hail is increasing. In Texas, where hailstones come even bigger, baseball-sized holes have been knocked in solar panels, causing large-scale damage. Maintenance of solar panels is minimal, as they have no moving parts, but the threat of hail may cause that to change. Insurance companies are prepared to offer hail cover to solar farms, but only on condition that the panels have a mechanism that can turn them at least 70 degrees to the ground so hail will only strike a glancing blow. Some newer farms that had already planned a system to turn the panels towards the sun as the day progresses are modifying their operation so panels can be rendered almost upright if a hail warning is issued."

The comments marked Russia\u2019s strongest warning yet to the west against allowing Ukraine to launch deep strikes into Russian territory using long-range western missiles.

Putin also warned that a nuclear power supporting another country\u2019s attack on Russia would be considered a participant in aggression, issuing a thinly veiled threat to the west as foreign leaders continue to mull whether to allow Ukraine to use long-range weapons. Putin said the clarifications were carefully calibrated and commensurate with the modern military threats facing Russia. \u201cWe see the modern military and political situation is dynamically changing and we must take this into consideration. Including the emergence of new sources of military threats and risks for Russia and our allies,\u201d he said. Zelenskyy\u2019s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, dismissed the new nuclear doctrine, saying: \u201cRussia no longer has any instruments to intimidate the world apart from nuclear blackmail. These instruments will not work.\u201d Several influential foreign policy hawks have previously pressed Putin to adopt a more assertive nuclear posture towards the west, lowering its threshold for using nuclear weapons in order to deter the west against providing more direct military support to Ukraine.

            "content": "Youth unemployment has risen to a post-pandemic high as unions warned that \u201cyoung people\u2019s futures are on the line\u201d amid a widespread struggle to find a job. Official figures showed youth employment has reached its highest level in more than three years. There were 597,000 young people aged 16 to 24 who were unemployed in May to July 2024, an increase of 51,000 from the previous year, according to figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The unemployment rate for 18- to 24-year-olds increased to 13.3%, up from 12.3% in January to March. The rate for 16- to 24-year-olds was even higher, at 14.2%. The TUC\u2019s general secretary, Paul Nowak, described the increase as a \u201ctoxic Tory legacy\u201d that illustrated how young people were being neglected by the government and employers. University graduates have described the process of finding a first job as \u201chostile and impersonal\u201d, leading many to work for minimum wage instead. Figures from the Office for National Statistics have showed a trend for employers to hire older workers in recent years. Between August 2023 and August 2024, there was a decrease of 127,000 payrolled employees aged under 25. During the same period, payrolled employees aged 35 to 49 increased by 114,000. The average unemployment rate in the three months to July was 4.1%. Nowak said: \u201cWorking people are still facing major problems left behind by the Conservatives. Vacancies have been falling for more than two years. Millions of workers are in insecure jobs and without proper employment rights. And young people\u2019s futures are on the line as youth unemployment rises. \u201cMost employers support the new government\u2019s plans to make work pay and strengthen workers\u2019 rights. It\u2019s time to move on from the low-pay, low-rights approach that has failed so many people so badly.\u201d A report by the House of Commons library said that youth unemployment was \u201cstill at a historically low level\u201d. Youth unemployment fell to 406,000 in May to July 2022, which was the lowest recorded level since records began in 1992. Since then it has risen by almost 50%. James Cockett, a senior labour market economist for the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said it was possible that plans to improve rights for younger workers, which includes an increase in the minimum wage to the standard rate, was discouraging companies from hiring. \u201cIt\u2019s important proposed changes to strengthen employment rights are subject to proper consultation, to ensure they don\u2019t add to the cost or risk employers face in employing staff as this could deter firms from recruiting young people who typically require more development.\u201d He said younger people also needed more support. \u201cThere is a need for the government to go further than its proposed youth guarantee for 18 to 21-year-olds. \u201cThere is a strong case for the introduction of an apprenticeship guarantee to provide a guaranteed level 2 or 3 apprenticeship for 16- to 24-year-olds. This would help address the collapse in apprenticeship provision among young people in recent years and provide more routes into work.\u201d The government has said it wants to improve the number of people in work by increasing the employment rate to 80%, up from 74.8%. Ben Harrison, the director of the Work Foundation thinktank at Lancaster University, said this was likely to be difficult to achieve while 2.79 million working-age people \u201cremain sidelined from the workforce due to long-term sickness\u201d. Harrison said the government\u2019s plans \u201crequire a rewiring of the welfare offer by overhauling the punitive culture of Jobcentres, improving public services and creating new relationships with local leaders to open up opportunities\u201d."

            "date": "2024-09-19T02:47:30Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s economy added more jobs than expected in August as the unemployment rate remained steady, making a Reserve Bank interest rate cut less likely in the short term. The jobless rate in August was 4.2%, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on Thursday. Economists had it expected it to remain in line with the 4.2% in July. Employers added a net 47,500 jobs last month compared with the 26,000 economists had predicted. Of the added jobs, more than 50,000 were part time, with 3,100 full-time roles shed. Signs of strength in the job market included a 0.4% increase in the number of hours worked to 1.962bn, said Kate Lamb, head of labour statistics at the ABS. \u201cThe proportion of people working reduced hours because they were sick continues to be above pre-pandemic levels,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cHowever, the proportion of people working less hours than usual due to economic reasons, such as no work or less work available, is below pre-pandemic levels, which points to continued relative tightness in the labour market.\u201d The participation rate, one measure of the share of the population in work or looking for employment, remained at its record level of 67.1%. \u201cThe economy is soft and people are under pressure and that\u2019s why we are pleased to see we are still creating jobs and opportunities for more Australians than ever,\u201d the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said in a statement. The Albanese government revised its previous estimates that it was close to ticking past the mark of 1m new jobs since taking office in May 2022. It now puts the gain at almost 978,000. The labour market will be a key gauge of whether the economy remains aloft after 13 RBA interest rate hikes or suffers a hard stall, as happened after previous bursts of inflation. The central bank last week indicated that it viewed current conditions to be \u201cabove\u201d full employment with jobless rate needing to rise to ensure inflation\u2019s retreat continued. However, most rich nations are now cutting interest rates, including the US Federal Reserve, which made its first reduction in four years on Wednesday. Weakening employment figures in Australia would be one signal for the RBA to sharpen its rate cut axe. Prior to Thursday\u2019s figures, financial markets were betting the RBA would leave its cash rate unchanged at its two-day board meeting next week on Monday and Tuesday. Investors were only expecting the first 25 basis point cut to 4.1% by February, according to the ASX. After the release of the jobs data, the Australian dollar remained steady near 67.5 US cents, while the ASX200 benchmark share index was also little moved to be flat for the day. Brendan Rynne, KPMG\u2019s chief economist, said the latest data \u201conce again shows the resilience of the Australian labour market despite a slowing economy\u201d. \u201cNext week\u2019s monthly CPI data should show inflation falling, but it is still KPMG\u2019s expectation that the RBA won\u2019t start to cut the cash rate until early next year, when inflation is expected to be safely within the [2%-3%] target band,\u201d Rynne said. Separately, the latest ACCI/Westpac business survey, released on Thursday, found \u201ca net 13.1% of respondents indicated that labour was more \u2018difficult to find\u2019 in the September quarter, a modest increase from the net 11.7% in Q2\u201d. Among the major states, New South Wales\u2019s jobless rate crept up to 4.1% from 4.0% in July. Queensland, which goes to the polls next month, saw its unemployment rate ease 0.1 percentage points to 4.2%, with Victoria posting a similar improvement to 4.5%. Western Australia, South Australia and the ACT all posted jobless rates of 3.9% in August, the lowest in the nation. Australia\u2019s jobless rate compares with the UK\u2019s 4.1% and New Zealand\u2019s at 4.6%, both in June. The European Union\u2019s was a hefty 6.4% (in July) and Canada\u2019s 6.4% (in August), according to The Economist."

            "content": "US employers added 142,000 jobs last month, the labor department announced on Friday, in one of the year\u2019s most closely watched economic news releases. The release comes as the US Federal Reserve prepares to cut interest rates for the first time since March 2020, and November\u2019s election puts a spotlight on the state of the US economy. The reading for August was shy of the average forecast increase of 163,000 jobs by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The labor department also cut its figures for the number of new hires for June and July by a combined 86,000 jobs, a further sign that the remarkable post-pandemic hiring boom is weakening. The headline unemployment rate also decreased from 4.3% to 4.2%, in line with expectations. US stock markets fell as investors worried about a weakening economy and fears that the artificial intelligence boom may prove less lucrative than first thought. The tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 2.6% with the broader S&amp;P 500 down 1.7% and Dow Jones industrial average down 1%. Over five trading sessions, the S&amp;P suffered its worst week since 2023. The Nasdaq endured its worst week since 2022. Tech companies including Nvidia, the chips giant, and Alphabet, owner of Google and YouTube, led Friday\u2019s sell-off. The economy is ranked as one of the most important issues heading into November\u2019s presidential election, amid significant unease over its strength. Donald Trump led Kamala Harris by 3% in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll on the candidates\u2019 approaches to the economy and employment. Last month, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics made a significant revision, lowering the number of job created in the 12 months to March by 818,000, or 0.5%, the largest revision since 2009. The revision tapered job increase reports to about 174,000 jobs a month added, compared with the previously reported rate of about 242,000 jobs a month. The revision came amid signs that the jobs market is weakening. On Wednesday the labor department reported that the number of job openings has fallen to its lowest level in three and a half years. The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, recently signaled plans to reduce interest rates when the central bank holds its next meeting on 17 and 18 September, declaring that \u201cthe time has come\u201d for the Fed to act. \u201cThe direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,\u201d he said. Two years ago, when inflation was soaring during the pandemic, policymakers at the Fed scrambled to cool the US economy by raising rates to a two-decade high. Now that price growth is falling back \u2013 it rose at an annual rate of 2.9% in July, having faded from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 \u2013 they are preparing to cut rates, but have yet to do so. Officials hope to guide the US to a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d, whereby inflation is normalized, and recession avoided. The Fed\u2019s target for inflation is 2%. In recent months, critics of the Fed have accused the central bank of sitting on its hands and derailing the US economy, amid unease over its direction. An unexpectedly weak jobs report for July, which came a day after the Fed again chose to hold rates steady, sparked a fleeting global sell-off. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the report showed \u201cthe labor market is clearly experiencing a marked slowdown\u201d but \u201coverall, still consistent with an economy experiencing a soft landing rather than plummeting into recession\u201d."

Marshall, the hedge fund tycoon who already owns the UnHerd website, is also in the running to buy The Daily and Sunday Telegraph with the second round of bids by prospective buyers due by 27 September. The tycoon, a backer of the often controversial GB News TV channel which launched three years ago, has acquired the politically conservative magazine through his Old Queen Street Ventures (OQS). Marshall, who has been in exclusive talks to buy the world\u2019s oldest weekly magazine for the past month, has promised to keep the Spectator an independent part of his rapidly expanding British media empire. Marshall, who is to house the Spectator alongside UnHerd within subsidiary Old Queen Street Media, said he is \u201cconfident that OQS will be a fine custodian\u201d. \u201cThe plan is for OQS to make good previous underinvestment in one of the world\u2019s great titles,\u201d he said. Freddie Sayers, the chief executive of OQS and editor of UnHerd, will become the publisher of UnHerd and The Spectator. He said the Spectator will remain separate, with independent editorial and governance structures, including the formation of a new board likely to include Conservative politicians. \u201cIt is a very different publication to UnHerd, with its own politics, atmosphere and interests,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are committed to helping both publications develop independently.\u201d Marshall will chair the holding company but will not sit on the board or take a management position. Sayers said that the plan is to \u201cinvest in journalism and be committed to the highest standards, with a dedication to the core principles that underpin a free press: accurate presentation of news and free expression of opinion\u201d. To date Ofcom, the media regulator, has carried out 23 formal investigations amid 13 breaches of broadcast rules by GB News relating to the TV channel\u2019s lack of impartiality. The Spectator chair, Andrew Neil, a former chair at GB News who said last year that hedge funds should not be allowed to own newspapers over conflict of interest concerns, is expected to leave now that the sale is complete. Fraser Nelson, who joined the Spectator in 2006 and became editor in 2009, remains the editor of the title. Plans for the title include \u201cexpanding the magazine\u2019s reach in the Anglosphere and North America\u201d, and boosting the reader experience by \u201cinnovating across technology, video and audio\u201d. The sale represents the first stage in recouping the \u00a3600m paid by RedBird IMI \u2013 the consortium backed by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the vice-president of the United Arab Emirates and owner of Manchester City football club, and the US investment firm RedBird Capital Partners \u2013 which took control of Telegraph Media Group in November last year from the Barclay family. However, the deal was referred to UK regulators over press freedom and competition concerns. RedBird IMI was forced to put the Spectator and Telegraph titles back up for sale in the spring after the British government published legislation to block foreign states or associated individuals from owning newspaper assets in the UK. The top-end sale price for the trophy asset, more than 30 times the adjusted profits of \u00a32.9m on \u00a320.8m revenues in the last reported accounts from 2022, will give RedBirdIMI confidence that a blockbuster sale of the Telegraph titles can be achieved. The Barclay brothers paid \u00a320m for the Spectator in 2005. \u201cWe are pleased this process was completed swiftly and smoothly, maximising value and providing certainty to the Spectator staff and their growing readership,\u201d said Rani Raad, the chief executive of IMI. \u201cThe next phase of the sale of the Telegraph Media Group continues with strong interest from UK and international groups.\u201d The sale of the Daily and Sunday Telegraph is being run separately. RedBird IMI last month whittled down the shortlist of potential buyers for the next round of bidding. Marshall, who is leading a bid as part of a consortium backed by Ken Griffin, the US billionaire founder of the Citadel hedge fund, is one of about four prospective buyers in the running. Rival bidders so far revealed include the former chancellor Nadhim Zahawi. However, it is unclear if he has achieved formal commitments from billionaire backers he had held talks with about funding a \u00a3600m bid. National World, the UK-listed media group, is also thought to still be in the frame. CVC, the private equity group behind the Six Nations tournament , is understood to have held talks with other bidders about potentially making a joint offer. However, it is not clear how serious the talks have been or whether any have progressed formally."

            "content": "Households stocking up on lunchbox essentials helped drive an increase in grocery spending last month, while supermarket inflation in Great Britain dipped. Grocery price inflation fell to 1.7% in the four weeks to 1 September from 1.8% last month, according to the retail analyst Kantar, but nearly 60% of households were worried about the rising cost of their shopping. The back-to-school period included sales of fromage frais, cereal and fruit bars rising 14% over the last week of August, compared with a year ago, while sales of chocolate biscuit bars jumped by 12%. \u201cThe demand has picked up once again for lunchbox favourites as summer draws to a close and parents stock up ahead of the new school year,\u201d said Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. However, he said that, more broadly, shoppers\u2019 financial confidence had not risen. \u201cMemories of the last two years remain strong, with nearly 60% of shoppers still very or extremely concerned about rising grocery prices. This is their second biggest financial worry, only behind home energy bills,\u201d he added. Retailers are offering more deals to ease the burden, with the proportion of sales on promotion rising year on year for the 16th month in a row. More than half of all grocery trips include shoppers using some kind of deal, and this proportion rises as their spend gets bigger, McKevitt said. Prices are rising fastest for vitamins, minerals and other nutrition supplements, as well as chilled fruit juices and chocolate confectionery, and are falling fastest for toilet tissue, dog food and bottled colas. Grocery sales rose by 3% in value over the four-week period compared with a year earlier, down from 3.8% last month. Ocado was the fastest-growing supermarket for a seventh consecutive month, with sales up 12.9% year on year. Asda was the worst performer, with sales down 5.6%. The Co-op was the only other big grocer to report a sales drop, of 0.7%. Aldi, the German-owned budget retailer, said on Monday the slowdown was partly because big chains including Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s have won back customers by promising to match Aldi on key items. The UK\u2019s biggest retailer, Tesco, increased sales by 5.3% while Sainsbury\u2019s recorded a 5.7% rise. Morrisons was ahead by 2.7% while Waitrose sales rose by 4%. At the discounters, Lidl grew sales by 9.1%, while Aldi increased by only 1.3%. Retailers are waiting to see how the chancellor\u2019s autumn budget on 30 October could affect household incomings and outgoings."

            "content": "The battle to banish fur from fashion being mostly won, with almost all luxury brands fur-free, Stella McCartney is now on a mission to save the birds. \u201c1.5 billion birds are killed for their feathers by the fashion industry every year,\u201d the designer said backstage after a street catwalk show held in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, launching a campaign to put bird cruelty in the spotlight. \u201cWhen you see a pretty feather trim, or a puffer jacket with a down filling, I don\u2019t think you necessarily register that a bird has been killed. And we all love birds, right? People don\u2019t really like cows, for some reason, so it\u2019s different when you talk about leather. But birds are beautiful, and it is time to bring this issue to the attention of the industry.\u201d A million ostriches are killed each year by some estimates, with the South African ostrich industry releasing 62,000 tonnes of carbon-equivalent emissions. Feathered angel wings have been a signature look on the catwalk at Victoria\u2019s Secret for decades \u2013 the animal rights group Peta has claimed that one single fashion show used 620,000 feathers from chickens, pheasants and ostriches. Good news for McCartney came on the same day as she showed her Peace and Dove collection: Victoria\u2019s Secret confirmed this week that its show on 15 October would feature faux feathers only. Earlier this year, Copenhagen fashion week, a leader in ethical fashion, announced a ban on feathers for all designers showing there. In front of an audience that included the former Chanel creative director Virginie Viard, wearing a Stella McCartney faux-fur bomber jacket, the show began with Helen Mirren narrating a new manifesto: \u201cA world where there are only planes in the sky, and no song in the trees, will never make the heart soar.\u201d There were doves hand-painted on to silk blouses and dresses, and Prince\u2019s When Doves Cry on the soundtrack. McCartney\u2019s strategy has long been to find realistic dupes of leather, fur and animal skins so that glamour need not be compromised. There were pastel minidresses in this collection so realistically feathery that the models looked like newly hatched chicks, albeit very leggy and in stilettos. But these were made from peekaboo regenerated nylon, knitted into a powder-puff texture to resemble feathers, but produced from recycled plastic bottle tops. Jewellery with dove motifs was made from recycled electronics waste. Other creatures got a look in, too. There was a new animal-cruelty-free handbag, the Ryder, which has a gently undulating top zip inspired by the slope of a horse\u2019s spine. (McCartney\u2019s longstanding handbag bestseller, the Falabella, was named after her favourite pony.) A \u201ccrocodile\u201d Ryder was made from apple-waste vegan leather lined with hemp. \u201cWhat makes the Stella woman \u2013 or any Stella human \u2013 different, is being curious about the world, and looking at fashion from a different perspective,\u201d the designer said after the show. \u201cIt\u2019s time to take a bird\u2019s eye view.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-24T20:28:54Z",
            "content": "In a forceful speech to the UN security council, the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on a broad alliance of nations to \u201cforce Russia into peace\u201d, saying that Vladimir Putin has violated the foundations of the United Nations and that the war \u201ccan\u2019t be conquered by talks\u201d alone. Addressing the council, of which Russia is a permanent member, Zelenskyy accused Moscow of committing \u201cinternational crimes\u201d by targeting Ukrainian civilians and energy infrastructure, and claimed he had proof that Putin is plotting to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants to further degrade the country\u2019s energy grid. After thanking Ukraine\u2019s allies for their support, the Ukrainian leader appealed to countries further afield, calling on Brazil, India and countries across Africa and Latin America, to increase pressure on Russia to halt the war, saying \u201call [countries] are equally important for peace without exceptions\u201d. Many of those countries have economic or close diplomatic ties with Russia, and have given greater credence to Putin\u2019s claims that Russia was provoked into the war by the west. \u201cWe know some in the world want to talk to Putin,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cTo meet, to talk, to speak. But what could they possibly hear from him? That he\u2019s upset because we are exercising our right to defend our people? Or that he wants to keep the war and terror going, just so no one thinks he was wrong?\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s insane.\u201d Zelenskyy later this week will travel to the White House to meet with Joe Biden and discuss his \u201cvictory plan\u201d \u2013 a roadmap for Ukraine to end the war with greater western support. In his speech, he said that further pressure was needed to conclude a peace with Russia after it had been \u201cdoing things that cannot possibly be justified under the UN charter\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s why this war can\u2019t be conquered by talks,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cAction is needed \u2026 Putin has broken so many international laws and rules that he won\u2019t stop. Russia can only be forced into peace, and that is exactly what\u2019s needed, forcing Russia into peace as the sole aggressor in this war, the sole violator of the UN charter.\u201d In an interview that aired on ABC on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine needed greater support from the west to win the war, but conceded that the time for negotiations was nearing. He has repeatedly called on the US and UK to drop their restrictions on the use of long-range missiles against targets deep inside Russia, despite concerns in the Biden administration that those attacks could lead to further escalation of the war. \u201cI think that we are closer to the peace than we think,\u201d Zelenskyy said in the interview. \u201cWe are closer to the end of the war. We just have to be very strong, very strong. \u201cThe plan of victory is strengthening of Ukraine. That\u2019s why we\u2019re asking our friends, our allies, to strengthen us. It\u2019s very important.\u201d At the security council meeting, Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said the body\u2019s priority must be halting Russia\u2019s growing cooperation with Iran and North Korea. He accused both countries of providing arms that have allowed Russia to sustain its war in Ukraine, and called on members of the security council to support a \u201cjust peace\u201d that \u201cupholds the principles of the UN charter\u201d. In a likely reference to the proposal that Zelenskyy is set to discuss with Biden, Blinken said Ukraine is \u201cprepared to engage in negotiations\u201d to end the war. Blinken said Iran had provided Russia with drones, ballistic missiles \u2013 including a shipment of hundreds of missiles earlier this month \u2013 and training, in exchange for which Russia is sharing nuclear technology and \u201cspace information\u201d. He did not specify what nuclear technology Russia had provided Iran. North Korea, Blinken said, had provided \u201ctrainloads of weapons and ammunition \u2026 including ballistic missiles and launchers, and millions of artillery rounds\u201d. He also accused China, another permanent member of the security council, of being a \u201ctop provider of machine tools, microelectronics and other items that Russia is using to rebuild, restock and ramp up its war machine and sustain its brutal war\u201d. But in calling the war a \u201ctextbook example\u201d of the kind of security threat that the council had been developed to address, Blinken offered few insights into how the White House will amass a diplomatic coalition to stop the war, especially when two members accused of fueling it also sit on the security council."

            "date": "2024-09-02T08:00:27Z",
            "content": "You could see Peace\u2019s new book as his third in a series of novels centred on football bosses \u2013 the Manageriad? \u2013 after The Damned Utd (about Brian Clough) and Red or Dead (Bill Shankly). It unfolds more than three months after the Munich air disaster of 1958, when the plane carrying Matt Busby\u2019s Manchester United home from a European Cup tie in Belgrade crashed after a stop to refuel, killing 20 of the 44 people on board, with three more dying later in hospital. Writing in the third person but from the point of view of dozens of those involved \u2013 players, journalists, families \u2013 Peace dramatises the crash, its aftermath and how United, then reigning champions, managed to complete the remaining third of the season under Busby\u2019s assistant, Jimmy Murphy, miraculously reaching the FA Cup final. It\u2019s a tale of duty, guilt and blame, with the day-to-day commitments on the pitch and boardroom fulfilled amid the burying of the dead and nagging questions about why the plane crashed. A voice inside the head of goalkeeper Harry Gregg, tormented after saving fellow passengers from the wreckage, asks why no one on board spoke up about not taking off in bad weather. \u201cBecause like all people,\u201d he replies, \u201cwe\u2019re afraid to lose face in front of our friends.\u201d It\u2019s a stirring proposition but there are doubts about Peace\u2019s handling from the start, with an on-the-nose epigraph from James Joyce\u2019s The Dead introducing a prologue in which the United players, a month before the crash, enter the pitch at Arsenal in white away kit, emerging \u201cout of the tunnel like a ghost train\u201d, a line I winced to read \u2013 and that\u2019s before the first line proper, in which Bobby Charlton\u2019s mum is worrying that \u201csomething was wrong, she just didn\u2019t know what\u201d. Her friend agrees: \u201cCan you not sense there\u2019s something in the air \u2026 ?\u201d, just as Peace cuts to the wreckage. Yet the fault in Munichs isn\u2019t artistic licence \u2013 rather, its lack. After The Damned Utd, former Leeds midfielder John Giles sued Peace for his portrayal as \u201ca scheming leprechaun\u201d (Giles\u2019s words), and it\u2019s hard not to feel that Peace has been wary of taking liberties ever since, portraying Shankly from the outside in Red or Dead and doing similar here. One funeral procession after another is described via names of roads on the route; unremarkable action is narrated to imply troubled psychological states, as when we see Murphy in his garden \u201cout in the cold, damp morning, pacing up and down\u2026 holding his rosary, its beads and its crucifix in his hand, rubbing at the figure and face of Christ on the Cross as he paced, as he prayed, first asking for forgiveness, then asking for comfort, comfort for others, asking for strength, strength for others, then strength for himself, the strength to help others, the strength to go on, to somehow go on.\u201d Effective, for sure, but it also feels like a workaround; Peace is in his comfort zone whenever he can give us a good long list, as when Busby, out of hospital, at last gets to watch a match at Old Trafford only to find himself confusing living players with a team sheet of the dead. Individuation matters less than accretion \u2013 you feel Peace is seeking the basic drama of how dozens of families suffered the same agony at the same time. Throughout, there\u2019s tension from the title, because Peace doesn\u2019t explain in the novel itself that rival fans still taunt United supporters as \u201cMunichs\u201d; it\u2019s as if he wanted to frame a story about the best of football with the worst of the sport. His afterword defies anyone to read the novel and still use \u201cMunich\u201d as a slur, which seems to misunderstand his likely audience; he even says United fans (he supports Huddersfield) might reclaim the taunt as a badge of the club\u2019s uniqueness. That suggestion hints at the mood of nostalgia in which this novel was written \u2013 capturing an era in which fans awaited results in Saturday evening\u2019s paper or a footballer could be nicknamed after a character on The Archers \u2013 yet it\u2019s surely also true that the Munich disaster is the tragic prehistory underpinning the vast and much less obviously heroic commercial enterprise we know today. But my hunch is that this great author would need to be in a less wistful mood \u2013 the mood of his novel GB84, perhaps \u2013 to want to narrow his eyes at that.

            "date": "2024-09-17T21:56:22Z",
            "content": "For American diplomacy in the Middle East, the extraordinary attack in Lebanon that simultaneously detonated hundreds of pagers used by Hezbollah members could not have come at a less auspicious moment \u2013 and may still spark an escalation that the US had been seeking desperately to avoid. A day before the coordinated sabotage, Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to Joe Biden, was in Israel urging Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior Israeli officials against an escalation in Lebanon. The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, and the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, had also warned that time was running out to find a negotiated settlement between Israel and Hezbollah. What remains to be seen is whether the pager attack is a prelude to a broader operation by Israeli forces that could now take advantage of the hundreds, or perhaps even thousands, of Hezbollah operatives who have been maimed and injured. The attacks have probably disrupted the organisation\u2019s communications. The pagers were obtained as a low-risk alternative to mobile phones, allowing the group to communicate remotely without opening itself up to drone strikes as part of Israel\u2019s campaign of targeted assassinations of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. Israeli media reports suggest the operation was the result of a supply-chain hack, allowing the Mossad operatives to plant explosives into the pagers before they were sold on to Hezbollah. One video shot from southern Lebanon on Tuesday showed young men with eye injuries and large body wounds in an overflowing hospital corridor. Having shown its hand, the Israeli military may now decide to take advantage of Hezbollah\u2019s disarray before the organisation has a chance to reconstitute itself. The Israeli government last night announced that it would broaden its war aims to include the return of tens of thousands of civilians to its border with Lebanon, potentially handing Netanyahu a casus belli if he decides to launch a ground invasion into Lebanon, as some Israeli and US officials fear he will. And while US officials have said that the basis for a peace along Israel\u2019s northern boundary with Lebanon would come through a ceasefire in Gaza, that agreement has proven elusive and appears no closer to fruition. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, travelled to the Middle East on Tuesday to discuss the deal with Egypt, an intermediary to Hamas, but will bypass Israel as the latest iteration of the deal was not ready yet, a spokesperson said. The US also faces losing a key intermediary in Gallant, who has been critical of Netanyahu. His potential replacement as defence minister is Gideon Saar, the leader of the rightwing New Hope party, who is seen as more radical. The White House had hoped that a period of quiet around Israel would allow for ceasefire negotiators to achieve a breakthrough, as intermediaries shuttle between Hamas and Israel to thread the needle of both sides\u2019 complex demands regarding a hostage exchange and territorial claims. That period of quiet has now been shattered with a breathtaking act of subterfuge and Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate. With both Hamas and Hezbollah under extraordinary pressure, the US has now warned the groups\u2019 backer Iran against escalation. \u201cWe would urge Iran not to take advantage of any incident to try to add further instability and to further increase tensions in the region,\u201d said the state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller."

            "content": "Prof Tim Newburn suggests we need a public inquiry into the recent riots (\u201cRacism? Poverty, drink and social media? We still don\u2019t know why Britons rioted a month ago \u2013 and we need answers\u201d, 4 September). This is expensive and unnecessary. Misinformation via social media played a part, or why would people have started attacking asylum seekers in the false belief that they had committed murders? Rightwing rent-a-thugs seized on the opportunity to blame their favourite scapegoat. But these things channelled an anger that was already there. Why are so many people so angry at life in this country that they are prepared to riot, and scapegoat others for it? There has been considerable research into the effect of economic inequality on social cohesion, crime and health. What it shows is that economic inequality makes all of these evils worse. This is not simply about being nice to the poor. The research shows that in highly unequal societies even the better off have a poorer quality of life than they would in more equal ones. Recent polls have shown that people are in favour of increasing taxes on the rich, and this includes the rich themselves. Inequality increased colossally under the last government, with most people\u2019s wealth and incomes decreasing while the richest doubled theirs. The change that people voted for must come, or there will be more and worse riots. The past 14 years have seen a massive transfer of wealth from the less well off to the richest. That must be reversed. Shifting the balance of taxation by a relatively small amount is essential. Reducing economic inequality should be a major goal of this government, and a Labour government above all others should not be ashamed to do it. Dr Robert Forde Retired forensic psychologist, Sheffield \u2022 I am grateful to Tim Newburn for his reminder that \u201crioting is generally an indication that all is not well in the body politic\u201d. While historians will have plenty to contribute to understanding lessons from the past in relation to the origins of such riots, I wonder if turning to literature will provide useful insights. I have been reading Charles Dickens\u2019 novel Barnaby Rudge, set in the 1780s and focused on the Gordon riots \u2013 the days of violent insurrection and looting motivated by anti-Catholic sentiment fanned by key figures in the Protestant Association, particularly the figurehead, Lord George Gordon. The parallels in Dickens\u2019 depiction with what followed from the outrageous events in Southport and elsewhere last month are striking. For social media misinformation, read incendiary and anonymous handbills in 1780. For the anti-immigrant political sentiment of the past decade, read the headstrong \u201cBloody Mary\u201d speechifying in the years leading to the Gordon riots. For the state\u2019s current robust sentencing, read the executions of those manipulated to lead the riots by hidden and unscrupulous politicians \u2013 less likely to be charged. What emerges in Dickens\u2019 depiction of such a riot is the abandonment of all civilised values resulting from the mass hysterical groupthink that \u201cothers\u201d and foreigners are causing problems. The invisible leaders remain the problem. Emeritus Professor John Butcher Bedford \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

Aides used to functioning on little sleep struggle by on even less. Press releases and attack lines are meticulously prepared. As the clock clicks to 8.30am, the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics is refreshed repeatedly on hundreds of laptops and phones, until it finally lands: a 40-page statistical release entitled The Employment Situation. The monthly jobs report is widely seen as a reliable indicator of the health of the US economy. But scrutiny of its contents typically reaches a whole new level in the closing stages of an election campaign. \u201cI cannot tell you the anxiety that you feel the night before, and that morning,\u201d said Teddy Goff, digital director for Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign in 2012. As polling day neared, and each jobs report rolled around, there was a palpable fear that \u201cone bad month could take the entire enterprise down\u201d, he recalled. \u201cHad there been a fluky month in October 2012 of negative growth,\u201d said Goff, \u201cyou\u2019re thinking, \u2018OK, cool, we\u2019ve just lost the White House.\u2019\u201d And so, this Friday, as the first week of September drew to a close, staffers for both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris waited with bated breath on the latest official jobs numbers. Employers added 142,000 jobs in August \u2013 shy of expectations \u2013 and the unemployment rate slipped from 4.3% to 4.2%. Both sides pounced. Joe Biden hailed \u201chistoric gains\u201d for American workers since he and Harris took office, with almost 16m new jobs created; the Trump campaign declared that \u201cwarning lights\u201d were flashing, as \u201cfears of Kamala-induced recession\u201d purportedly mounted. Dozens of news outlets, including the Guardian, reported on the release \u2013 and what it could mean for the election. But does it matter? \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any voter who should change their vote based on Friday\u2019s release,\u201d said Jason Furman, who served as chairman of the council of economic advisers under Obama, \u201cwith the possible exception of the 12 voting members\u201d of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-setting policy committee. \u201cIf you stopped the average person in the street, they would have no idea\u201d how many jobs had been created, or how many people were out of work, in any given month, observed Stephanie Kelton, a professor of economics and public policy at Stony Brook University. And even if they did, \u201cpeople are not moving between camps because of a tenth of a percentage point shift in the unemployment rate,\u201d she added. With a campaign this close, however, anything can shift the dial. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in an election that\u2019s basically tied, even very small events could be the difference between winning and losing,\u201d said Furman. \u201cIn terms of economic data, there are really a very small number of big events between now and election day.\u201d Between now and 5 November, when tens of millions of Americans will cast their votes, there will be two updates to the consumer price index, the closely watched inflation gauge; two more jobs reports; and a gross domestic product (GDP) economic growth estimate for the third quarter. Each will be dissected, debated and described in great detail. The world\u2019s largest economy has reached a critical juncture at the exact moment when the US election kicks into its final gears. When inflation surged to its highest level in a generation two years ago, policymakers scrambled \u2013 and ultimately raised interest rates to a two-decade high \u2013 in an attempt to cool the economy, and bring down price growth. With inflation now heading back towards more typical levels, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has signaled that the central bank would start to cut rates this month. The US labor market now faces greater \u201cdownside risks\u201d, Powell acknowledged. The apprehension about this next phase was laid bare in August, when disappointing jobs data for the previous month triggered a sharp, albeit fleeting, global stock market sell-off. The sell-off was news around the world and brought greater \u2013 negative \u2013 attention to a jobs report that while weaker than expected was still positive. While the US economy has staged a remarkable recovery from the depths of the pandemic, a majority of Americans do not appear to recognize this. A Harris poll for the Guardian in May, for example, found that 55% wrongly believed the economy was in recession. \u201cThere is a degree to which people just perceive the economy to be worse than it is,\u201d said Goff. \u201cPart of it is just that the media has a bias toward negative stuff. The individual murderer gets reported on ad nauseam in the local news. The declining murder rate over the course of three decades doesn\u2019t get any coverage. There\u2019s that same phenomenon attached to the economy.\u201d There also appears to be a disconnection between how official economic data informs voters about the economy and how voters experience it in their day-to-day lives. Does last month\u2019s inflation reading matter when your grocery bill is up by a quarter in four years? How much attention would you pay to August\u2019s nationwide unemployment rate if you, or a relative, had recently lost their job? The Trump campaign, which claims Biden has destroyed jobs and fueled inflation, is clearly seeking the support of those directly affected by economic disruption since 2021. \u201cVoters, particularly the voters that will decide elections, they don\u2019t think about the economy through the prism of any government statistics,\u201d David Plouffe, who managed Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, told the Axe Files podcast in March. He later joined the Harris campaign as senior adviser. Obama won in 2012 with the highest unemployment rate of any re-elected president since 1936. \u201cIt was coming down,\u201d Plouffe noted, \u201cso people felt good on trajectory.\u201d Should the Fed start reducing rates this month, as indicated, \u201cperhaps at the margin, in the tiniest of ways\u201d, some people might start to feel better about the economy, Kelton suggested. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a little bit of a vibe shift in having the rate-cutting cycle begin, and knowing it\u2019s under way.\u201d In a race this close, that vibe shift, or the lack of it, may well decide the race. Could the noise created by a few good or bad economic reports tip the balance? For some time already, there has been a gulf between Americans\u2019 words and actions. Right now \u201cwhen people have to put money behind their statements, they are very optimistic,\u201d said Furman, now a professor at Harvard University. \u201cThey are spending lots of money. Businesses are investing a lot.\u201d And yet, \u201cwhen they talk to pollsters and no money is at stake, they are quite negative,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen they get into the ballot box, will they think more like they do in a store, or when they\u2019re talking to a pollster? No one knows.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-12T10:00:09Z",
            "content": "Boeing\u2019s new chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, has pleaded with workers to not go on strike, before a crucial union vote, saying the action would put the company\u2019s \u201crecovery in jeopardy\u201d. About 33,000 aircraft assembly workers, most of them in the Seattle area, are to vote on Thursday on a pay offer that includes rises worth 25% over four years. If the members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) reject the contract offer and two-thirds of them vote to strike, a stoppage would start in the early hours of Friday, just after midnight in Seattle. Shutting down production would not cause flight cancellations but would be another blow to Boeing\u2019s reputation and finances. The aircraft maker has lurched from crisis to crisis since two 737 Max airliners crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. Then in January, a cabin panel blew out of a Max mid-flight, and the planemaker was investigated after several whistleblowers came forward with allegations about their experiences working for Boeing \u2013 and the safety of its planes. Ortberg told machinists on Wednesday: \u201cNo one wins\u201d in a strike. \u201cFor Boeing, it is no secret that our business is in a difficult period, in part due to our own mistakes in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cWorking together, I know that we can get back on track, but a strike would put our shared recovery in jeopardy, further eroding trust with our customers and hurting our ability to determine our future together.\u201d Although the bargaining committee that negotiated the contract recommended members approve it, Jon Holden, the IAM District 751 president, who represents more than 32,000 aerospace workers at Boeing and other suppliers, said earlier this week that the strike vote would go ahead. Many workers have complained about the deal on social media. Voting will take place at union halls in Washington state, Portland, Oregon, and other locations, with results expected to be released on Thursday night. Holden told members on Monday that the union obtained everything possible in bargaining and recommended approval of the deal \u201cbecause we can\u2019t guarantee we can achieve more in a strike\u201d. The deal fell short of the union\u2019s initial demand for pay raises of 40% over three years. Many workers are also unhappy about their pensions. A strike would halt production of the 737 Max, the company\u2019s bestselling airliner, along with the 777 jet and the 767 cargo plane at factories in Everett and Renton, Washington, near Seattle. It is not expected to affect Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which are built by non-union workers in South Carolina. The Jefferies analyst Chloe Lemarie said: \u201cThis represents a key risk for 737 Max production levels.\u201d Over time, the disruption could lead to market share losses to rival Airbus\u2019s A320neo, she said. Cai von Rumohr, a senior aerospace analyst at TD Cowen, said a strike could last into mid-November, which could cost Boeing up to $3.5bn (\u00a32.7bn) in cashflow because the company gets about 60% of the sale price when it delivers a plane to the buyer."

            "date": "2024-09-30T10:00:11Z",
            "content": "Kamala Harris\u2019s economic policies proved far more popular than Donald Trump\u2019s plans in a blind test of their proposals. Four of the top five most popular proposals were from the Democratic candidate\u2019s campaign, according to a new Harris Poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. The poll showed strong optimism from Democrats about Harris\u2019s presidential candidacy but \u2013 once again \u2013 highlighted pessimism around the US economy from both sides of the aisle. Americans surveyed were given a list of 12 policy proposals \u2013 six from Harris\u2019s campaign and six from Trump\u2019s. The poll did not say whose campaign the proposals came from. The most popular proposal was a federal ban on the price-gouging of food and groceries \u2013 a Democratic proposal that some leading economists have criticized. Nearly half (44%) of all those polled agreed that it would strengthen the economy. Harris\u2019s price gouging proposal is designed to help address the top economic issue of respondents: cost of living. A majority of those polled (66%) indicated that the cost of living was one of their biggest economic concerns right now. Other Harris proposals that voters liked included expanding the child tax credit (33%) and selected tax breaks for new small businesses (33%). The only Trump plan to break the top five was his proposal to cut taxes on social security benefits (42%). But Trump\u2019s policies are popular with his base: when asked about his proposal for the mass deportation of millions of migrants, 43% of Republicans said it would be good for the economy versus 24% of independents and 15% of Democrats. In more good news for Harris, independent voters, a key group this election, seemed to favor Harris\u2019s policies over Trump\u2019s. Four out of the five top policies selected by independents are from Harris\u2019s campaign. Since Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race two months ago, paving the way for Harris to become the Democratic candidate, she has tried to craft her own economic platform. This has involved shifting away from Bidenomics, which failed to ignite much enthusiasm on the campaign trail. In the Harris/Guardian poll conducted last September, a majority of Democrats (62%) said that while Bidenomics was good in theory, it wasn\u2019t being implemented well. Harris instead has been promoting her \u201copportunity economy\u201d, which focuses on rising costs, rather than issues like infrastructure and manufacturing, which were key components of Bidenomics. The shift in focus seems to be working. Harris\u2019s policies were particularly popular with younger Americans, an increasingly powerful voting bloc.Some 87% of millennials and gen Z voters said that at least one of Harris\u2019s proposals would be good for the economy, versus 79% of young voters who said the same for Trump. Of the four generations polled, millennial voters seemed to be the most onboard with Harris\u2019s candidacy, energized by her appointment after President Biden withdrew. The majority of millennials (59%) said that Harris\u2019s policies are better than Biden\u2019s, compared to just 36% of Boomers. Democratic voters as a whole seem to think Harris turned out to be the better candidate: when asked if their lives would be better if Harris or Biden won the election, 80% of Democratic voters went with Harris. Though Harris has received criticism for being \u201clight on policy\u201d, a majority of all voters in the poll suggested they understand her policies just fine. More than 60% of voters said they understood Harris\u2019s policies on the economy. Slightly more voters said they understood where Trump stands on certain issues more than Harris, but most of the differences were small. The widest gap was seen in how voters understand the candidate\u2019s tax policies, with 70% of voters indicating that they understood Trump\u2019s pledges, while 62% said the same for Harris. \u201cDespite some skepticism that VP Harris has yet to define where she stands, our data shows she\u2019s energized her base \u2013 particularly millennials, who will be the largest voting bloc this election \u2013 by effectively messaging and connecting with them on the issues they are facing as they move more into adulthood: childcare, housing and jobs,\u201d said John Gerzema, CEO of Harris Poll. Across the board, Americans still seem to be down about the economy \u2013 negativity that has persisted since Harris Poll and the Guardian first asked voters their thoughts about the economy last September, and again in May. Since the last poll in May, the economy improved across several key measures. Inflation fell back to 2.5% in August, the lowest it\u2019s been since 2021, and has been going down for the last five months. Though there have been some anemic job growth reports, unemployment is still relatively low at 4.2%. And the stock market has hit record highs in September. And all of this is despite the decades-high interest rates, which the US Federal Reserve only started to cut this month. But Americans are still feeling sour. When asked how they feel about the US economy now, compared with the start of the summer, 35% of respondents said they were more pessimistic, while 29% felt more optimistic (29%). Nearly three-quarters (73%) of all polled said they did not feel any positive effects of good economic news today. A majority of Americans (61%) believe inflation is increasing, when it has actually fallen significantly from its peak in 2022. And nearly half of those polled, 49%, said they believed the US economy was experiencing a recession. The US is not in recession. Though many seem to believe the economy is worse than it really is \u2013 particularly when looking at macroeconomic measures like inflation, unemployment and interest rates \u2013 most Americans are actually feeling better about their own personal financial situations. More Americans indicated they were confident in their overall personal finances (61%) and their ability to afford necessities (72%) compared with May. And when asked if they felt better off financially than their parents, 58% of those polled agreed \u2013 8% more than when the same question was asked last September. As shown with the last two Confidence Question polls, beliefs about the economy tend to be shaped by a person\u2019s political party. Democrats are far more likely to feel better about the economy than Republicans. Half of Democrats, 51%, compared with 30% of Republicans, said they feel optimistic about the future of the US economy. Something that Americans from both parties agree on: they still don\u2019t know who to trust when it comes to learning about the economy. And most respondents (78%) also agreed that most people don\u2019t know how the US economy is actually doing, despite it being their top priority in the election. This survey was conducted online within the US by the Harris Poll from 12 to 14 September 2024 among a nationally representative sample of 2,122. The margin of error for the survey is 2.6 percentage points."

            "date": "2024-09-07T11:00:18Z",
            "content": "If Steve Clarke\u2019s Scotland regime is to spiral beyond the point of no return, it will do so on the manager\u2019s own terms. Seven of the players who started the now infamous defeat by Hungary \u2013 the performance offended Scottish fans, not the result \u2013 did likewise as Poland visited Hampden Park on Nations League business. The figure would be higher, but for the international retirement of Callum McGregor and the decision of Ch\u00e9 Adams to remain with Torino for reasons that remain a matter of considerable discussion. Fans who want Clarke to rip it up and start again ignore two core facts. The manager is understandably loyal to a group of players who have generally served him well. There is also no batch of fresh talent waiting in the wings, a matter that will become perfectly obvious to Clarke\u2019s eventual successor. Scottish football continues to turn blind eyes shamefully to its inability to produce and develop first-team players to a point that will properly assist the national team to grow. Cheerleaders lap up the weekly dross served by the Scottish top flight. Clarke got the absolute most out of what was available to him for so long; it may simply be the case that his Scotland team peaked somewhere along the qualification road to Euro 2024. When your luck is out, your luck is out; eight minutes of Scottish time against the Poles was largely on account of faulty video assistant referee equipment. Poland scored their winner in the seventh of them. Against this grim backdrop, it is logical that the Tartan Army cling to green shoots. Ben Doak impressed from the bench in the wounding loss, the teenager\u2019s pace and purpose no shock to anybody who has watched him at youth level. Doak\u2019s combination play with Anthony Ralston was of clear benefit to the much (and unfairly) maligned Celtic full-back. Doak has a strong case to start when Scotland take on Portugal in Lisbon on Sunday but there must be appreciation of where his career stands. The 18-year-old remains underexposed to first-team football. A loan to Middlesbrough may not signal the beginning of the end for his first-team aspirations at Liverpool. Still, Arne Slot plainly thinks Doak has to develop considerably before he can reach the status many in Scotland seem to believe he is at already. \u201cHe is a hungry individual,\u201d said the Scotland captain, Andy Robertson, of Doak last week. \u201cHe is very determined to do the best for himself and for the team, and that is important. He is exciting but we have to be careful. He is a young player. He needs to gain experience. He needs to work on things. He knows that. \u201cThe quality that he does have is very good. I think he will have a fantastic career at whatever level that may be. He will have a good international career, but it is important that we are patient with him. It is important that we see him grow. That is the key thing. Sometimes we get on top of young players far too quickly.\u201d Ryan Gauld, once of \u201cMini Messi\u201d fame, knows all about that. Gauld has been drafted back into the Scotland setup at the age of 28. Gauld, who left Dundee United for Sporting at 18, may revel in a return to the Portuguese capital. He earns rave reviews for his performances at Vancouver Whitecaps; those who decry Major League Soccer ignore the evidence that players throughout that domain cope perfectly well with international football. Gauld\u2019s elegance sets him apart from his Scottish peers but it feels as if he has to somehow prove he can be more than a luxury player. Grant Hanley\u2019s inexplicable error in those dying embers of the Poland clash, which handed the visitors a match-winning penalty, means it would look bizarre if the centre-half is picked to face Cristiano Ronaldo and co. John Souttar can slot in at right centre-back. Beyond that, Clarke is glaringly short of alternatives. Options to replace Lyndon Dykes at centre-forward are Lawrence Shankland, who has been awful for Hearts this season, and the untried Tommy Conway. Doak and Gauld are the two forward-thinking players who not only have a cause to be given a chance but would excite a browbeaten supporter base. Clarke is just unlikely to care about the latter element."

            "date": "2024-09-19T12:56:19Z",
            "content": "It was only last season that Sean Payton rocked up in Denver and set a blowtorch to everything that came before, labelling Nathaniel Hackett\u2019s spell in charge of the Broncos one of \u201cthe worst coaching jobs\u201d in NFL history. It would be nice to know where he thinks his first two games of this season stack up in the rankings. The Broncos have started the season 0-2. Push the timeline back further and Denver have only won two of their last eight games, with both wins coming over a team quarterbacked by Easton Stick. Through two weeks this season, the Broncos\u2019 offense has laid an egg in four out of eight quarters. Payton, once at the vanguard of offensive football, looks someone out of ideas \u2013 or at least out of time. His offense is stuck in 2013, and is led by a rookie quarterback, Bo Nix, who looks in over his head. The advanced metrics this season put Denver\u2019s offense ahead of only the awful Carolina Panthers, a team who benched their quarterback this week, in part, because they are worried he has trouble seeing over the line of scrimmage. Payton seems as befuddled as anyone by Denver\u2019s ineptitude. \u201cWe have to start really looking at who we are asking to do what,\u201d he said on Sunday. \u201cWhat scheme fits our players? What scheme fits our quarterback?\u201d You would hope a coach would have the answers to those questions before they chucked an underbaked rookie out against two of the best defenses in the league. At first blush, hiring Payton made sense. He was a decorated coach who would bring instant credibility to an organization that had become a laughing stock. The Broncos had a new ownership group, and they were happy to fork over $18m a year and a couple of draft picks to land a coach with Super Bowl pedigree. But there is starting to be a hint of Phil Jackson with the New York Knicks about the Payton era: a fabled leader a step out of time. One who has accumulated all the power in the organization with none of the required patience to see through a true rebuild. Payton has chased sugar highs throughout his time in Denver. But his most important decision came this offseason when he ran off Russell Wilson, sunk the franchise further into salary cap hell, and handpicked Nix as his replacement. Denver drafted Nix 12th overall, far higher than most draft prognosticators (and other teams\u2019 executives) had him slated. Payton\u2019s reasoning for falling for Nix was hazy at best, but he seemed to have a genuine belief that the young quarterback could, over time, become something approaching a facsimile of Drew Brees, who turned Payton\u2019s offensive ideas into something approaching art with the New Orleans Saints. But the early returns have been grim. Denver lack talent at the skill positions, their offensive line has been crushed and Nix looks lost playing in one of the league\u2019s most complicated offenses. By now you\u2019ve probably seen the clip of Nix from Denver\u2019s 13-6 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday. The rookie stepped into the huddle to reel off a playcall. Confusion ensued. Denver failed to get the snap off in time and were forced to burn a timeout. If you missed that one, you probably caught the handful of other times the Broncos had struggles lining up, the team\u2019s receivers glancing to the sideline, eyes bulging, arms raised as they wondered what was going on. All rookie quarterbacks experience growing pains; things haven\u2019t been rosy for Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears either. NFL defenses are faster and often more sophisticated than those in college. NFL offenses are more expansive, putting a higher burden on quarterbacks who have played in watered-down college schemes. As the gulf between what is asked of quarterbacks at the pro and college levels has widened, though, teams have become wise about how they can help young quarterbacks develop. Coaches will twist the language of their playbook or mimic plays that a rookie had success with in college to ease their transition to the league. The Bengals imported Joe Burrow\u2019s LSU playbook when they drafted him No 1 overall in 2020 \u2013 and added college teammate Ja\u2019Marr Chase to help the process along. Andy Reid and the Kansas City Chiefs allowed Patrick Mahomes to sit during his rookie season. Once Mahomes was handed the starting gig, Reid twisted the language and design of his offense to fit what had worked for his quarterback in college, slowly adding in new elements. It was the same in Green Bay for Jordan Love, who was given three seasons to sit and learn behind Aaron Rodgers. Nix has been thrown in at the deep end, in an offense with no training wheels. The video of Nix\u2019s struggles in the huddle is indicative of a broader problem with the Broncos: the Sean Payton problem. The coach is infamous for his wordy playcalls. Rookie or not, he drops the motherlode on a quarterback and expects them to pick it up quickly. Wilson, an experienced quarterback, had struggles with the novel-length calls last season, but for a rookie like Nix it has hit wince-inducing territory. Nix spent five years in college running a system that relied upon a couple of words or an image being flashed in from the sideline to call plays. In Denver, he\u2019s lining up in the huddle for the first time and being asked to reel off pro football\u2019s equivalent of The Stand before the offense can run a play. Here\u2019s one example. At Auburn, Nix\u2019s first college stop, Nix ran a play that is a staple at every level of football \u2013 a simple play-action pass. Its name: GAS NAKED. When he transferred to Oregon, the coaching staff in Eugene adopted the same language. They already ran the same play, but were happy to adapt to Nix\u2019s language. In Denver, Payton is asking Nix to call things the coach\u2019s way. Suddenly, the same play transforms from \u2018Gas Naked\u2019 to a Tolkien-esque \u2018KING SNUG RT ON 52 SMASH Z JERK KILL Q-8 Z SPEED SMASH (ALERT PIPE)\u2019. It\u2019s no wonder the rookie looks disoriented. There are good reasons why NFL coaches prefer elongated play calls \u2013 one being there are more plays to learn than in college and they want to make sure everyone knows their exact role. But to not offer a playcalling lifeline to a struggling rookie is self-defeating. When the Broncos have been able to get the ball off in time, the results have been gnarly. Nothing is more telling than Nix\u2019s numbers throwing down the field. Payton has made a career out of fashioning the best deep passing game in the NFL. Nix is not blessed with the strongest arm \u2013 but neither did Brees towards the end of his career \u2013 and Payton\u2019s offense is designed to engineer chunk plays for quarterbacks who lack Josh Allen\u2019s flamethrower. Even pushing the ball beyond the sticks has been a challenge so far this season. On throws of 10 yards or more, Nix has thrown twice as many turnover-worthy throws and interceptions as he has completions, according to ProFootballFocus. He has played against two outstanding defenses in the Steelers and Seahawks, but those figures are illustrative of a player who can\u2019t keep up with what is asked of him and is throwing in hope more than expectation. It\u2019s meaningful that Nix, like Wilson before him, has been at his best when improvising or playing in the two-minute drill, when the playbook slims down and he\u2019s free to escape the constraints of the offense. Payton grew tired of Wilson\u2019s ad-libbing, but it\u2019s the only spot where Nix has shown signs of promise. Payton\u2019s offense was once the wonder of the league. He was at the cutting edge. In Brees, he had a ruthless and efficient conductor. But those heady days of Saints football are falling further in the rearview mirror. In Denver, he\u2019s populated his staff with buddies from his New Orleans days \u2013 eight coaches on the Broncos worked for Payton in New Orleans. And it shows. They have continued to trot out the greatest hits from the past, but appear to have forgotten the frontman, Brees, was crucial to knitting everything together. If the job of a coach is to put players in the best spot to succeed, then Payton has so far failed. He\u2019s hung his rookie out to dry, bogging Nix down in an offense that\u2019s beyond his capacity \u2013 playing on a roster lacking the talent to cover up his flaws. If he is unwilling to adapt, Payton should grant Nix a spell on the sidelines before the confidence is irrevocably knocked out of him."

            "date": "2024-09-28T06:00:08Z",
            "content": "Almost everybody on the planet knows what a passenger aeroplane looks like. Its shape hasn\u2019t changed for decades. Take the world\u2019s bestselling liner, the Boeing 737: the first model in 1967 looks roughly the same as the latest version, the 737 Max. Yet that extraordinary run may be about to change as manufacturers look at a new wave of innovations that could literally change the shape of aviation. Longer, thinner wings, jet engines with uncovered fans, and an approach that blends the wing into the body of the plane are all being considered by manufacturers, in a potential shift away from the decades-old \u201ctube and wing\u201d approach. The aviation industry is under pressure to cut the carbon emissions from aircraft, which are responsible for 2.5% of global emissions (but 4% of warming effects). Yet the possible solutions touted have been limited in different ways: \u201csustainable\u201d aviation fuel (SAF) is not being produced at industrial scale, batteries are not yet dense enough for most flights, and there has been no hydrogen technology breakthrough. But aircraft manufacturers believe there are still major gains that can be made on fuel efficiency instead as they gear up for new planes by the middle of the next decade. That could make air travel cheaper. More efficient planes could also give the industry some political cover, even as total carbon emissions continue to rise. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be out of runway in terms of conventional design,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, the managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, a consultancy. \u201cTo have a prayer of getting fuel burn under control, radical ideas are already the way to go.\u201d Less of a drag Boeing is under particular pressure to come up with a breakthrough design. It updated the same rough blueprint for the 737 series over decades, but that approach ended after design compromises contributed to two crashes and 346 deaths in 2018 and 2019. Boeing faced an existential crisis, and has fallen far behind Airbus. In July, Boeing appointed Robert \u201cKelly\u201d Ortberg as its new chief executive. At some point soon, he will have to turn his attention towards the embattled company\u2019s next plane. The \u201ctransonic\u201d truss-braced wing, being developed in partnership with the US space agency, Nasa, could help. It combines a longer, much thinner wing (braced by a truss) capable of transonic flight (just below the speed of sound). Boeing said initial tests showed a 9% fuel burn reduction. It hopes to get to a 30% reduction, combined with other technologies, and is aiming to fly a demonstrator in 2028, with an in-service target of between 2030 and 2035. In a factory in Bristol that originally built Blenheim bombers during the second world war, Airbus is also pushing for advances in wing technology. Sue Partridge, who leads Airbus\u2019s commercial aircraft operations in the UK, said last year that \u201cthe physics tells us the wing needs to be longer and more slender\u201d to give more lift for less drag. \u201cThe wing should give us as much impact on fuel burn as the next generation of engines,\u201d she said. Airbus\u2019s chief executive, Guillaume Faury, has indicated that the next generation of aircraft will probably look fairly similar to those in service now. However, the European planemaker is also looking at a concept that merges the main body with the wing. That would be a much more radical departure, giving the advantage of the plane\u2019s body itself contributing to lift. A startup, JetZero, claims its \u201cblended wing\u201d can cut fuel burn in half. And Delft University in the Netherlands has tested a 3-metre model of its Flying-V aeroplane concept, which shares a similar approach. Different designs could work better for different uses, said Jerry Lundquist, a consultant and former US air force officer who previously led McKinsey\u2019s aerospace consulting. Blended wings may work better for longer journeys, but they could also throw up problems. For one, passengers would be seated across a significantly wider area, putting them further from any windows \u2013 and maybe requiring screens to simulate daylight. And those seated on the outside could find their stomachs lurching as they feel greater \u201cmoment\u201d, or turning force. \u201cYou need to make sure they aren\u2019t subjected to intense forces,\u201d Lundquist said. Engine of change Efficiency gains from engines will still be vital for the industry. The most marked change in the appearance of engines could be the return of the open propeller. The design dispenses with the nacelle \u2013 the cover \u2013 to allow for a bigger fan that offers more propulsive force. Superficially, it will look like existing turboprop engines, but with the ability to fly at Mach 0.8, or 80% of the speed of sound \u2013 the same as current jet engines. CFM, a joint-venture between America\u2019s General Electric and France\u2019s Safran, has said that its open fan Rise engine could theoretically reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions by 20%. The company says it can reduce noise, which put paid to a previous prototype in 1986. It will still have to persuade regulators and passengers that the engines will be safe if a blade breaks in midair. As well as radical changes to airframes or engines, manufacturers are constantly looking for ways to salami-slice fuel burn via small gains. Winglets, the curved tips of wings, were first introduced in the 1970s in response to the then oil crisis, mimicking birds\u2019 wings to reduce drag. The split winglets on the 737 family since 2014 can reduce fuel burn by as much as 2% during a long journey, according to the Seattle-based manufacturer Aviation Partners. (For plane-spotters, they double as the easiest way to distinguish a 737 from an A320.) Birds have had millennia to evolve the ideal features for efficient flight, so aviation designers have constantly used them for inspiration. Airbus is experimenting with gust sensors on the front of the aircraft to register during turbulence, with automatic responses from control surfaces of the wing, similar to a bird\u2019s constant adjustments to movements in the air. Concorde, which flew on only a limited number of routes, was the last passenger plane in service with a truly distinctive design. The supersonic jet, which had swept-back, delta wings, was retired in 2003. Boom Supersonic, a startup, is testing the technologies for a proposed \u201cson of Concorde\u201d with a similar look. That plane would only ever be a niche service, flying 80 passengers at a time on premium routes. But there is a possibility that Boeing and Airbus take radically different approaches to the workhorses that carry billions of passengers each year. If the manufacturers go in different directions, then passengers might start paying serious attention to plane design, says Addison Schonland, an analyst who tracks the industry at AirInsight. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had a situation before, to look at an aeroplane and say, \u2018that\u2019s completely different\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cHow will people react to seeing those novel shapes?\u201d"

            "content": "Not 18 hours after Leeds indie band English Teacher won the Mercury prize for their debut album, singer Lily Fontaine told the Guardian: \u201cWe\u2019re still pinching ourselves, really.\u201d Their Top 10 widely acclaimed This Could Be Texas beat the favourite Charli xcx, along with efforts by the likes of Corinne Bailey Rae and Portishead\u2019s Beth Gibbons. \u201cTo win it in a room where there were people such as Corinne or Beth that inspired me is just amazing, like a dream I keep expecting to wake up from. I went up to Beth and just said: \u2018You\u2019re incredible.\u2019\u201d Earlier, this year, English Teacher told the Guardian that despite being signed to a major label, Island, enjoying radio and TV exposure and being able to play 800-capacity shows in their home town, both Fontaine and bandmate Lewis Whiting recorded their album while living at home, sofa-surfing and relying on universal credit to top up the band\u2019s \u00a3500 a month from the record company advance. The Mercury comes with a \u00a325,000 cheque although the band haven\u2019t decided what to do with it. Fontaine insists: \u201cIt will be invested, not frittered away.\u201d The band\u2019s triumph comes as the Mercury prize faces questions about its future. It no longer has a sponsor and this year\u2019s live ceremony was considerably scaled back. However, English Teacher point out that unlike many awards ceremonies, which reflect commercial success, the Mercury recognises art, originality and innovation, so remains relevant. \u201cSo many of our favourite bands won the Mercury or were nominated for the shortlist,\u201d said Whiting. \u201cArctic Monkeys. Pulp. Radiohead. Portishead. There\u2019s kudos and recognition, but it\u2019s about the artist, not their sales.\u201d And since they were shortlisted, said Fontaine, \u201cwe\u2019ve been able to play bigger gigs for higher fees. So we\u2019re hoping to be able to put up our personal income.\u201d Whiting said he had already noticed a surge in their streaming figures: \u201cI looked this morning and there were 3,000 people listening to one track.\u201d English Teacher\u2019s win is the first for an alt-rock band since Wolf Alice in 2018 and, incredibly, the first for a non-London act since Edinburgh hip-hop trio Young Fathers in 2014. \u201cWhich is ridiculous,\u201d said Fontaine, \u201cconsidering the quality of music coming from other places. Maybe it [reveals] what the industry puts the spotlight on, because there\u2019e certainly no lack of talent.\u201d English Teacher are one of three Leeds-based nominees on this year\u2019s list alongside Bailey Rae and jungle producer Nia Archives. Fontaine acknowledged that without the support of the city\u2019s launchpad venues such the Hyde Park Book Club and Brudenell Social Club, \u201cwe\u2019d definitely not be here\u201d. Whiting and Fontaine both grew up in small Lancashire towns. The win completes the singer\u2019s remarkable journey from \u201cdoing open mics in Colne when I was 14, performing in pubs and clubs after leaving school and working in a Chinese takeaway,\u201d she said. English Teacher formed at Leeds Conservatoire \u2013 formerly Leeds College of Music \u2013 and played their first gig in 2020. Along the way, the band have been supported by talent development organisation Music:Leeds, whose Launchpad programme distributed the first two self-released English Teacher singles including the first version of The World\u2019s Biggest Paving Slab, a song they rerecorded for the winning album, which Fontaine first wrote in her bedroom six years ago. Music:Leeds and PRS Foundation\u2019s PPL Momentum Accelerator fund also provided funding for the band to record the first version of R&amp;B, a song also rerecorded for their debut. However, Music:Leeds had recently struggled to get funding from Arts Council England or regional funds, said director Whiskas (AKA Samuel Nicholls). \u201cWe have not been able to run Momentum Accelerator funding since 2023 \u2013 so currently this fund that was pivotal for English Teacher\u2019s journey is not available to others in the region.\u201d He lamented their inability to support local artists, given that English Teacher\u2019s win made \u201ca real statement about the nature of experimentation and bravery of music-making in the region. I thought all three Leeds nominees displayed that. English Teacher feel like a real product of the city, of the melting pot of people, places and organisations striving to give people a chance.\u201d Fontaine says that cuts to arts funding upset her because \u201cif we hadn\u2019t had that funding, we wouldn\u2019t have recorded that single, so we wouldn\u2019t have got signed to Island. We are a case study that it works.\u201d The band also received funding from Youth Music, whose CEO Matt Griffiths said: \u201cThis is the second year in a row that artists supported and backed by grassroots organisations have won this prize. It\u2019s also a sign of promise to see a regional shift in the London powerhouse.\u201d Fontaine said that her lyrics have been informed by growing up in the north, \u201cbeing born in Huddersfield, living in Colne, moving to Leeds, moving between races and even sexualities, and not really having a sense of home. I hope our win can show other people in communities outside London that you can have a voice.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-29T22:27:01Z",
            "content": "California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, on Sunday vetoed a hotly contested artificial intelligence safety bill after the tech industry raised objections. Newsom said that requiring companies to stress-test large AI models before releasing them could drive AI businesses from the state and hinder innovation. \u201cCalifornia is home to 32 of the world\u2019s 50 leading AI companies,\u201d the governor said in a statement accompanying the veto. \u201cThe bill applies stringent standards to even the most basic functions \u2013 so long as a large system deploys it. I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting the public from real threats posed by the technology.\u201d The Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act, officially known as SB 1047, would have targeted companies developing generative AI \u2013 which can respond to prompts with fully formed text, images or audio, as well as run repetitive tasks with minimal intervention. Companies building models costing more than $100m would have been required to implement \u201ckill switches\u201d for their AI as well as publish plans for the testing and mitigation of extreme risks. Newsom said he had asked leading experts from the US AI Safety Institute on generative AI to help California \u201cdevelop workable guardrails\u201d that focus \u201con developing an empirical, science-based trajectory analysis\u201d. He also ordered state agencies to expand their assessment of the risks from potential catastrophic events tied to AI use. Despite the veto, the governor said: \u201cWe cannot afford to wait for a major catastrophe to occur before taking action to protect the public \u2026 Safety protocols must be adopted.\u201d \u201cWhile well-intentioned, SB 1047 does not take into account whether an AI system is deployed in high-risk environments, involves critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data,\u201d Newsom wrote. \u201cFor these reasons, I cannot sign this bill.\u201d SB 1047, written by the Democratic state senator Scott Wiener of San Francisco, included a number of protections and oversight measures including requiring companies to implement the ability to shut down the model completely in the case of emergencies, to only use the AI model for the stated purpose as well as whistleblower protections for employees looking to disclose issues with an AI system. In response to Newsom\u2019s veto, Wiener said: \u201cThis veto leaves us with the troubling reality that companies aiming to create an extremely powerful technology face no binding restrictions from US policymakers \u2026 At the same time, the debate around SB 1047 has dramatically advanced the issue of AI safety on the international stage.\u201d AI companies and groups allied with Silicon Valley praised Newsom\u2019s veto. The venture capitalist Marc Andreessen wrote: \u201cThank you @gavinnewsom for vetoing SB1047 \u2013 for siding with California dynamism, economic growth, and freedom to compute, over safetyism, doomerism, and decline.\u201d \u201cWe are pleased that Governor Newsom vetoed SB1047. This bill would have stifled AI innovation, hurt business growth and job creation, and broken the state\u2019s long tradition of fostering open-source development. We support responsible AI regulations and remain committed to partnering with lawmakers to promote better approaches,\u201d said a Meta spokesperson, Jamie Radice. The company\u2019s chief AI scientist, Yann Lecun, had likewise called the bill \u201cextremely regressive\u201d. The California representatives Nancy Pelosi and Ro Khanna, both Democrats, had voiced their opposition to it in the weeks leading up to Newsom\u2019s decision. Breaking with much of the tech industry, the Tesla CEO and X owner, Elon Musk, had offered measured support for the legislation, tweeting in August that \u201cCalifornia should probably pass the SB 1047 AI safety bill,\u201d though he said coming out in favor of it was a \u201ctough call\u201d. Critics of AI\u2019s rapid growth decried the governor\u2019s decision. Daniel Colson, the founder of AI thinktank the AI Policy Institution, called Newsom\u2019s veto \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cout of step with the people he\u2019s tasked with governing\u201d. SB 1047 had come under intense criticism for how some organizations say it would affect the open-source community. The Mozilla Foundation, a non-profit that owns the developer of the Mozilla Firefox browser, previously urged Newsom to veto the bill. \u201cToday, we see parallels to the early Internet in the AI ecosystem, which has also become increasingly closed and consolidated in the hands of a few large, tech companies,\u201d the foundation wrote in an earlier statement. \u201cWe are concerned that SB 1047 would further this trend, harming the open-source community and making AI less safe \u2013 not more.\u201d The bill received support from a roster of Hollywood artists, who urged Newsom to sign the bill in a letter published earlier this month. The actor Mark Ruffalo wrote in a statement: \u201cIs this bill perfect? Nothing is. Does it set the right tone of regulating an industry that has the possibility of doing great harm as well as good? It does. It will protect society and set the groundwork for a safe AI expansion into our lives.\u201d"

            "content": "Britain\u2019s future Nobel prizes will come from encouraging young people into university rather than making sandwiches in high street chains, according to the science secretary Peter Kyle, who declared that the previous government\u2019s \u201cwar on universities\u201d had ended. Taking aim at claims that too many school-leavers went to university, Kyle said attacks on \u201crip-off\u201d degrees from the former prime minister Rishi Sunak risked putting off future innovators and scientists. \u201cWhere is the next generation of innovation going to come from? It\u2019s not going to come out of a sandwich shop,\u201d Kyle told the Guardian. Kyle, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, was able to attend university only thanks to a dramatic intervention by Anita Roddick, the founder of Body Shop. Roddick had urged Kyle to apply to university after spotting him working long hours at her company, and when he was rejected by Sussex University she threatened to return her honorary degree unless he was admitted. Kyle said: \u201cThe value of an undergraduate degree has been called into question by the previous government, and that is a psychological barrier. \u201cNot to people who come from affluent, assertive families but to people from lower incomes, for whom the consideration of money has a far more direct impact on their lives because their families live and breathe it every day. \u201cI don\u2019t know a single Tory [MP] who stood up saying that too many people are going to universities, who didn\u2019t want their own kids to go. I used to go around and ask them after I heard them say it. In one case, I asked one: \u2018Which one of your three kids did you not want to go to university?\u2019 \u201cThis is real. For me, you can imagine how personal this all feels. Because every time they say too many people go to university, that\u2019s me.\u201d Kyle said Roddick was the first person who suggested he should go on to higher education after he left school in Brighton with no qualifications and joined the Body Shop after applying five times. He said: \u201cThey gave me the lowest-paid job in the company, inputting invoices, which was the worst job in the world for me, because I only found out later in life I was so profoundly dyslexic. \u201cI was terrible at the job but loved the company, so I used to go in on a Sunday and work my socks off secretly so that I could stay up to date with everything. And that\u2019s how I met Anita, because she spotted me working on a Sunday.\u201d After Roddick suggested he go to university, Kyle applied twice to Sussex and was rejected each time, so he returned to his old school as a 25-year-old to gain the entry qualifications that he needed. \u201cThen I applied and I got rejected again. But a few days later, I then got an acceptance to Sussex. I only found out some time later, because her PA told me, that Anita had called the university, and said: \u2018If you don\u2019t have Peter Kyle as a student, I\u2019m returning my honorary doctorate.\u2019 That is how I got in,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen I look back at those times, I have no idea why I persisted. Most young people will take no for an answer the first time, and I feel very privileged for the education I got.\u201d Since 2015, Kyle has been the Labour MP for Hove and Portslade, and was appointed by Keir Starmer to cabinet as science and innovation secretary after the general election in July. Asked how the government would improve the financial plight of universities and students, Kyle said their struggles mirrored the UK\u2019s problems as a whole. \u201cWe have to get the fundamentals of the economy right because you can\u2019t fix any of these problems in singularity,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we could just put maintenance grants up by \u00a31,500 and think that would solve the problem of renting in a place like Brighton. It won\u2019t. The only way we solve the problem of renting in Brighton is to give more rights to tenants but also we are building more houses, which we are in Brighton, so that there are places that are tailor-made for people at all points in their lives. \u201cWe can\u2019t solve any of these problems in singularity because they are so interconnected.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-27T14:56:49Z",
            "content": "Wimbledon\u2019s controversial plans to build 39 new tennis courts have been given the green light after the deputy mayor of London ruled that the \u201cvery significant benefits\u201d of the scheme outweighed any potential harm to the environment. Speaking at the end of a three-hour public hearing at City Hall, Jules Pipe said it was right for the All England Lawn Tennis Club to be granted planning permission to expand from 41 to 115 hectares on the site of the old Wimbledon Park golf course. Campaigners had urged Pipe to reject the plans as it would lead to 300 trees being chopped down and the creation of a \u201ctennis industrial complex\u201d. They also pointed out that the site was on metropolitan open land, which usually requires \u201cvery special circumstances\u201d to build on. However Pipe insisted the scale of the benefits from the development, which include a new 8,000-seat show court as well as 38 other courts for a qualifying tournament and practice facilities, met such a threshold. \u201cThe proposed development would facilitate very significant benefits, including those to public open space and recreation, community, cultural heritage, ecology and biodiversity, economic, employment and transport,\u201d he said. \u201cThese would clearly outweigh the harm caused by the proposal and represent very special circumstances. For these reasons, I agree with the GLA [Greater London Authority] planning officer\u2019s recommendation and grant planning permission.\u201d The news was welcomed by the AELTC\u2019s chief executive, Sally Bolton, who said that Wimbledon hoped to have the new courts in place by the early 2030s. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic news,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some legal agreements to work through, but then we can look forward to delivering one of the greatest transformations since the London Games, which I think we\u2019re all very excited about delivering.\u201d Bolton insisted that being able to stage a qualifying tournament on site, rather than at the Bank of England grounds in Roehampton, three miles away, would \u201ccreate an exceptional three-week event\u201d with fans also able to watch the world\u2019s best players practise. Critics of the scheme reacted with disappointment and said the AELTC had failed to demonstrate how its purported economic benefits of over \u00a3300m a year would benefit the local community. And they also accused the AELTC of failing to properly consult residents before coming up with their proposal. Fleur Anderson, the MP for Putney, also warned that only 28% of the new area would be open to the public. \u201cLocal people are the losers in the deal,\u201d she said. \u201cWe knew we had a big fight on our hands to take on Wimbledon and to try to get them to listen but I am just so disappointed that this is going to go ahead. There is going to be such disruption of our very precious green space. But the fight doesn\u2019t end here.\u201d Once legal documents are signed, the opponents of AELTC\u2019s proposals will have six weeks to decide whether to take the case for judicial review and, potentially, the supreme court. One avenue for a challenge could be over a covenant signed by the AELTC in 1993 when it bought the golf course land from Merton council in 1993. \u201cCall me old-fashioned but I believe promises should be kept,\u201d Paul Kohler, the MP for Wimbledon said. \u201cIn 1993 the then-chairman of the AELTC, John Curry, said: \u2018We completely understand and support everyone\u2019s determination to keep the land open and we have purchased the land on that basis.\u2019 And in 2018 the AELTC also promised to deliver proposals with the local community. \u201cPeople don\u2019t trust public bodies. So my message is, let\u2019s keep our word.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-25T07:47:47Z",
            "content": "The most obvious point to make about Tanya Plibersek\u2019s approval of three coalmine expansions is this: the potential climate impact is substantial \u2013 much greater than what it has allowed to this point. Labor has been criticised for supporting new fossil fuel developments before, but the four coal developments it had backed prior to this were relatively small. They are expected to add about 156m tonnes of heat-trapping carbon dioxide to the atmosphere if fully developed. The new expansions easily dwarf this. According to the Australia Institute\u2019s coalmine tracker, by the time the last of them winds up in 2048 they could have released more than 1.35bn tonnes of CO2. That\u2019s globally significant \u2013 roughly what Australia\u2019s entire domestic economy is expected to emit over the next three years. The developments are at odds with the intent and spirit of the deal backed by nearly 200 countries \u2013 and loudly championed by the climate change minister, Chris Bowen \u2013 at the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai last December. That agreement called on all countries to contribute to global efforts to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems \u201cin a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade\u201d. Yes, the deal isn\u2019t binding and there is wriggle room in the wording, mostly to accommodate Russia and other petrostates that Australia would not want to be associated with. But the question for the Albanese government is pretty straightforward: how does a massive coal expansion lasting decades line up with what it has pledged on the global stage? Leaders of low-lying Pacific nations, in particular, might appreciate some answers. Less than four weeks ago, Anthony Albanese was in Tonga declaring his commitment to climate action at the Pacific Islands Forum, and explaining why Australia wants to co-host the Cop31 climate summit with island nations in 2026. As far as we know, allowing more than a billion tonnes of additional CO2 currently trapped beneath the ground to be dug up and burned didn\u2019t get a mention. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The government\u2019s position is more galling when you consider that the approval is for thermal coalmines to mostly feed overseas power plants. There is a case \u2013 albeit a contested case \u2013 that metallurgical coal used in steelmaking will have a longer life as alternatives are still coming online. This isn\u2019t the case with coal-fired electricity. While it won\u2019t end overnight, there are affordable zero-emissions replacements for thermal coal readily available, and it is an area in which a rapid transition is possible. The Albanese government expects Australia to be basically off it as a power source at home by 2035. Not every country has our renewable energy resources, but Australia could be doing more to help other countries accelerate in that direction. Backing large coal mining developments does the opposite to this. It further entrenches the polluting status quo. It works against the government\u2019s declared goal of keeping global heating since preindustrial times well below 2C and aiming for 1.5C. Plibersek\u2019s justifications for the approval decisions include that she is acting in accordance with national environment law and the emissions would be considered under the \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d, a policy meant to cap and reduce pollution at major industrial sites. Neither of these arguments stand up to scrutiny. The safeguard applies only to emissions within Australia. Coalmines leak greenhouse gases, but the overwhelming bulk of their climate pollution \u2013 more than 90% \u2013 is released when the coal is burned overseas, far from the domestic policy\u2019s reach. On environmental law, the government could rewrite the Howard government-era Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to introduce a climate impact assessment for new developments if it chose to. The Greens and key independents want it. The prime minister, under pressure from mining interests and some media on the issue, is opposed. It\u2019s a political choice. The government knows approving coalmines is a bad look. Plibersek puts out a media release when she blocks a coalmine or greenlights a renewable energy development. As we have noted before, the approval of fossil fuel developments tends to get a different treatment. No media release is published issued, and the decisions come in a group to minimise the number of negative stories. Addressing the climate crisis is challenging and complicated. The government sometimes gets frustrated with what it sees as a simplistic public debate about it. It thinks its opponents get an easy ride from the media and aren\u2019t held properly accountable for what they say. Sometimes it has a point. But it is the government. When it approves thermal coalmine developments of this size it should be frustrated \u2013 or more \u2013 with itself. It is undermining its own case that it is serious about the problem. Before the election in 2022, Albanese declared he wanted climate action to be his legacy. It seems unlikely this is what he meant.

            "date": "2024-09-19T19:18:59Z",
            "content": "It appears to be game, set and match for the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) in its lengthy battle to build 39 new courts on Wimbledon Park after the Greater London Authority recommended that the project should be approved. The proposals have been deeply controversial, with local residents warning of 10 years of disruption as well as the creation of a huge \u201ctennis industrial complex\u201d that would lie silent for much of the year. However, officers at the GLA recommended on Thursday that the deputy mayor should grant conditional planning permission at a public hearing on Friday 27 September. In the conclusion to a 221-page report, the officials said the project complied with most relevant planning policies and there were \u201cno material considerations that are considered to justify the refusal of consent\u201d. The report also said the proposal would bring in \u00a3336m of annual benefits and \u201cwould result in the creation of 40 year-round jobs and 256 Championships jobs\u201d. The AELTC has argued that it needs a third 8,000-seat show court, along with 38 other grass courts that would largely host qualifying matches and improved practice facilities, to ensure Wimbledon remains the world\u2019s pre-eminent tennis tournament. Residents have maintained it will cause environmental damage and a loss of green spaces on protected metropolitan open land (MOL). Merton council initially approved the plans, but the proposal was referred to the GLA after Wandsworth council rejected the scheme last November. The land in question straddles the two boroughs. The full planning hearing will take place at City Hall on 27 September, with a verdict potentially the same day. The decision will be taken by Jules Pipe, the deputy mayor of London, as the mayor, Sadiq Khan, excused himself from the process having publicly expressed his support for the plans in 2021. The planning officers\u2019 decision was welcomed by Deborah Jevans, chair of the AELTC, who said: \u201cWe believe that these plans will deliver one of the greatest sporting transformations for London since 2012. The land that we propose to enhance has been used as a private members\u2019 golf course for well over 100 years and, as a core part of this project, we will create 27 acres of beautiful new parkland, free for the public to access and enjoy.\u201d However, the Labour MP for Putney and Southfields, Fleur Anderson, along with local leaders, said they were \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by the report. \u201cThe AELTC plans as they currently stand are simply not fair for our constituents in Wandsworth,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will continue to work alongside local campaigners and residents to ensure that our case is made clearly.\u201d That sentiment was shared by Jonathan Morrish of Save Wimbledon Park. \u201cThe general direction of the report is not what we wanted and the admission of loss of open space and harm to protected MOL is deeply distressing to local residents whose views haven\u2019t been taken into consideration,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be out in force at the GLA meeting on Friday 27th.\u201d"

            "content": "It is the season for special pleading, meaning warnings to the chancellor of the dire consequences that will follow if she fiddles with various tax reliefs in her budget next month. In the case of London\u2019s junior stock market \u2013 once known as the Alternative Investment Market, but these days just as Aim \u2013 the chorus is becoming deafening. The \u201congoing viability\u201d of Aim would be threatened if 100% business relief from inheritance tax (IHT) is jettisoned, said Julia Hoggett, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, in a letter to the Treasury reported by Sky News. Stockbroker Peel Hunt thinks the likely initial share price reaction would be \u201ca drop of 20%-30% across the [Aim] index\u201d. Are these forecasts credible and should we care? The answer to the first question is yes. The entire capitalisation of Aim is about \u00a375bn and roughly \u00a311bn can be ascribed to investors who are making use of the current system that allows 100% relief from inheritance tax on shares held for at least two years. Approximately \u00a36bn is held in IHT funds and about \u00a35bn comes from direct investments by founders, families and individuals engaged in IHT planning. It feels plausible that the bulk of that money would head to the exit if the relief was removed. One IHT fund manager says he would be \u201ca forced seller on day one\u201d. His fund, like others, is set up to deliver a tax relief to investors; if it cannot do that, he has a duty to get out. Given that liquidity on Aim isn\u2019t strong under normal conditions, one can see how a rush would become a stampede. Selling would be \u201cfurther amplified by other investors in Aim-listed companies recognising the negative fund flow and deciding to move into other investments,\u201d argues Peel Hunt persuasively. But should the rest of us really be bothered about the removal of a tax break that, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies points out, distorts investment choices and has no inherent rationale? Removal, estimates the thinktank, could raise about \u00a31.1bn in year one for the Treasury, rising to \u00a31.6bn in 2029\u201330. Every little helps if, like Rachel Reeves, you need to fill a claimed \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d and have ruled out changes to income tax, national insurance, VAT and corporation tax. Actually, we probably should care. Aim\u2019s reputation as a lightly regulated casino may be deserved given the number of scandals and collapses that have occurred since its launch in 1995 (think Patisserie Valerie for a recent example) but, equally, one shouldn\u2019t forget about the hits. Fevertree, maker of tonics and mixers, listed a decade ago at a market capitalisation of \u00a3154m and is now worth \u00a3800m. Gamma Communications, a software and services business based in Newbury, has grown its market value tenfold to \u00a31.6bn over a decade. Learning Technologies, a workplace digital learning firm, has increased its market value from \u00a343m at listing a decade ago to \u00a3600m. In practice, many such success stories could transfer to the main London stock market without difficulty. But there would also be a chunk of family-backed businesses that would become easy prey at sunken valuations for private equity, which doesn\u2019t feel like an improvement. The point is that the end of Aim, or just a rapid descent into irrelevance, would cut off a source of funding for growing companies, which would jar with the government\u2019s \u201cgrowth first\u201d and pro-risk-taking message. For all of Aim\u2019s faults, companies have raised \u00a3135bn there since inception and there is a bias towards techie firms, which is usually deemed desirable. None of which is to deny the illogicality of the tax break. The case for survival is only the pragmatic one that sudden removal would create a funding hole in the universe of small- and medium-sized companies. If the relief has to be reformed, Reeves could make the process gradual, for example, by extending the two-year qualifying period or retaining existing rights. Nor is it to deny that Aim ain\u2019t what it used to be \u2013 it had almost 1,700 companies in 2007 and now only 700 or so. But that is also an argument for not clobbering it further."

            "date": "2024-09-15T13:03:18Z",
            "content": "The younger, tormented minister mulling his position before the Labour government granted Heathrow\u2019s third runway in 2009 might have been greatly relieved to know that, 15 years later, not a shovel would have touched the ground. But now, returning to power with a revamped energy and climate brief, Ed Miliband again finds himself in a cabinet which, many in aviation hope, may usher in bigger airports and more flights \u2013 as well as enough CO2 emissions to outweigh any new solar farms. Despite emerging victorious in political and legal battles over its plans for a third runway, Heathrow has dropped down the airport expansion queue. Among London airports alone, City has just been granted permission to expand passenger numbers by 40%, while Luton and Gatwick await ministerial decisions on large developments that would add huge numbers of flights. Net zero may still be the government\u2019s stated ambition, but the messages ringing louder in airport executives\u2019 ears are those from the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, stressing growth and planning reforms to get Britain building infrastructure again \u2013 particularly the type not funded by the battered public purse. A pre-election interview in which Reeves underlined she had \u201cnothing against expanding airport capacity \u2026 I back our airports\u201d was noted. Growth doesn\u2019t necessarily mean new runways. Airports\u2019 passenger capacities are often limited in original planning conditions, which several hope to amend. Bigger planes and extended flight hours, as well as reconfigured buildings and more efficient operations, can all bring more customers through. Manchester and Birmingham are growing with terminal renovations, while a large extension to Stansted\u2019s terminal follows the airport\u2019s legal victory in pushing its permitted capacity to 43 million passengers a year. Britain\u2019s operators might not yet have the brass neck of Ireland\u2019s Dublin airport which, its Ryanair-schooled CEO Kenny Jacobs announced last week, would simply be breaking its licensed 32m limit this year, and hadn\u2019t checked the sanctions. \u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted territory\u201d, Jacobs said. But the operators would certainly echo his accompanying sentiments: that bigger airports mean trade, jobs and growth. Jacobs claimed that meeting the threshold, by turning away a million passengers in 2025, would lose Ireland \u20ac500m (\u00a3420m) in visitor spending and cost 1,000 jobs. Similar figures are bandied around in south-east England by Gatwick, which has rebranded an existing taxiway as a standby \u201cnorthern runway\u201d as it seeks permission for the kind of expansion ruled out last decade by the Airport Commission. Tim Norwood, Gatwick\u2019s chief planning officer, said the runway plans \u201cwill be a major contributor to our airport\u2019s long-term growth and will deliver a significant boost to the region, by generating 14,000 new jobs and \u00a31bn for the economy every year\u201d. A planning inspector\u2019s report will land on the transport secretary Louise Haigh\u2019s desk in November, for a decision early in 2025. Before that, Haigh must rule on Luton\u2019s master plan to fly 32 million passengers a year, up from the current 19 million maximum, by adding a terminal and expanding into a neighbouring park. Paul Kehoe, chair of Luton Rising, the council-owned company that runs the airport, said the proposal would make \u201cbest use of the airport\u2019s existing runway and assets and play a crucial role in stimulating regional economic growth by enhancing trade, attracting investment and boosting tourism \u2013 generating an additional \u00a31.5bn in economic activity every year by the mid-2040s\u201d. It would bring 11,000 jobs at the airport, he added. Will these applications succeed? According to one industry source, \u201cThe mood music is positive \u2026 There\u2019s something in the air.\u201d And not just another jet to the Balearics. Labour\u2019s manifesto had none of the measures to curb aviation proposed by the Liberal Democrats or Greens, and decisions on these large privately funded infrastructure projects are expected to be led by the Treasury rather than the Department for Transport. Officially, all expansion has to meet the party\u2019s four tests, three of which are environmental: would a bigger airport harm air quality; increase noise; and still allow Britain to meet its climate change targets. But the fourth, whether it brings countrywide economic benefits, is the one that suddenly seems the most germane to policymakers. The industry insists that the environment will not be simply shunted aside for the economy. AirportsUK, the renamed trade body for the operators, said international flights were \u201cimportant enablers of economic growth, and will play an important role in delivering the government\u2019s ambition to have the fastest rate of growth in the G7\u201d; and that airport expansion \u201cwould directly create jobs, inject investment into all areas of the UK and stimulate trade and investment\u201d. But, it said, \u201cairports can expand while meeting net zero commitments\u201d and should be allowed \u201cto grow sustainably, subject to planning and environmental requirements\u201d. Most environmental groups, of course, disagree. Opposition to expansion has in no way been softened by the greatest current hope of \u201csustainable aviation\u201d: its eponymous fuels (SAF). Others argue that the economic arguments are fundamentally flawed. Alex Chapman of the thinktank the New Economics Foundation says: \u201cIf we are saying airport expansion drives growth, what is the mechanism? Typically most of the modelling suggests it is through business travellers and trade. But the statistics show that there has been no net increase in business travel since 2006, when capacity has grown dramatically. All the growth has come from the leisure market. That poses serious questions for those who argue airports deliver growth. It\u2019s not clear that residents flying overseas for holidays is of any economic benefit to the UK.\u201d Data published by Visit Britain this month showed domestic tourism declining by 5% year on year, with spending down 9%, hitting the regions hardest, as outbound trips boomed. A longstanding campaigner for Labour and on transport issues, who declined to be named, said: \u201cWithin a lot of Labour, there\u2019s a reflex belief in the voodoo economics pushed by the airports.\u201d Now though, he said: \u201cThere is another group of very senior Labour politicians who do understand the environmental implications, in a way ministers didn\u2019t 20 years ago.\u201d While the Ed Miliband of 2024 has rapidly approved massive renewable energy projects, Chapman warns: \u201cAll of that progress in terms of carbon emissions on onshore wind and solar is likely to be immediately wiped out by one or two airport expansions.\u201d And the shadow of the big one, Heathrow, looms again. Heathrow declined to comment for this feature, but its chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, said in July that the airport was hoping to get \u201cmore capacity out of the existing infrastructure\u201d, while also working on new runway plans. Paul Beckford, policy director at anti-Heathrow expansion group, Hacan, said: \u201cAll of these other south-east airport expansions combined don\u2019t equate to the size of Heathrow\u2019s expansion in its size or climate impact \u2026 Building Heathrow\u2019s third runway would be like plonking Gatwick next to the existing site.\u201d A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to securing the long-term future of the UK\u2019s aviation sector. \u201cHowever, all expansion proposals must demonstrate they contribute to economic growth, while remaining in line with existing environmental obligations.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-19T10:52:01Z",
            "content": "The new Champions League format has capacity to bruise egos. Few teams finishing bottom of a section of four are likely to invite ridicule. Coming 36th out of 36th, or anywhere close to the foot of this expanded section, will be optically embarrassing. Brendan Rodgers had his eyes fixed on making a European impact long before the Champions League was remodelled. Celtic have realised their domination in Scotland is \u2013 save wild mistakes, or a revolution across the city \u2013 virtually guaranteed. Broader horizons now, if belatedly, appeal. So they should; recent days revealed annual income of \u00a3124.6m, from which they spent \u00a3105.4m. Celtic reported \u00a377.2m in the bank, even before Matt O\u2019Riley\u2019s \u00a326m sale to Brighton. Umpteen clubs have competed in Europe on fractions of those figures. Celtic have strength, stability and an excellent manager, which all negate excuses. Wednesday evening and the 5-1 thumping of Slovan Bratislava was the standout occasion of Rodgers\u2019 second stint at Celtic. It mattered more than defeating a weak Rangers team at the start of the month or signing off from the last Champions League campaign with a win over Feyenoord. The significant element was that Celtic showed they could take the intense game that serves them so well domestically to another level. Rodgers was criticised in his previous spell for a lack of flexibility when stakes were raised. The Slovan fixture demonstrated his plan A can be perfectly effective in a world beyond St Johnstone. \u201cSometimes I think at this level, people can dress it up and think because you\u2019re playing in the Champions League that you might have to do something different,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cYou don\u2019t. For us it was really important not to complicate things. These are big \u2018belief\u2019 games and it\u2019s been really difficult over a long period of time for Celtic at this level. I want to change that mood and that feeling and we\u2019ve worked on that from the beginning of pre-season to get to this point where we can have that belief.\u201d The availability of good players helps, of course. Instant impressions of Arne Engels are that it will be a shock if Celtic do not sell the Belgian midfielder for considerably more than the \u00a311m they recently paid to coax him from Augsburg. Engels has mobility, elegance and attacking movement that bemuses opponents, and can deliver a wicked dead ball. The 21-year-old will be given status that would have been unlikely in the Bundesliga, hence this transfer makes sense. Celtic fans should enjoy him while they can. That midfield, also including Callum McGregor and either Reo Hatate or Paulo Bernardo, is Celtic\u2019s strongest suit. Kasper Schmeichel should be an upgrade on Joe Hart in goal. The displays of less-heralded players, namely Liam Scales and Greg Taylor, have improved since a summer transfer window which brought the arrival of stiff challengers for their positions. Celtic\u2019s strength in depth is suddenly striking. O\u2019Riley\u2019s departure has barely been noticed. The Scottish champions are not only entertaining to watch but press with a ferocity that illustrates Rodgers has complete buy-in from his players. Celtic were expected to beat Slovan but few could have predicted they would do so with such pace and swagger. Celtic\u2019s sharp progress \u2013 they are in a hugely better place than even nine months ago \u2013 is mutually beneficial. Rodgers has a curiously poor European record as a manager. Ange Postecoglou and Neil Lennon, in his second tenure, found it heavy going against foreign opposition. There was little point in Rodgers returning to the club solely to prevail in Scotland, having ticked that box long ago. The bar had to be raised. After the high point of beating Barcelona in 2012, it felt for too long as if Celtic banked European money without intending to have competitive relevance. If there is a flaw, it is that Celtic still concede more opportunities than may be healthy. The proof of that will soon arrive, their next Champions League outing taking them to Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday week. Later next month comes a trip to Atalanta. Later home matches against Club Brugge and Young Boys look the most feasible in respect of reaching the nine points that would surely earn a playoff berth for the last 16. That feels a legitimate target, which says it all about the formidable position Celtic find themselves in."

            "date": "2024-09-24T11:00:02Z",
            "content": "For the past two decades, Rudolph Walker has been a familiar face in the homes of millions of Britons, making nightly appearances as Patrick Trueman, the lovable rogue of Albert Square. During his time on EastEnders, Walker\u2019s character has taken on complex and prominent storylines featuring depictions of ill health and the sexual assault of his on-screen wife. That he has managed to do so as a black actor, born on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, who only arrived in the UK at the age of 20, could be seen as an endorsement of the progressive culture of British TV and its ability to nurture such a talent. But speak to Walker himself about better representation for black actors and there is a weariness to his language which betrays all too familiar frustrations. Progress, he says, is \u201cpainfully slow. There is still a lot that needs to be done. They\u2019re just touching the tip of the iceberg. \u201cI would like to see lots more actors involved, I\u2019d love to see more black producers, black directors as a result of the sacrifices that a lot of people made,\u201d he adds. Before the publication of his autobiography, Walking with Dignity, and his 85th birthday later this month, Walker spoke with the Guardian about his decades-long career as well as the struggles he faced along the way. One common talking point on his CV is the controversial 1970s sitcom Love Thy Neighbour. The show depicted the strained relationship between the racist character Eddie Booth, played by the late Jack Smethurst, and his Caribbean neighbour, Bill Reynolds. Despite criticisms for its portrayal of race relations in 1970s England, Walker says he is proud of the work and what it did for his own development. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been doing EastEnders if it was not for Love Thy Neighbour,\u201d he said. Looking back, he accepts the show has its critics but says he believes it displayed \u201cthe stupidity of racism\u201d during a time which cannot be compared with the present. From starring in a series that is held up as an example of how far attitudes to minorities have come on British TV, to taking part in an EastEnders special which made history as the first with an all-black cast (receiving almost 250 complaints in the process), Walker\u2019s work has spanned social and cultural changes both off and on screen. His fascination with drama began as a child but he never considered it a viable career. Raised by Carmen Bishop, a single mother of three, whom he says was a \u201cdisciplinarian\u201d, Walker came from a family that had little money and resources. \u201cAs a youngster, you never think in terms of poverty,\u201d he says. \u201cPoverty was never a word in our vocabulary. You survive, you live.\u201d When he left school, he was encouraged by the late Trinidadian actor Errol John to pack his bags and emigrate to the UK for a better chance in the industry. It was not an easy road because, as Walker describes, he was often not considered for roles because of his race. \u201cMy agent at the time would say, \u2018Rudy, they sent me the breakdown for this play,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201c\u2018There is a part there that I think you would do fantastically well. I\u2019m going to submit you for it.\u2019 And I would say, \u2018Yes, why not?\u2019 But of course the reply would come back: \u2018Sorry, it\u2019s not for a black actor.\u2019\u201d Following an appearance as PC Frank Gladstone alongside Rowan Atkinson in the sitcom The Thin Blue Line, in 2001 Walker secured the EastEnders role of mischief-maker Patrick Trueman, a character he actively shaped around his own cultural experiences. \u201cI was bringing a different culture, bringing Caribbean culture to the square. To me that was important,\u201d he says. \u201cA Trinidadian or Caribbean man from the old school \u2026 I based him on characters that I grew up with, so keeping money in their hats.\u201d It is Walker\u2019s commitment to diversifying the television industry that prompted him to create his foundation in 2009, which has supported 1,500 students in its arts projects so far. Walker says he hopes to see \u201csociety reflected\u201d within the industry and is working toward a more \u201cequal playing field in the future\u201d to inspire younger generations of actors. As for his future on EastEnders, Walker says he hopes to continue learning and growing, \u201ceven at the ripe young age of 85\u201d. He says: \u201cHere I am, 23 years after [joining EastEnders], still here. Enjoying every minute of it.\u201d"

            "content": "The new Labour government wants to inject renewed energy into the two-year-long international effort to set up a special tribunal with the authority to try Russia\u2019s leadership for the crime of aggression, the lord chancellor, Shabana Mahmood, has said. Discussions have been dogged by disputes over the appropriate body to set up the special tribunal, and fears in the US that if an organisation were empowered to strip the Russian leadership of immunity from prosecution in a foreign court, western leaders might face the threat of legal action in the future. The UK has been one of the driving forces in the core group of 40 countries looking to find a mechanism to hold the three Russian leaders \u2013 Vladimir Putin, prime minister Mikhail Mishustin and foreign minister Sergey Lavrov \u2013 to account. Mahmood told the Guardian that urgent action needed to be taken \u2013 not just on the military front but also in the legal sphere \u2013 over what has happened to Ukraine. \u201cWe want to inject some energy into the process because it has been going on too long,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to work this through very carefully, but at pace, to unlock what is the best mechanism to deliver the special tribunal.\u201d She was speaking on the eve of a meeting of justice ministers from the Council of Europe in Vilnius that will discuss how to progress the discussions on the format for a Nuremberg-style international tribunal that can secure global legitimacy. It is the first time that Labour in government has addressed the issue of putting Putin on trial for the invasion of Ukraine. Mahmood said she was aware there was strong support in Ukraine and elsewhere for the idea that the Council of Europe should take a central role in establishing a special tribunal. \u201cAs a new administration,\u201d she said \u201call options are on the table\u201d. She added that there was no dampening down of Ukrainian enthusiasm for this system of accountability to be set up. Alicia Kearns, the shadow Foreign Office minister, said this week that during David Cameron\u2019s tenure as Conservative foreign secretary, the international consensus had been leaning towards \u201ca special tribunal, held in a third country, established by a treaty between the Council of Europe and Ukraine, and supported by a wider membership through a vote in the UN general assembly\u201d. She called for a vote on the issue at the general assembly later this month, Mahmood said the government wanted to find a mechanism that \u201cdelivers, meets the legal challenges and is effective\u201d without slowing the process. She added: \u201cWe are very committed to the Council of Europe and the European convention on human rights, and that has never been more important than now because of what is happening in Ukraine.\u201d The case for a special tribunal has been pushed hardest in the UK by the human rights barrister Philippe Sands KC and the former prime minister Gordon Brown. It is argued that the route to a special tribunal through the United Nations security council is blocked due to the existence of the Russian veto, making the Council of Europe the best alternative. The international criminal court (ICC) is not in a position to try the crime of aggression, as opposed to individual war crimes, since neither Russia nor Ukraine have yet fully ratified the Rome statute that founded the ICC. Although the ICC has issued arrest warrants for Putin for his role in the abduction of Ukrainian children, and for the former defence minister Sergei Shoigu over the bombing of Ukraine\u2019s electricity infrastructure from October 2022 to March 2023, it is argued that it cannot try the three key members of the Russian leadership that directed the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, held talks with Mahmood this week. He has in the past questioned the value of a special tribunal if it duplicated the work of the ICC."

In 2016, 200 million girls and women worldwide had undergone FGM. Since then, 30 million more women have endured it. Most FGM cases \u2013 144 million \u2013 have happened in Africa, with a reported 80 million in Asia and 6 million in the Middle East. The rate of decrease has been slower than population growth in communities where the practice persists, and Unicef says that girls are also being cut at a younger age, reducing the opportunities to intervene. In Sierra Leone \u2013 where FGM remains legal \u2013 three girls have died in cutting ceremonies this year. There are no health benefits to the practice, which involves the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia. All forms are associated with increased long- and short-term health risks. Alarmingly, MPs in the Gambia initially approved an attempt to overturn a ban on FGM this summer. Almameh Gibba, the legislator responsible, said he wanted to \u201cuphold religious loyalty and safeguard cultural norms and values\u201d. The country would have been the first to reverse protective legislation, setting an alarming precedent: it took determined activism by campaigners to see off the threat. According to UN estimates, as many as three-quarters of Gambian women between 15 and 49 have undergone the practice. The rate in Sierra Leone is believed to be even higher. Legislation is necessary to protect girls, though enforcement and education are also crucial. The growing concern is that FGM is increasingly being medicalised in some places \u2013 performed by trained staff rather than traditional practitioners, with some communities apparently seeing this as a safer way to continue the custom despite the risks that exist even in a hospital setting. The mistaken belief that this is necessarily less severe, and prevents complications, may make parents more willing to go ahead. It is also less visible, with families and staff often claiming that a girl is undergoing a different procedure. Training healthcare workers about the damage it causes can help them not only to resist pressure to carry out FGM, and report it, but to shift attitudes. One study found that clients of antenatal clinics with staff trained to prevent FGM were themselves less supportive of the practice. Men as well as women need to be addressed and involved in anti-FGM activism. Promoting gender equality more broadly is essential, as is engaging with traditional, political and religious leaders to raise awareness of the harms: even families who disapprove of the practice may still subject their daughters to it for fear that they will otherwise be stigmatised. Such work is best led by local campaigners with external support. Survivors also need help in dealing with psychological damage and accessing reconstructive surgery. While several European countries have specialist clinics, the NHS does not provide it. Though prevention is the priority, those who have endured FGM need support too.

            "title": "Progress in heart disease treatment at risk after Tories\u2019 NHS failures, say experts",
            "date": "2024-09-08T13:53:48Z",
            "content": "Decades of progress in tackling heart disease and strokes risks unravelling in part because of NHS failures under the last government, a report into the state of the health service in Englandwill argue. The statistics on cardiovascular disease from the report by the eminent surgeon and Labour peer Ara Darzi, were released by the health department before its launch on Thursday. Ministers hope to both highlight what they see as the scale of their task over treatment of heart disease and strokes on the NHS, and to stress the importance of preventative measures to ease pressures on the service. Darzi concludes that while the age-adjusted mortality rate for cardiovascular disease dropped significantly for people under 75 from 2001 to 2010, \u201cimprovements have stalled since then and the mortality rate started rising again during the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d. A submission to the inquiry by the British Heart Foundation made a similar point: \u201cWe are extremely concerned that the significant progress made on heart disease and circulatory diseases in the last 50 years is beginning to reverse. The number of people dying before the age of 75 in England from CVD has risen to the highest level in 14 years.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Health and Social Care said: \u201cIt\u2019s alarming that the progress made on heart disease and stroke is now in decline. It points to a failure to help people stay healthy, and a failure of the NHS to be there for us when we need it.\u201d The report will set out significant regional disparities over treatment for cardiovascular disease, saying that while people in Surrey at the highest risk of a heart attack waited an average of less than 90 minutes for a procedure to unblock an artery, this rose to four hours in other areas, such as Bedford, Luton, and Milton Keynes. The report also points to the close correlation between poverty and the risk posed from the conditions, with under-75s in the most deprived regions of England 2.6 times more likely to die from heart disease than those in the richest areas, according to 2022 statistics. The opposition has pushed back against the idea seemingly implied in Darzi\u2019s report that it neglected the NHS in England when in government, arguing that this failed to take account of other societal and demographic pressures it faced. Victoria Atkins, the shadow health secretary, told Sky News that while ministers were \u201cchoosing the headlines they pick\u201d from the report, it was notable that it focused only on England and not Labour-run Wales, \u201cknowing full well that the health situation in Wales is far, far worse\u201d. She was scathing about Wes Streeting, the health secretary, saying: \u201cThe only thing he\u2019s done is to give junior doctors a pay rise with no productivity reform.\u201d Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Keir Starmer said Darzi\u2019s report showed \u201cthe last government broke the NHS\u201d, adding that \u201cour job now through Lord Darzi is properly understand how that came about and bring about the reforms\u201d. An initial tranche of the review\u2019s findings published this weekend highlighted how children are being let down by the health service. Streeting said the report would again highlight the much-discussed need for reform in the NHS. He told Sky News: \u201cI think what Lord Darzi, who is a very experienced clinician with decades of experience in the NHS and experience of serving both Labour and Conservative governments in different capacities, what he essentially says is the NHS is broken, but not beaten, and the investment matters, but so does reform. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t change the way that the NHS works as a system, then we will continue to see a heavy price for failure. \u201cThe reason why we asked Lord Darzi to do this report was, if you don\u2019t provide an accurate diagnosis for the patient, you\u2019re not going to prescribe the right treatment.\u201d"

            "content": "His father \u2013 as we know \u2013 was a toolmaker, and he has spoken often of the pebble-dashed semi where he grew up. But when Keir Starmer addressed the Labour party conference this week it was a less familiar aspect of his childhood that he chose to highlight. One of the things that had given him \u201cgreat joy\u201d as a child, \u201cas well as the football, obviously\u201d, was playing the flute, he told delegates in Liverpool. \u201cI don\u2019t think you were expecting that, were you?\u201d The instrument had given him \u201cso many opportunities\u201d, Starmer said, including his first ever trip abroad on a tour to Malta with the Croydon Youth Philharmonic Orchestra (CYPO). \u201cThese early encounters with art and culture, they change us for ever \u2026 But those opportunities don\u2019t go to every child, do they?\u201d For Andrew Turner, listening to the speech at home, it was an unexpected blast from the past. \u201cI was completely amazed \u2013 but it brought back lots of nice memories.\u201d Turner, who has recently retired after a career in technology, was an orchestral contemporary of Starmer\u2019s in the late 1970s \u2013 although as a viola player, he doesn\u2019t recall the big-haired future prime minister among the bank of flautists (\u201cto be frank, string players don\u2019t always talk to woodwind players\u201d). Given his own experience in the orchestra, however, \u201cI\u2019m not surprised he has mentioned it,\u201d says Turner, \u201cbecause I suspect for him, like for me, it was a formative part of his teenage years. Normally, other things that you do as a teenager are great fun, but this was something that really helped shape me.\u201d The extent to which music dominated Starmer\u2019s younger years has arguably been underappreciated in the countlesss profiles written about him this year. The most musically accomplished prime minister since Ted Heath played not only the flute but the violin, piano and recorder; from the age of 11 he was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music, catching the train alone every Saturday morning to the capital from his home in Hurst Green, Surrey. Starmer\u2019s Sunday mornings were then spent in rehearsals for CYPO, under the charismatic leadership of Arthur Davison, a former director and deputy leader of the London Philharmonic. It was, at the time, one of two youth orchestras in Croydon, reflecting its then well-funded music provision in local schools. Davison, a \u201clarger than life\u201d Canadian, was passionate about popularising classical music to wide audiences, and set high standards for his young musicians which also raised their expectations of themselves, according to his son Darrell, who is now also a distinguished conductor. \u201cHe would keep a really a tight ship, because he believed that they could produce really good music. There\u2019s something [about] an orchestra, almost a collective subconscious that sometimes helps you to play better than you thought you could.\u201d Perhaps, as a result, Starmer was far from the only member of the orchestra to go on to great things; another contemporary (on trumpet) was Matt Dunkley, now a leading conductor and arranger who orchestrated, among other things, the Barbie soundtrack and Billie Eilish\u2019s Bond theme No Time to Die. Dunkley says he frequently runs in to senior musicians who were CYPO alumni. \u201cIt created so many musicians who went on into the profession. But more than that, it created generations of children who had free access to music lessons and instruments.\u201d Things have changed in the 40 years since, according to Jon Regan, the conductor of CYPO\u2019s successor, Croydon Youth Orchestra, and the co-head of the music education provider Croydon Music and Arts. The more generous provision of the 1970s has long gone, he says, and though CMA is backed by the Department for Education and Arts Council England, \u201cwe\u2019re being asked to do more and more with less,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a lot of organisations around the country saying something similar \u2026 We can\u2019t reach out to as many people because of the funding cuts in both our sector as well as in schools.\u201d Starmer has said he \u201cpassionately\u201d wants to reverse the \u201cdegrading of creative arts and music\u201d in state schools; he now has the opportunity to do so. Dunkley agrees it is immensely important. Musicians he meets of his own and Starmer\u2019s generation are drawn from diverse backgrounds, he says, \u201cbut with the younger ones coming through it has become, again, a more privileged, middle-class thing \u2013 purely because of economics\u201d."

            "title": "Business leaders raise concerns over flagship Labour investment summit",
            "date": "2024-09-24T17:19:03Z",
            "content": "Business leaders have warned that the government\u2019s plans for a major global investment summit are in danger of falling flat, amid growing frustrations over high costs of involvement and its timing two weeks before the budget. As a central plank in Labour\u2019s proposals to drive up investment in Britain, the party pledged in the general election campaign to host the summit within the first 100 days of winning power to show that the UK would be \u201copen for business\u201d under a new government. The event was confirmed last month by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, for 14 October as a flagship opportunity for up to 300 senior business figures hosted by the prime minister. However, several business leaders at Labour\u2019s annual conference in Liverpool this week said it was at risk of failing to live up to its high-profile billing, because it would take place while ministers were still thrashing out the details of several major economic decisions before the 30 October budget. \u201cIt\u2019s the wrong way round,\u201d said Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of Make UK, which represents 20,000 manufacturing firms across the country. \u201cThere is a concern about the timing, coming two weeks before the budget. \u201cPeople will want to know what the government\u2019s priorities are before committing investment.\u201d One industry source said the government had only started to approach companies within the past two weeks about the event, expected to take place at a central London location \u2013 a hurried timescale for a major summit \u2013 with proposals to charge up to \u00a3250,000 for sponsorship. While questions remained over several economic priorities, they said the investment summit, as it was described to them by officials, could amount to spending \u201chundreds of thousands of pounds for a photo opportunity\u201d with Keir Starmer or King Charles. Government sources did not deny sponsorship costs, but insisted attendance was free of charge. Another industry source said company chairs and chief executives were unlikely to attend, with several large firms planning to send more junior representatives \u2013 including several large Wall Street banks. Government sources insisted they were having no problems in attracting senior figures, saying \u201chundreds of CEOs\u201d were flying in from around the world, and that attendance was being strictly limited. Reynolds told bosses on Monday he was struggling to manage overwhelming demand. It emerged last week that Larry Fink, the chief executive and chair of BlackRock, was being lined up to attend, according to Sky News, as the party battled suggestions it would struggle to attract the 300 industry leaders it had pledged. Speaking at Labour\u2019s \u00a33,000-a-head \u201cbusiness day\u201d, taking place alongside its main conference, Reynolds said: \u201cThe problem is not getting people to come, it\u2019s managing the interest. It\u2019s like planning a wedding.\u201d It is understood some ministers have privately questioned the summit\u2019s timing, because companies were still awaiting clarity on tax and spending priorities due in the budget. Business surveys this week show uncertainty over the budget is weighing on Britain\u2019s economy, amid criticism that Reeves\u2019 warning of the need for \u201ctough\u201d decisions was hitting confidence. However, it is thought it would be too late to change course, having promised the summit would form an important role in the government\u2019s first 100 days. The City minister, Tulip Siddiq, said at a fringe event that the timing was in part due to the impact of the snap election on government schedules. Labour sources also confirmed the government would not be ready to announce its industrial strategy ahead of the summit \u2013 a policy which business chiefs have said will be important for steering investment in the economy. It is understood a green paper will be published alongside the budget to consult on its proposals, before a full launch of the final plan early next year. A chair of the industrial strategy council, which is expected to oversee the policy, has yet to be appointed, amid reports that ITV chief executive Carolyn McCall had snubbed the opportunity. The government is also yet to appoint an investment minister to coordinate business decisions with government. Make UK\u2019s Phipson said companies needed clarity. \u201cKey appointments remain unannounced,\u201d he said. \u201cFor business to feel truly secure to make those longer term investments, meat on the bones of the industrial strategy must be a priority which comes at speed.\u201d Jonny Haseldine, policy manager at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the summit would still send an \u201cimportant signal\u201d that the UK was open for business, and that bosses could take the lead from Labour\u2019s outline commitments on tax. \u201cThe direction of travel from government is encouraging. But businesses, both in the UK and overseas, will be keen to see more detail on competitive planning and tax policies, in order to achieve much needed growth,\u201d he said. Chris Hayward, policy chair of the City of London Corporation, said the summit would be an important event to sell Britain to the world. However, he cautioned that ahead of the budget, a long-term global tax regime was required. \u201cTax is an important part of the equation: it\u2019s no good being in sell mode then around the world people say: \u2018Your tax rates are too high.\u2019 The government cannot resolve that immediately but it can set out a pathway, a course of action that will get us to a globally competitive position on business taxes.\u201d A Labour spokesperson said: \u201cThis government has hit the ground running, delivering the change the business leaders were crying out for including major planning reforms, action on late payments and setting up GB Energy. The urgent work of turning around our economy has begun and there is no time to waste on attracting investment to Britain, that is why we have committed to holding this summit in the first 100 days. \u201cWe are on track to deliver an ambitious programme bringing together hundreds of attenders representing the best of business from across the globe.\u201d"

            "content": "Amazon\u2019s cloud computing arm will invest \u00a38bn in the UK to build datacentres that support customers in London and the west of England, Rachel Reeves said on Wednesday. The chancellor said the investment, which it was estimated would create as many as 14,000 jobs at Amazon and in local businesses, was part of the government\u2019s \u201clong-term mission to boost growth, unlock investment and make every part of Britain better off\u201d. Reeves said the investment by Amazon Web Services (AWS) would generate employment in the company\u2019s datacentres and in the construction, facility maintenance, engineering and telecommunications industries. The news may, however, be overshadowed by the expected imminent announcement of the loss of 2,500 jobs at the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales despite a \u00a3500m taxpayer-backed rescue deal. AWS said it expected the investment would contribute \u00a314bn to the UK\u2019s national income, or gross domestic product (GDP), from 2024 to 2028. Reeves said: \u201cI am under no illusion to the scale of the challenge facing our economy. Two quarters of positive economic growth does not make up for 14 years of stagnation under the previous government. \u201cHowever, this \u00a38bn investment marks the start of the economic revival and shows Britain is a place to do business.\u201d The announcement was greeted with scepticism by the GMB union, which narrowly lost a battle with Amazon over union recognition at its Coventry warehouse in July. Keir Starmer had praised the campaign, calling it \u201cfantastic\u201d. The GMB general secretary, Gary Smith, said: \u201cNew jobs and investment are always welcome, but serious questions have to be asked over whether Amazon Web Services is a good company to celebrate. \u201cIt receives hundreds of millions in taxpayer cash, while often paying limited amounts in tax. Meanwhile, workers in Amazon\u2019s warehouses are treated appallingly and denied a voice\u201d AWS is under investigation by the UK\u2019s competition watchdog, the Competitions and Markets Authority (CMA), after an initial examination of the market for cloud computing services by the telecoms regulator, Ofcom, said it was concerned that the US firm could be using its market power to limit competition. Ofcom said last year that it was \u201cparticularly concerned about the position of the market leaders Amazon and Microsoft\u201d. Cloud computing, or the delivery of IT services such as data storage and computing power over the internet with a pay-as-you-go pricing structure, is widely used by businesses and has emerged as a significant piece of infrastructure in the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) models. AWS and Microsoft were accused by users of preventing them from switching or mixing and matching with rival cloud providers. AWS said in response to the CMA investigation that \u201cthe market for IT services is well-functioning, innovative, dynamic, highly competitive, and produces considerable benefits for customers\u201d. Amazon\u2019s better-known online retail business has faced criticism from trade unions over working conditions and alleged \u201cunion-busting\u201d tactics, which the company denies. The government has promised to make it easier for unions to organise in workplaces as part of its new deal for working people. AWS said it would not release the location of the new datacentres \u201cfor security reasons\u201d. The government said it was \u201cactively engaged in conversations\u201d with the company about investments in other parts of the UK."

            "title": "How Rachel Reeves could release billions more for investment in the budget",
            "date": "2024-09-27T04:00:03Z",
            "content": "Rachel Reeves is considering changes in next month\u2019s budget to the government\u2019s so-called fiscal rules, which govern how much it can spend. The changes are aimed at paving the way for billions of pounds more investment in the UK economy, to help decarbonise the economy and reboot growth. Reeves signalled the change in direction in her speech to the Labour party conference on Monday, saying \u201cit is time that the Treasury moved on from just counting the costs of investments to recognising the benefits too\u201d. But with government debt running at 100% of GDP, and a total debt pile of \u00a32.5tn, there are questions over how far Reeves could go. Would this break a manifesto pledge? Before the general election, Reeves pledged to meet two fiscal rules, which were largely unchanged from the self-imposed measures drawn up by her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt. The first manifesto pledge was that day-to-day spending would be balanced with tax receipts. Speaking at a fringe event at the party\u2019s annual conference, Reeves stressed this measure would be \u201cincredibly hard\u201d to meet and would still require the government to make \u201ctough decisions\u201d on tax and spending. \u201cThe \u00a322bn black hole in the public finances makes that even harder,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you carry that \u00a322bn forward for every year of the parliament, the previous government would not have met their fiscal rules, and we won\u2019t meet our fiscal rules, so that\u2019s why we have to take action at the budget in October.\u201d The second rule was that debt must be falling as a share of the economy by the fifth year of forecasts produced by the Office for Budget Responsibility. This is where Reeves is most likely to make changes. While this could break a manifesto pledge, the Treasury sees things differently: Reeves could argue she is changing the definition of debt, while still committing to bring down this alternative measure. Why does the Bank of England matter? One well-trailed idea is excluding the losses for the Treasury on the Bank of England winding down its crisis-era quantitative easing bond-buying programme. Experts say this could open up \u00a310bn-\u00a320bn of headroom. Threadneedle Street amassed bonds worth \u00a3895bn as it battled the 2008 financial crisis and Covid pandemic. However, they are now being sold for less than was paid, with the Treasury picking up the tab. Total losses could hit \u00a3100bn over the next decade. Reeves got a \u00a310bn boost earlier this month when the Bank announced it would sell \u00a3100bn of bonds over the next year \u2013 less than the OBR expected, and therefore crystallising fewer losses. However, excluding the losses altogether would add further headroom. Could the chancellor argue green investment should not add to debt? Reeves could exclude Labour\u2019s new public investment companies from the debt targets, allowing the chancellor to borrow as much for these vehicles as she thinks the market will have appetite to lend. Britain is an outlier compared with several countries that already do this with their state-owned energy companies. Sources said trade unions had briefed the Treasury on this, highlighting how Germany excludes the energy company Stadtwerke M\u00fcnchen. \u00d8rsted\u2019s borrowing is not included in Denmark\u2019s national figures, Vattenfall\u2019s debt is not counted by Sweden, and neither Statkraft nor Equinor feature in Norway\u2019s. Germany\u2019s state-owned development bank, KfW, is also excluded. This is because the Maastricht Treaty\u2019s definition of debt excludes publicly owned entities engaged in \u201ccorporate activity\u201d or \u201cmarket production\u201d, definitions which include the liabilities of savings banks, public utilities and waste management operators. Allies of Ed Miliband say the energy secretary has argued for keeping the new institutions off the government balance sheet, but that he is not part of the pre-budget decision-making process. Could Reeves change the debt target? Currently the fiscal rules target public sector net debt (PSND), which measures the stock of past borrowing and totals \u00a32.5tn. But this measure does not give any credit for huge swathes of assets that the state owns, from roads to public parks. Reeves could decide to target an alternative already tracked by the OBR: public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL), which take into account all financial assets and liabilities and totals about \u00a32.4tn. At the March budget, public sector net debt was forecast to rise, before a modest fall from 93.2% of GDP to 92.2% in the fifth year \u2013 meeting Hunt\u2019s fiscal rule with \u00a38.9bn to spare in cash terms. On the alternative measure, debt was forecast to drop in every year \u2013 including a significant drop from 80.6% of GDP to 78.7% in the fifth year, worth more than \u00a350bn in cash terms. The main source of difference is how public assets, on which the government would expect a future financial return \u2013 including student loans and equity stakes in companies \u2013 offset liabilities, such as government debt and public sector pensions. \u201cThe current debt target sets an incentive to sell off illiquid assets \u2013 like the student loan book \u2013 without regard for whether you get a good price for it, or whether you think the public sector, or private, are better placed to manage it in the long term,\u201d said Isabel Stockton, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank. However, there could also be challenges. \u201cIf that became your main fiscal rule, you\u2019d be concerned about the incentive for gaming the system \u2013 to organise more parts of public spending as loans.\u201d Could the chancellor go further? One of the most flattering possible measures Reeves could target is public sector net worth (PSNW), which includes non-financial assets \u2013 such as the road network, schools and hospitals \u2013 alongside financial ones. Using these assets to offset the government\u2019s liabilities, the measure currently shows a deficit of about \u00a3700bn \u2013 a considerably lower sum than Britain\u2019s headline \u00a32.5tn net debt pile. Taking this broad view could help show the value of investing in everything from buildings and roads to machinery, intellectual property and artworks. Economists at the International Monetary Fund praised the metric in July, saying it was \u201cmore conducive to public investment and economic growth,\u201d and could still act as an anchor that \u201cprecludes unsustainable debt dynamics\u201d. However, the measure could be tough to adopt, as non-financial assets can be difficult to value. Roads like the M4 motorway and buildings like No 10 Downing Street might be undesirable to ever sell, or to dispose of quickly. Expanding the scope of what the government counts under the measure could also bring in some unhelpful liabilities, such as PFI contracts \u2013 which have been deliberately taken off the government books \u2013 and unfunded pensions schemes. For these reasons, economists often argue PSNW should not be the main target a government adopts, but could be helpful as part of a wider set of measures because it could help to incentivise investment. Would there be a risk of a Truss-style market reaction? Part of the reason Reeves has stuck so neatly to self-imposed fiscal rules is for political reasons \u2013 to show voters that Labour can be trusted with the public finances. But it is also to demonstrate to financial markets that the new government is committed to avoiding a repeat of Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget. The Treasury has previously warned that any increase in borrowing is likely to increase inflation and interest rates, according to one official who has recently departed the department. The person added: \u201cI think officials will be a lot more comfortable with the Bank of England change than an open-ended allowance for the government to borrow as much as it likes to fund capital spending. Once you have carved out GB Energy, why not make it much bigger and load it up with debt?\u201d Jeremy Hunt, the former chancellor, tweeted on Thursday: \u201cMy advice from HMT officials was always very clear on this: more borrowing means interest rates stay higher for longer.\u201d However, the current fiscal rules have become increasingly discredited among leading economists. Stockton at the IFS said that frequent changes to the rules could alarm markets, but suggested some tweaks would be welcomed. \u201cIt certainly looks like keeping KfW outside the German debt rule doesn\u2019t impact the costs that Germany can borrow at. Investors seem fine with that,\u201d she said. Andrew Goodwin, chief UK economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said Truss had spooked markets after undermining the Treasury and the Bank of England, and by announcing large tax cuts that would have done little to boost the long-run potential of the UK economy. \u201cIt partly depends on the scale and type of loosening that Reeves employs after changing the rules, but I think the risk of a Truss-style event are very low,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Reeves were to use the extra headroom to boost investment, then I think markets would view that as a sensible choice.\u201d"

            "content": "The UK needs \u00a31tn of fresh investment over the next decade if the government is to hit its economic growth targets, a City taskforce has said. The Capital Markets of Tomorrow report, led by the City veteran and former boss of Legal &amp; General Sir Nigel Wilson, said that in order to achieve at least 3% annual growth, the UK would have to attract around \u00a3100bn of investment per year, divided between key sectors. That includes \u00a320bn-\u00a330bn towards the UK\u2019s housing stock, \u00a350bn for the energy sector, and \u00a38bn for water projects. It also calls for \u00a320bn-\u00a330bn worth of venture capital for growing companies that are beyond the startup stage and need more sustainable funding to expand. The report said the challenge was to make the UK \u201ca competitive market in which to invest\u201d. While many initiatives to boost investment in British infrastructure and companies were already under way, it stressed that the government and regulators needed to focus on creative opportunities and providing incentives for investors. \u201cThe global pitch needs to be levelled,\u201d it added. \u201cThere has never been such a large amount of money globally available and seeking investment opportunities,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cCapital pools include domestic and international capital sources, such as sovereign wealth funds, retail investment, private equity \u2018dry powder\u2019, and the UK is fortunate in that we have \u00a36tn of long-term capital within our pension and insurance industries. In other words, the supply of capital for growth is available.\u201d That includes creating new investment funds through an existing long-term investment for tech and life sciences (Lifts) initiative to attract private cash, and ensuring that the \u00a360bn-\u00a370bn per year of tax breaks for annual pension funds is applied in a way that encourages investment in UK companies, the report said. It also called for the reintroduction of tax credits on dividends received from UK companies, which was scrapped in 1997. Wilson\u2019s report stressed that the UK needed to kickstart a culture in which everyday consumers were far more keen to take risks and invest their money in British companies than to leave it languishing in cash accounts. That could be aided by axing stamp duty on share purchases, and allowing companies to nudge people with large cash savings towards investments. It called for a \u201cstreamlined\u201d UK ISA that would allow people to invest a certain amount of money in British stocks, tax-free. While plans for a British ISA were floated under the last Tory government, reports this week suggest that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is poised to mothball the project before the 30 October budget. The report was produced for the UK Capital Markets Industry Taskforce (CMIT), an influential body headed by the London Stock Exchange chief executive, Dame Julia Hoggett, alongside senior City figures including the bosses of the asset manager Schroders, the pharmaceuticals company GSK, the pension savings provider Phoenix Group and the venture capital firm Lakestar. Hoggett said: \u201cWe have a great base in the UK on which to build, including world-leading universities and a highly regarded financial services sector. But the opportunities need to be seized.\u201d Since its founding in 2022, CMIT has been pushing for changes to regulations that it believes have stifled investment, and have ultimately left the UK lagging behind the US in terms of developing capital markets \u2013 where money is raised for projects and companies \u2013 and economic growth. The group has also been sounding the alarm over the growing number of companies that have been leaving or snubbing the London stock exchange for overseas rivals, including the US. A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cThe chancellor has been clear that difficult decisions lie ahead on spending, welfare and tax to fix the foundations of our economy and address the \u00a322bn hole in the public finances inherited by the government. Decisions on how to do that will be taken at the budget in the round. \u201cWe have already taken action to reinvigorate our capital markets and boost growth, including by announcing a pensions investment review to drive more investment in homegrown business.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-02T05:00:26Z",
            "content": "The government is being urged to install trade union members on the board of its new \u00a37.3bn national wealth fund to help offset the influence of big banks and ensure that it is geared towards hitting green targets and bringing \u201cshared prosperity\u201d to the UK population. It is part of a wider set of recommendations set out by the campaign group Positive Money, aimed at shaping the governance and investment plans of the national wealth fund (NWF), which was launched by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, after the July election. The NWF is part of government efforts to attract billions of pounds of private-sector cash \u2013 roughly \u00a33 for every \u00a31 of taxpayer cash \u2013 for big infrastructure projects across the UK, including ports, gigafactories and hydrogen and steel projects. The government is hoping that putting \u00a37.3bn of public money forward will persuade private funders to put their own money on the line. While the government has yet to release further details of how the NWF will be run, Positive Money is concerned that the blueprint will be disproportionately influenced by City bosses. Labour has so far relied on a taskforce made up of the chief executives of firms including insurer Aviva and banks such as NatWest and Barclays, as well as the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney. The group said the fund should \u201cfocus on delivering for workers and communities, not just investors\u201d, and be governed by an independent board and investment committee with \u201cstrong representation from civil society\u201d \u2013 potentially including thinktanks such as the IPPR and climate strategists E3G \u2013 \u201cand, in particular, trade unions, to help ensure the NWF supports a genuinely just green transition and shared prosperity\u201d. It added: \u201cThese recommendations arise from what Positive Money sees as over-representation of the financial industry in the national wealth fund taskforce.\u201d The launch of the new wealth fund quickly followed Labour\u2019s controversial decision to cut its \u00a328bn green investment pledge in half \u2013 a move that prompted an angry response from green groups, unions and others. Positive Money said the NWF should aim to operate more like the much revered \u00a3580bn KfW development bank in Germany, but it would have to grow to more than \u00a3460bn to reach the same per-capita scale as its European counterpart. It said this could be done in part by giving the NWF powers to raise money by issuing bonds through financial markets, and have its borrowing be excluded from government fiscal rules that cap public sector debts, giving it more freedom to borrow and invest at scale. The campaign group said the NWF should devolve investment decisions to a network of 12 \u201cregional banks\u201d based in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland plus the nine regions of England, which would seek guidance from local authorities, as well as local industry and businesses, about how to allocate funds. Decentralising investment decisions would \u201censure funds are best channelled to where they are needed across the whole country\u201d. Simon Youel, head of policy and advocacy at Positive Money and author of the research, said Labour had an opportunity with the NWF \u201cto establish a long-lasting, legacy public institution\u201d. \u201cThe NWF isn\u2019t just an opportunity to deliver social and environmental value to the public after years of underinvestment. It\u2019s a chance for the public to finally start seeing some returns on their investment, instead of the \u2018privatised rewards, publicised risk\u2019 model that has become all too familiar in recent decades,\u201d he said. \u201cWith genuinely ambitious mandates, objectives and financing power, the NWF could join the ranks of purpose-driven public banks the world over, and demonstrate the potential of public finance to deliver truly transformative change, such as the rapid and just decarbonisation of our economy and infrastructure.\u201d A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cThe national wealth fund will play an important role in the government\u2019s industrial strategy and growth and clean energy missions, making transformative investments across every part of the country, supporting thousands of good jobs and making everyone better off, while generating a return for the taxpayer.\u201d The spokesperson added that further details would be set out in due course."

            "content": "Brazilians call overcast S\u00e3o Paulo their country\u2019s \u201cland of drizzle\u201d. But in recent months it has been raining punches not precipitation as Latin America\u2019s largest city endures what observers call the most violent and unruly election in its history. Physical violence has meant two recent debates ahead of the 6 October mayoral election ended with participants being treated in hospital and questioned by police. In the first case, Jos\u00e9 Luiz Datena, the celebrity host of a sensationalist crime TV show, lost his cool and walloped a rival for the mayoralty called Pablo Mar\u00e7al with a carbon steel stool. During a second debate, an aide to Mar\u00e7al \u2013 a far-right self-help guru and convicted fraudster \u2013 thumped an adversary\u2019s spin doctor, landing him in hospital where he required a Cat scan and six stitches to a face wound. Those attacks led the campaign\u2019s leading female candidate, Tabata Amaral, to deplore what she called \u201ca horror show of out of control and violent men\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a real shame for the city,\u201d complained Amaral, 30, a centrist congresswoman who said she had hoped for a campaign focused on education, healthcare and public safety, not bloodshed and brawls. The president of Brazil\u2019s top electoral court, C\u00e1rmen L\u00facia Antunes Rocha, echoed those comments, urging police and prosecutors to investigate and punish violence which she called an insult to voters and democracy. The 2024 election, Rocha complained on Tuesday, had witnessed \u201cthe most contemptible and criminal scenes, which had reduced politics to episodes of pugilism, irrationality and police reports\u201d. The fisticuffs have caused anger and bemusement, but also a hint of titillation among S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s 11 million-plus citizens \u2013 and made global headlines. \u201cBrazilian Politician Upends Debate by Hitting Opponent With Chair,\u201d the New York Times declared in its report about Datena\u2019s \u201cstunning\u201d on-air assault on Mar\u00e7al which came after the latter called the former a coward. The British tabloid the Sun invited readers to watch footage of \u201cthe WWE-style brawl\u201d. One political journalist, Jos\u00e9 Roberto de Toledo, said that in nearly 40 years covering S\u00e3o Paulo elections he had never witnessed such ignominious scenes as the weaponisation of furniture. But Toledo, whose podcast, A Hora, is chronicling the slugfest\u2019s political implications, challenged the generalization that S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s election was in itself violent. Rather, Toledo believed the turmoil was the handiwork of one man \u2013 Mar\u00e7al \u2013 a controversial social media whiz and populist provocateur who many accuse of deliberately stirring up trouble in order to attract attention and win votes. \u201cThis phenomenon has a name [and] a surname \u2026 It\u2019s called Pablo Mar\u00e7al,\u201d said Toledo, describing how the multimillionaire rightwing influencer goaded rivals into verbal or physical confrontations he hoped would go viral. \u201cHe\u2019s the violent element in this election,\u201d Toledo added. \u201cIf you take him out of the picture, everything\u2019s normal.\u201d The attention-grabbing tactics employed by Mar\u00e7al, a 37-year-old often portrayed as a more provocative version of Brazil\u2019s far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, have been shocking, even for a nation accustomed to Bolsonaro\u2019s brash behaviour. In recent weeks Mar\u00e7al has relentlessly harassed and smeared opponents and journalists during media appearances, calling them pussies, wimps, lame arses, crypto-communists, scumbags, mental retards and orangutans. He has also made a series of baseless insinuations about his rivals, suggesting, without evidence, that one was a cocaine user and another a rapist. In July, Mar\u00e7al went so far as to suggest that Amaral was responsible for her father\u2019s suicide \u2013 a slur she called a \u201cdirty, filthy lie\u201d and for which he later apologized. Toledo said Mar\u00e7al\u2019s aggressive rhetoric and mastery of the dark arts of social media had helped him commandeer a significant chunk of Bolsonaro\u2019s electorate. Bolsonaro has endorsed S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s incumbent rightwing mayor, Ricardo Nunes, but polls suggest many Bolsonaristas will vote Mar\u00e7al. \u201cPablo Mar\u00e7al has broken Bolsonaro\u2019s hegemony over the radical right,\u201d Toledo said. Mar\u00e7al looks unlikely to win the election, despite dominating headlines and boasting about 20% of intended votes. Polls indicate that about half of voters oppose a politician whose past run-ins with the police have been widely documented in the media. In 2010, Mar\u00e7al received a four-year prison sentence for allegedly being part of a cyber gang that used malware to steal money from banks. (Mar\u00e7al, who denied knowledge of the criminal racket, reportedly avoided jail thanks to the statute of limitations). A run-off between Nunes and Guilherme Boulos, a leftist congressman supported by President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, looks likely. But Mar\u00e7al\u2019s incendiary style of politics looks set to linger, with the influencer tipped to run for Brazil\u2019s 81-seat senate in 2026. Amaral, who is polling in fourth place, behind Nunes, Boulos and Mar\u00e7al, decried how such a \u201cdespicable character\u201d was hogging the election limelight. \u201cI find it utterly absurd that such a person is being considered [for mayor],\u201d she said, pointing to Mar\u00e7al\u2019s criminal past and reports \u2013 which he denies \u2013 linking close allies to organized crime. One of the culprits for his success, Amaral thought, was social media, whose algorithms allowed such rabble-rousers to thrive. \u201cWe need to regulate the social networks in Brazil,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2024-09-10T04:00:36Z",
            "content": "They travelled at night, for what seemed like hours, but it was difficult to tell. Yonas was blindfolded and drowsy from the Xanax he had been given. He wasn\u2019t sure where he was, but he could smell salt in the air when the car stopped. Yonas heard Ali, the other passenger, wind down his window and light a cigarette. The driver sat motionless, breathing heavily. Several minutes passed in silence. Then Yonas heard a pinging noise. Someone\u2019s phone had received a message. The door next to Yonas was opened, and two men escorted him into a building. After they took off his blindfold, the men walked down a long corridor and took the stairs to the basement. There, Yonas entered a room where a man dressed in blue scrubs was talking to Ali, the broker who had brought him here. He assumed the other man was the doctor who would perform the surgery. Before Yonas could ask any questions, he was taken to another room where he was told to change into a surgical gown and wait for a medical attendant to prepare the anaesthetic. As he waited, Yonas thought of his parents at home in Eritrea, his younger brother conscripted into military service, his sister destined to a life of servitude. He hoped his sacrifice would help them. The attendant came in. The needle scratched his arm; fluorescent lights gave way to darkness. Yonas had made three attempts to reach Europe, twice from Libya and once from Egypt. But each time he was detained and forced to pay large sums of money \u2013 between $3,000 and $7,000 \u2013 for his release. Destitute and already heavily in debt, Yonas borrowed money from lenders in Cairo. He was under pressure from his creditors, who were threatening to call in their debts, with force if necessary. But above all else he was desperate to send money back to his family in Eritrea. Trapped in a spiral of debt, he traded the only thing of value that he had: one of his kidneys. It is illegal to buy or sell an organ anywhere in the world, with the exception of Iran. Nevertheless, estimates suggest that around 10% of organs for transplantation come from illegal sources. Most cases, however, go unreported, so the true number is likely to be much higher. Several countries, including Pakistan, Egypt, Bangladesh, India, Turkey, the Philippines and China, have been identified as centres of organ trafficking, but the trade in organs is a transnational operation. In its 2018 Global Report for Trafficking in Persons, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime identified more than 700 cases of organ trafficking, the majority in the Middle East and north Africa. A 2021 Interpol report claimed that organ trafficking was of particular concern in north and west Africa, \u201cwhere impoverished communities and displaced populations are at greater risk of exploitation\u201d. According to the Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation (GODT), only 10% of the global demand for transplants is met each year. Increased demand for kidney transplants, in particular, has been exacerbated by a shortage of altruistic donations and limited access to transplant services. This has led to an increased dependence on criminal networks that obtain organs from vulnerable individuals. There is a black market for organs including kidneys, corneas and liver lobes. Rising demand for kidneys is partly a result of the spread of so-called diseases of affluence \u2013 diabetes, hypertension, obesity \u2013 and the subsequent rise in kidney failure. According to the charity Kidney Care, in the UK, the waiting list for a kidney transplant has increased dramatically since the pandemic. Consequently, more people are travelling overseas for transplant surgery. In many countries that attract transplant tourists, kidneys are sourced from the bodies of the poor and disenfranchised. As a legal academic, I have been investigating the global trade in organs since 2014. Over the past 10 years, I have spoken to 43 people from Sudan, South Sudan and Eritrea who sold a kidney out of economic necessity. In most cases, people were targeted by criminal groups because of their precarious status as asylum seekers, refugees or undocumented migrants. Most were not paid what they were promised. Some were paid nothing. Doubly criminalised, as illegal migrants and organ sellers, they were in no position to negotiate a price, or to ensure they got paid the agreed amount. Because of their precarious legal status they were also less likely to report abuse to the authorities. In the absence of legal pathways to migration, many had sold their kidneys after they had been arrested, detained and in some cases deported back to countries where their lives were under threat. Most had opted to avoid refugee camps, describing them as \u201cprisons\u201d and \u201cdeath camps\u201d where people go to die. They were disillusioned with the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). It was better to risk crossing the Sahara, Yonas told me, than to live under permanent surveillance, captive and dependent on a broken asylum system. Many, like Yonas, had expended all their resources trying to reach Europe and claim asylum. Categorised as illegal and pushed to the margins of society, they were exposed to exploitation of different kinds. The illicit networks that supply organ markets depend on the close cooperation of medical doctors. Criminal intermediaries are involved in the negotiation of fees, and the preparation of official-looking paperwork presented as evidence of informed consent to an altruistic donation. These brokers, who connect sick patients with impoverished and vulnerable \u201cdonors\u201d, also form long-term partnerships with medical professionals. Without the involvement of surgeons who perform illegal transplants for profit, the trade in organs would cease to exist. In March 2023, the UK tried its first organ-trafficking case. A Nigerian politician, his wife and their broker were found guilty of conspiring to bring a man to the UK from Lagos to obtain his kidney for transplant. The judge said in sentencing: \u201cThe trafficking of people across international borders to harvest their organs is a form of slavery. It treats human beings, and their body parts, as commodities to be bought and sold. It is a trade that preys on human poverty, misery and desperation.\u201d Unfortunately, as war and climate crisis displaces more people, there is no shortage of desperate people to prey on. * * * Yonas was conscripted into national service in Eritrea at the age of 14. He was sent for educational training at the Sawa Defence Training Centre, a sprawling military complex in western Eritrea notorious for its military-style discipline, physical punishments and forced labour. \u201cMy brother was with me,\u201d Yonas recalled. \u201cThey tried to brainwash us. They don\u2019t want people to have political ideas, thoughts. I had to escape that place.\u201d One night in September 2012, Yonas made a break for freedom. His family had paid a smuggler to take him across the border into Sudan, and there was a truck waiting for him on the far side of the compound. To reach it, Yonas had to crawl on his hands and knees, under wire fencing and across jagged rocks, avoiding the searchlights sweeping from above. He knew that if he was caught, he would be shot. Outside an old garrison town close to the border, Yonas climbed on to another truck heading to the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. In Omdurman, the twin city of Khartoum on the opposite side of the Nile, he was introduced to a smuggler who, he was told, could organise transport across the Mediterranean. The journey was expensive and dangerous, but Yonas felt he had nothing to lose. His family had given everything they had to help him escape Sawa; he was determined to make it to Europe and pay them back. Yonas had heard stories of kidnapping on migrant routes, but this smuggler had a good reputation, and Yonas was hopeful that he could make it. After a long and difficult journey across the Sahara, between Sudan and Libya, Yonas was delivered to the Mediterranean coast, outside Tripoli, as agreed. In April 2018, he was shoved on to a small boat along with about 100 other migrants. They were from different parts of Africa \u2013 Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Chad and Nigeria. One of the passengers, with no experience of sailing, was handed the responsibility of manning the boat. After about an hour, the engine cut out. Men, women and children sat helpless, dehydrated and fatigued, as the boat floated idly. Six hours passed before the Libyan Coast Guard intercepted the vessel and took them back to the African mainland for processing. They were told they would be detained for attempting to enter Europe illegally. After the engine had cut out, Yonas recalled, the passengers thought they might die. \u201cAnd when the coastguard came,\u201d he said, \u201csome of us wished we had, because we knew where we were going.\u201d Libya\u2019s immigration detention centres, which are partly funded by the EU, are notorious. Detainees have been subjected to torture, harassment, physical violence, sexual exploitation and forced labour, with no formal registration, no legal process and no access to lawyers or any judicial authorities. Yonas never spoke to anyone from the UNHCR or the International Organization for Migration (IOM) when he was detained. \u201cI think someone like this came to visit,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they just look around.\u201d In the absence of legal process, the only way to escape the punishing conditions of detention centres is to pay the officers a bribe. \u201cWhen the guards receive the money, they leave you in the desert. Then you just try not to get picked up [arrested] again,\u201d Yonas said. Yonas had left some money with friends in Egypt in case of an emergency. He also had relatives living in Sweden, the Netherlands and the UK, who raised funds to help him pay his way out of detention in Libya. \u201cThe money was sent to a Libyan bank account via Western Union,\u201d he said. He said he paid the prison guards around $7,000. After he was released, Yonas travelled to Cairo. By the time he had bought his way out of detention in Libya, Yonas had exhausted the funds he received from friends and family. Once in Cairo, he borrowed 30,000 Egyptian pounds (around \u00a3470) from lenders \u2013 a temporary measure, he thought, to cover the cost of food and accommodation while he searched for work. Two months went by. Yonas could not find reliable employment, and he was unable to make any repayments. He knew that if he missed his next payment, there would be serious consequences. \u201cThis guy [a debt collector] told me that he would take a tooth for every payment I missed.\u201d * * * Yonas had all but given up hope of reaching European shores when he was approached by a Sudanese man, who gave his name as Ali, at a street market in Cairo. Yonas told him his story. Ali said that he knew a way that Yonas could pay back all his debts and secure a place on a more reliable fishing vessel crossing from Egypt to Italy. He told Yonas he could sell his kidney, make a lot of money and save a life in the process. Yonas had his doubts. But he had amassed significant debts trying to cross the Mediterranean and he was coming under pressure to pay back friends, family and moneylenders. \u201cThis is the last thing you want to do,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut for me there was no other way.\u201d Ali, the broker, was personable and seemed genuine. Yonas agreed to the deal. He was promised $10,000 for his kidney. The money, he hoped, would be enough to cover his debts and pay for his onward journey across the Mediterranean. The surgery took place at a medical facility near Alexandria in November 2018. \u201cI remember waking up and feeling confused,\u201d said Yonas. The first thing Yonas he was aware of was a buzzing noise coming from a loose lightbulb, like the sound of a trapped insect. Next came pain, then fear, panic, anger. \u201cI was shouting as loud as I could. I just wanted to get out of there.\u201d Yonas rolled over and vomited on to the floor. Hours passed. Finally the door opened and a man holding a clipboard came in. The man told that Ali would be coming soon, at which point he could leave. He handed Yonas two painkillers and a glass of water, and slid out the door before Yonas could ask any questions. When Ali finally appeared, he told Yonas to get dressed. His voice was hard, all his old charm now gone. A nurse removed the drip attached to Yonas\u2019s hand and two heavy-set men escorted him back to the car. Yonas spent the next two weeks in an apartment in Cairo convalescing. He was closely monitored, in case he should decide to leave the apartment. They did not want him to attract attention. If someone were to see him, they might report his presence to the police. Best to keep him hidden while he healed. Yonas had been promised $10,000, but he was given just $6,000 in notes. This would just about pay off his existing debts, but it was not enough to cover the cost of smugglers\u2019 fees ($3,500) for the next stage of his journey, across the Mediterranean. Yonas went to the police and reported Ali for trafficking. He was trying to explain that he had been deceived into selling a kidney when another officer entered the room. The second officer informed Yonas that it was a criminal offence to sell a kidney. He took out a notebook and asked Yonas for his identification papers. Yonas fumbled in his pockets, searching for documents he knew he didn\u2019t have. The officers joked that Yonas didn\u2019t look like an Egyptian, remarking on his dark skin and curly hair. If he was a refugee, they suggested, he should go and complain to the UNHCR. But maybe he wasn\u2019t a refugee. Maybe he was an illegal migrant. The second officer reminded Yonas he could be arrested or deported for failing to produce his identification papers. Yonas was regretting going to the police. He looked around, nervously waiting for someone to speak. The second officer smiled scornfully and told him to leave. * * * In my research, I wanted to learn more about how the trade in organs was organised, and how brokers rationalised what they were doing. As it turned out, certain brokers were aware of my work. Some of them wanted to meet me, to ask me about it, and to explain their perspective. The brokers I interviewed did not necessarily see what they were doing as wrong. If anyone was to blame, they said, it was the doctors who knowingly performed illegal transplants. For the most part, they saw themselves as service providers, part of a supply chain for an already corrupt medical system. To them, it was just business. I met Hakim in Egypt in February 2020. He had been introduced to the brokerage business after getting into financial difficulties. \u201cMy uncle took me under his wing,\u201d Hakim told me. His family was from Khartoum, and his uncle was an established organ broker, with connections to doctors and transplant units in Egypt and overseas, mainly in Saudi Arabia, Oman and the UAE. Hakim said that his uncle introduced him \u201cto all the top guys, the doctors and other mediators [brokers] who work with the clients\u201d. The clients were transplant patients, some from Egypt, and others from across Europe, the Middle East and North America. When I met him, Hakim was based in Cairo and was responsible for recruiting donors and referring them to his uncle. At the time, March 2004, the central government in Khartoum, supported by the Janjaweed militia, had launched a brutal counter-insurgency campaign against rebels in Darfur, killing hundreds of civilians and displacing thousands more. Amid the chaos, Hakim saw an opportunity for recruitment. He contacted smugglers in Khartoum, many of whom had connections with border officials on the Sudan-Egypt border, who had the power to let migrants through in exchange for payment. The brokers started to solicit people fleeing the fighting who might be desperate enough to sell a kidney. \u201cI thought: they are in a very difficult position,\u201d Hakim said. \u201cMaybe they will sell a kidney for $5,000. Someone in Cairo will ask for more.\u201d Around the world, the cost of a transplant on the black market ranges from $20,000 to $200,000 \u2013 the higher price generally reflecting better treatment and care. The \u201cdonor\u201d typically receives a fraction of this cost. The amount that they receive varies from country to country. In the Philippines and Colombia impoverished farmhands and bonded labourers have been documented as receiving less than $2,000 for a kidney. In contrast, kidneys have been sold for between $10,000 and $20,000 in Israel and Turkey. In Egypt a kidney can sell for anywhere between $5,000 and $20,000. Patients, or \u201ctransplant tourists\u201d, pay between $50,000 and $100,000 for a kidney transplant, including travel and accommodation. The price generally depends on market demand. For a kidney, the price paid to the seller can be anywhere between $5,000 and $20,000. Part of the broker\u2019s job is to find out just how wealthy the buyer is, and to establish the absolute minimum the seller is prepared to accept. An impoverished, unemployed seller with no legal status is in no position to negotiate. For this reason, illegal migrants make valuable targets. A series of drawn-out conflicts in the region have supplied a steady flow of people whose desperation can be commodified in different ways: bodies to be smuggled, sold or harvested. Hakim said that he referred between 20 and 30 sellers a week, who are themselves referred to him by his contacts in Khartoum. \u201cThey agree the deal [organ sale] in advance, and I call my uncle to receive them. After the operation, they continue to the coast to try and make the crossing,\u201d he said. Most, he said, don\u2019t make it across the Mediterranean. I asked whether he felt any remorse for the people he was exploiting. \u201cYes, I feel bad for them. But I always give them their money. There are other brokers who would agree with you on a price, then disappear after the surgery without paying you,\u201d Hakim said. \u201cThis happens at least 40% of the time.\u201d Most people are not paid what they are promised, but because it is illegal to sell a kidney there is little they can do. Brokers and the medical professionals they work with are aware of this, using the threat of criminal prosecution to silence their victims. I met Hiba, a young single mother from Sudan, in Cairo in March 2020. She sold her kidney to help support her young daughter. She had been promised $10,000, but was paid $4,000. After she recovered from the surgery, she went back to the hospital to get her money. But prior to the surgery, she had signed documents that stated she was donating her kidney for free. This was enough to give those involved with the surgery legal cover. And now, if Hiba chose to report them to the police, she could be arrested for the criminal offence of selling a kidney. She was powerless to get the full fee she\u2019d been promised. One reason that worldwide convictions for illicit organ removal are so rare is that victims are reluctant to come forward. Another is systemic corruption. Hakim suggested that doctors pay bribes to protect themselves from police investigations. But he added, a little vaguely: \u201cThe doctors are not controlling the business. The people who control this business take a commission from the doctors. You don\u2019t know them or what they do. You just know that those people take a commission from doctors, they control the business [the organ trade] \u2013 otherwise, no doctor would be able to work [performing transplants].\u201d When I asked Hakim if he meant government officials, he simply replied, \u201cThey are people higher up.\u201d The threat of arrest, Hakim claimed, acts as a form of official extortion. Corrupt medical professionals, performing illegal transplants, who pay for protection will not be investigated, while those who refuse to pay could be arrested. * * * Three years later, in March 2023, I met Hakim again in Khartoum. I was following up on reports from contacts in Egypt who claimed that people, mostly from Darfur, were being trafficked from Khartoum to Cairo for organ removal. They were being promised safe passage across the Mediterranean, part of a \u201cgo now, pay later\u201d scheme. But when they arrived in Cairo, they were forced to give up a kidney as the price for continuing their journey. I wrote to Hakim on WhatsApp to see if he knew anything about this. He replied, \u201cIf you want to talk, I am in Khartoum now. I don\u2019t speak about this on the phone.\u201d I don\u2019t know if it was for dramatic effect, but he arranged to meet me at a graveyard close to Tuti Island, where the Nile divides. We discussed the mounting tension between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The following month, violent street battles would break out between these two factions, a conflict that quickly exploded into a devastating civil war, which continues to this day. According to figures released by the IOM, more than 10 million people have been displaced in Sudan. All are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. \u201cHow has business been?\u201d I asked Hakim. \u201cMore people are coming now, with the fighting,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these people will try to go to Libya. Others will try and make it [across the Mediterranean Sea] from Egypt, but this is more difficult. So, they can sell their kidneys,\u201d he said. Hakim denied any knowledge of human trafficking for organ removal, saying that in times of conflict people are forced to do things they would normally never do. The ongoing war in Sudan and the ensuing humanitarian crisis has pushed people to the brink. At the borders of conflict zones, selling a kidney is becoming a currency of last resort for people seeking refuge. In June 2023, I managed to contact two young Sudanese women who had fled the fighting in Khartoum. In April 2023, Rania was with her friend Fatima, both students at the University of Khartoum, when the RSF raided the main campus, on the banks of the Nile. \u201cWe were trying to hide from the fighting,\u201d Rania told me on the phone. \u201cThere were a lot of [female] students there who were afraid to leave. We thought we would be safe, but they found us and forced us to have sex with them.\u201d Soon after that they packed up their belongings and took a bus heading towards the border with South Sudan. They had heard the route south was cheaper than trying to go north to Egypt, and Rania had a brother living in Kampala, Uganda, whom they hoped to join. It was a seven-day journey from Khartoum to Renk, a small town in South Sudan close to the border where thousands of people had set up temporary camps in bleak conditions. A lack of food, water, healthcare and sanitation had left people at increased risk of disease, malnutrition and violence. There were hundreds of new arrivals each day. \u201cPeople are crammed together under tarpaulins,\u201d Rania said. \u201cThere are mosquitoes everywhere. There\u2019s not enough food, water, soap. Everyone is desperate for assistance. It\u2019s chaos.\u201d When Rania and Fatima arrived at a makeshift camp on the outskirts of the town, they were approached by soldiers in plain clothes selling tickets for flights from a small airstrip outside Renk to South Sudan\u2019s capital, Juba, and the city of Nimule. The flights, which should form part of the humanitarian corridor, are being controlled by armed militias charging exorbitant fees to board them. \u201cThey wanted a lot of money,\u201d Rania said. \u201cThe price would go up every day. They said if we didn\u2019t have any money we could have sex with them.\u201d When they refused, they were told there was something else they could sell: a kidney. \u201cThey said that this was the only way we were going to get a flight out of here,\u201d Fatima said. \u201cThere were two men who had agreed to this [selling a kidney], but I don\u2019t know what happened to them. I was worried that they would kill me and take my kidney.\u201d Two weeks after Rania and Fatima first arrived in Renk, they messaged me from Kampala. \u201cWe received some money from family members in Uganda. They paid a smuggler $500 to take us to Kampala.\u201d Rania said. \u201cThere were no humanitarian agencies or government officials transporting people. The drivers, the militias, they are exploiting people every step of the journey.\u201d In Renk, they had watched as large trucks carried hundreds of people further south to transit camps that were rumoured to be less crowded and better resourced. Others boarded cramped and overcrowded boats down the Nile to the city of Malakal, from which they would attempt to reach Juba, 970km to the south. Each stage of the journey would come at a cost. \u201cWe are telling you this for a reason,\u201d Fatima said. \u201cWe desperately need more support for people trapped in Sudan. In Darfur, there is genocide. But no one is talking about it. Women are being raped every day. Children have been killed and abducted. People are desperate. This is when you sell your kidney.\u201d All names have been changed \u2022 Follow the Long Read on X at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."

            "title": "EU plant exporters turning backs on UK over post-Brexit border checks, says trade group",
            "date": "2024-09-24T08:51:11Z",
            "content": "Exporters of plants and flowers from mainland Europe are turning their backs on supplying Britain as \u201cpainful\u201d new Brexit border checks are putting some trading relationships at \u201cbreaking point\u201d, garden centres and nurseries have warned. The Horticultural Trades Association (HTA), which represents garden retailers and growers, said long-held links between British nurseries and EU suppliers were now being put under strain because of the delays and costs associated with the new border processes. The comments were included in a letter to Lady Hayman, the borders, biosecurity and plant health minister, sent by the HTA on Friday, in which it said that some specialist transporters were now withdrawing from the UK market completely. On 30 April the government introduced new checks of plant and animal products entering the UK from the EU. The moves were brought in at selected border posts at ports to enhance Britain\u2019s biosecurity and prevent harmful plant and animal diseases entering the country. Commenting on the introduction of these checks, the letter said: \u201cAll parties involved in moving plants, trees, flowers, bulbs and seeds between the EU and the UK are now doing so under maximum pressure, facing unmanageable increases in costs, experiencing painful border processes yet with minimal information with which to do it. \u201cWe recognise the need for a strong biosecure system yet one that still facilitates and encourages legitimate trade.\u201d The letter was prompted by an incident at the government\u2019s Sevington border control post in Ashford last week, in which several lorries transporting plants from Italy were held for more than eight days over fears they were transporting pests into Britain. The Guardian understands that traces of the Pochazia shantungensis pest had been found in eight consignments, with these being given destruction notices. The government said that all consignments that had been held up and tested were found to have traces of the pest and these robust checks had stopped them from entering the country. However, affected suppliers have been highly critical of the lack of communication as to why the goods were being held, with the HTA saying the lack of clear information was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. Vincenzo Marini, the chief executive of the haulage company Marini, which sends 15 lorries a week to Britain, told the Guardian that one of his drivers was forced to stay in Kent, near Sevington, for six days after his company received no information on why their load had been held and when it would be released. Speaking last week, he said: \u201cThe lorry has now been blocked for eight days and today I had to switch drivers \u2013 the first one was sleeping in the lorry all this time. \u201cHow could I leave him there without any information on how long this would take? We are kept in the dark about everything.\u201d Marini, who has been sending good since the 1980s, added: \u201cThe UK is putting me into huge difficulties. I know other companies that have lost drivers, too, and so they have abandoned the UK due to this mess.\u201d Another affected Italian supplier, which preferred not be named, said it had now paused deliveries to the UK over concerns that similar holdups would take place, leaving a number of UK customers waiting for deliveries. The company, which relies on the UK for 60% of its business, said there had been no communication about what had happened and many of the support lines were engaged when they tried to contact support agencies. A spokesperson for the company said: \u201cSince the checks, transport costs have gone up a lot because lorries are now having to often wait five or six hours for these checks and you have to put the prices up. \u201cThe drivers don\u2019t want to go because they are getting sick and tired of waiting.\u201d This is the latest in a line of holdups at the border, with lorries being held for more than a day earlier in the year after IT outages led to long delays of perishable goods coming into the country. Transport en Logistiek Nederland, which represents 5,000 Dutch transport companies, told the Guardian earlier this year that some of its members could start rejecting jobs because of the new delays at the border, with the average driver being held for more than four hours. In its letter, the HTA called for border agencies to improve communication with their service users more clearly, and called for an urgent roundtable with ministers to discuss its concerns. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to reducing barriers to trade and cutting red tape by striking a fair balance between business and biosecurity. \u201cPhysical checks play an important role in helping stop harmful plant and animal diseases reaching our shores, as can be seen from detecting non-native plant pests found in these consignments\u201d."

            "title": "Harrods must reveal all NDAs signed by Mohamed Al Fayed\u2019s victims, say lawyers",
            "date": "2024-09-29T08:00:29Z",
            "content": "Lawyers acting for women attacked by Mohamed Al Fayed say Harrods must reveal how many people were silenced by non-disclosure agreements after its new owners pledged not to enforce any signed during his ownership. Fayed covered up his sexual abuse by intimidating victims into signing NDAs in exchange for money, as well as taking libel action against media outlets that tried to expose him. Yet the full extent of his abuses remains unclear and although more than 200 people have come forward so far, some women who were attacked may feel unable to take action, lawyers say. Harrods said in a statement: \u201cThere are no NDAs attached to settlements made under the current ownership and Harrods would not seek to enforce any NDAs that relate to alleged historical sexual abuse by Fayed that were entered into during the period of his, Fayed\u2019s, ownership.\u201d However, it was unable to say how many NDAs were signed under Fayed. Dino Nocivelli, a partner in the abuse team at Leigh Day, one of the law firms representing victims, said Harrods had a duty to go further. \u201cHave they reached out to women who have signed NDAs to let them know?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that some of the women have seen the publicity around this, but think that they can\u2019t say anything because of something they\u2019ve signed. Have Harrods put it on their website? Have they told any of the lawyers involved? \u201cIt\u2019s important that we know the true scale of this \u2013 how many women he abused, the time period, how old they were, where that abuse took place and when the allegations were made.\u201d The reason for understanding the scale, Nocivelli said, was that other people had helped Fayed cover up his crimes. \u201cThe fact that NDAs were used in certain cases, literally silencing a victim all over again, is despicable and resulted in other women having to carry the burden of their abuse for many unnecessary and painful years,\u201d he said. Fayed, who died last year aged 94, owned Harrods, the Ritz hotel in Paris and Fulham Football Club, as well as a charitable foundation, a publishing company and several properties. Harrods was sold to a firm controlled by the Qatari royal family in 2010. The BBC documentary Al Fayed: Predator at Harrods heard from more than 20 women who worked for Fayed. Five said he raped them while they were worked at the store. Fayed would pick out young female employees to to work more closely with him on the fifth floor of the Knightsbridge department store. He would then assault them in his offices, his apartment or on overseas trips. There have been allegations of attacks in London, Paris, St Tropez and Abu Dhabi. Since the documentary was shown, more women said they were attacked. Barristers from a legal team called Harrods Survivors, solicitors Leigh Day and US firm Motley Rice are now representing at least 60 people. Harrods Survivors said last week they had \u201ccredible evidence of abuse at other Al Fayed properties and businesses, including Fulham Football Club\u201d. Fulham said it was in the process of finding out whether anyone at the club had been affected. In May the previous government passed the Victims and Prisoners Act 2024, which would mean anyone signing an NDA who believed they were the victim of a crime would still be able to contact police, lawyers or other professionals. But the NDA clause has not yet come into force. Campaigners including Pregnant Then Screwed and Can\u2019t Buy My Silence have called for NDAs to be banned in employment disputes. Others have suggested a central authority should be created where NDAs should be registered before they can be enforced. The Metropolitan police said last week it was investigating new allegations against Fayed. Officers are \u201ccarrying out full reviews of all existing allegations reported to us about Al Fayed to ensure there are no new lines of enquiry based on new information which has emerged\u201d, it said. Although Fayed cannot now be pursued, \u201cwe must ensure we fully explore whether any other individuals could be pursued for any criminal offences\u201d, it added. Nineteen women made allegations between 2005 and 2023 to police about offences that took place between 1979 and 2013, including three allegations of rape, 15 sexual assaults and one related to trafficking. Yet Fayed was never prosecuted. The Met said officers had approached the Crown Prosecution Service five times, and passed a file of evidence twice, in 2009 and 2015. Various publications and broadcasters tried to investigate Fayed while he was alive. Vanity Fair reported in 1995 that Fayed had sexually harassed female staff and women were subjected to invasive medical examinations. Fayed sued, and the case was settled after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Fayed. ITV\u2019s The Big Story reported in 1997 that four women said they had been groped by Fayed and promised rewards for sex, and evidence that Fayed had bugged employee phones in Harrods. Fayed\u2019s son, Omar, said in a statement to Sky News that he was \u201chorrified\u201d by the allegations against his father. \u201cThe extent and explicit nature of the allegations are shocking and has thrown into question the loving memory I had of him,\u201d he said. \u201cHow this matter could have been concealed for so long and in so many ways raises further disturbing questions.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-02T06:00:25Z",
            "content": "The North Sea industry has warned the government not to toughen its windfall tax on oil and gas profits in the autumn budget, claiming it risks losing \u00a312bn in tax receipts and jeopardising 35,000 jobs. The industry\u2019s trade association, Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), has presented Treasury officials with data analysis that appears to show that proposed changes to the tax regime would devastate the sector\u2019s predicted investment over the second half of this decade. The group said it had made the analysis public to \u201chelp inform decision-making\u201d before the chancellor\u2019s budget in October. Labour came to power with an election pledge to toughen the windfall tax regime put in place by the previous government, known as the energy profits levy, by raising the headline tax rate by 3 percentage points to 78%. It has also promised to close the \u201cloophole\u201d left by the previous government that enabled oil and gas firms to reduce their taxes through investment allowances. The OEUK analysis assumes that all allowances will be scrapped, although this has not been explicitly proposed by the government. The report shows that trying to squeeze higher taxes from oil and gas profits would conversely lead to a \u00a312bn drop in tax receipts to the Treasury by wiping out new investments, and could prompt an overall loss in economic value of about \u00a313bn. OEUK said this investment slowdown could put 35,000 jobs at risk and may slash the forecasts for new oil and gas production volumes in the UK by two-thirds. David Whitehouse, OEUK\u2019s chief executive, said the analysis showed that the government\u2019s proposals to go further would \u201ctrigger an accelerated decline of domestic production, and a corresponding reduction in taxes paid, jobs supported and wider economic value generated\u201d. He said: \u201cThis is a government that has made economic growth its main priority, and yet our analysis shows that its policy will ultimately reduce this sector\u2019s contribution to the UK economy.\u201d Labour plans to use the higher taxes taken from the North Sea to help fund plans to turn the UK into a green energy \u201csuperpower\u201d in line with its goal of making the UK\u2019s electricity system net zero by 2030. The ambitious target is expected to cut Great Britain\u2019s emissions and reduce overall energy costs. A separate report from UK Steel, which represents the steel-making sector, said that its members in Great Britain pay up to 50% more for their energy than competitors in France and Germany owing to the UK\u2019s reliance on gas, which adds up to \u00a337m to electricity costs. The price disparity is predominantly driven by higher UK electricity market costs, due to the high price of running gas power plants, and partly by greater network charges, according to UK Steel. It has called on the government to help cover the cost of using power networks and consider moving policy levies from electricity bills on to gas bills to make it more economic for steelmakers to run electric furnaces. A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to maintaining a constructive dialogue with the oil and gas sector to finalise changes to strengthen the windfall tax, ensuring a phased and responsible transition for the North Sea.\u201d The spokesperson added: \u201cOur plans for a new national wealth fund and Great British Energy will unlock investment and create thousands of new jobs in the industries of the future.\u201d"

Rachel Leingang\u2019s story from the Trump rally is here: Former president Donald Trump delivered a speech in Indiana, Pennsylvania, telling supporters: \u2018If we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing.\u2019 JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, refused to take a stance on the scandal involving North Carolina\u2019s lieutenant governor during a Charlotte visit. A key Nebraska lawmaker rejected a Trump-backed effort to change state\u2019s electoral vote rules. A government shutdown seems to have been averted, with Republican speaker Mike Johnson heading off the politically damaging disruption by agreeing to a spending deal that does not include measures against non-citizen voting, which Trump had demanded. Kamala Harris won the endorsements of hundreds of former national security and military officials, who said Trump \u201chas proven he is not up to the job\u201d. The White House laid out how Joe Biden will spend his final months in office, dubbing it the \u201csprint to the finish\u201d. On Twitter, Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign also reacted to Trump\u2019s remarks on abortion and the overturning of Roe v Wade. \u201cTrump: Nobody should want a federal law protecting abortion rights,\u201d reads a tweet. Donald Trump has ended his 96-minute speech in Indiana, Pennsylvania. Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign reacted on Twitter to Trump\u2019s pledge to close the Department of Education. Trump later started using athletes in the Olympics to make anti-trans remarks and false claims. There were no transgender athletes who were competing outside of the gender they were assigned at birth at this year\u2019s Olympic games. \u201cWe are going to keep men out of women\u2019s sports,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so demeaning to women.\u201d \u201cYou will no longer be thinking about abortion,\u201d Trump said to the women in the room. \u201cIt is now where it always had to be: with the states, and the vote of the people.\u201d \u201cEveryone wanted abortion out of the federal government and into the states,\u201d he said. \u201cSix brilliant and very brave justices of the United States supreme court were able to do that for you, and they did it.\u201d Donald Trump turned his attention to women, claiming \u201cwomen are poorer than they were four years ago.\u201d He claimed women are less healthy, less safe, and more depressed than during his administration. \u201cI am your protector,\u201d he said. \u201cAs president, I have to be your protector.\u201d Donald Trump attacked Kamala Harris for her history as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, as well as the environmental policies she plans to put in place. \u201cShe wants to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles, which will destroy the Pennsylvania way of life,\u201d he said. \u201cAs Attorney General, she destroyed San Francisco and she destroyed all of California,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow she\u2019s coming to destroy the United States of America, and we\u2019re not going to let it happen.\u201d Donald Trump brought Republican David McCormick to the stage. McCormick is running against the Democratic Senator Bob Casey in an uphill battle for the senatorial seat. \u201cIt\u2019s a battle between common sense and these radical liberal policies,\u201d McCormick said. Donald Trump continued making anti-immigrant remarks. \u201cIf Kamala Harris wins this election, she will flood Pennsylvania cities and towns with illegal migrants from all over the world, and Pennsylvania will never be the same, you will never be the same,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m president, all migrant flights to Pennsylvania will stop immediately,\u201d Trump said. He then claimed that Kamala Harris never worked at McDonald\u2019s, a detail in her resum\u00e9 she uses to win over a powerful bloc of working-class voters. \u201cShe never worked there, and these fake news reporters will never report it,\u201d he said. After attacking Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, the crowd in Pennsylvania chanted \u201csend them back!\u201d Donald Trump later attacked Venezuelan migrants, generalizing the community and calling them \u201clawless gangs,\u201d while blaming them for problems in the housing market and with crime. Donald Trump returned to his claim that the city of Aurora, Colorado, has been overrun by Venezuelan immigrants. Trump has been using Aurora and Springfield, Ohio, as examples of the Biden administration\u2019s mistakes on immigration policies. \u201cHarris has inundated small towns all across America with hundreds of thousands of migrants,\u201d he said. He bragged about not using a teleprompter before asking: \u201cDo you think Springfield will ever be the same?\u201d Trump and JD Vance, his running mate, have falsely claimed that Haitian migrants were eating pets in Springfield \u2013 a statement that has been debunked. The former president also touched on the famed Pennsylvania steel industry. \u201cWe have to be strong and powerful again, and we must put tariffs on foreign predators,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make US steel great again.\u201d During Trump\u2019s administration, he imposed several rounds of tariffs on steel, aluminum, washing machines, solar panels, and goods from China. He has said that, if elected, he will would impose 10% worldwide tariff and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods. Trump touched a nerve with fracking in Pennsylvania, saying Kamala Harris is planning to ban it. \u201cIf anybody here believes that she will let your energy industry continue fracking, you should immediately go to a psychiatrist,\u201d he said. \u201cI will get Pennsylvania energy workers pumping, fracking, drilling and producing like never before.\u201d Donald Trump claimed that, during his presidency, foreign countries wouldn\u2019t fight each other without his permission. \u201cThey would call me up to ask whether or not they could go to war with some other country,\u201d he said. Trump took a stab at Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, calling him \u201cthe greatest salesman in history\u201d and said \u201che wants them to win this election so badly\u201d. Donald Trump says he promises to deliver tax cuts, attacking Kamala Harris for her plans to raise the corporate income tax rate. \u201cKamala Harris is the tax queen, and she\u2019s coming for your money,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s coming for your pensions, and she\u2019s coming for your savings, unless you defeat her in November.\u201d Trump then focused his speech on inflation, pointing to higher prices for energy and groceries. \u201cVote Trump, and your incomes will soar,\u201d he said. \u201cYour net worth will skyrocket, your energy costs and grocery prices will come tumbling down, and we will bring back the American dream, bigger, better and stronger than ever before.\u201d Former President Donald Trump once again falsely claimed that crime is going up, by 45 percent, despite recently released FBI statistics stating otherwise. Here\u2019s more context: During his speech in Pennsylvania, Donald Trump called Kamala Harris a \u201ccommunist\u201d and criticized her border policies. Trump said he thinks he won the 2016 elections because of his harsh border policies. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a great country any more,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI hate to say it, but America soon will be greater than ever before.\u201d \u201cOur entire nation is counting on the people of this great commonwealth,\u201d Donald Trump said about Pennsylvania. \u201cWe got to take our country back from these horrible people because, if we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing,\u201d he said. Donald Trump said that the 7 October attacks on Israel and the Russian attack on Ukraine wouldn\u2019t have happened if the Biden administration hadn\u2019t been elected. \u201cThink of how different this world would have been,\u201d he said. Trump then attacked Harris for dodging questions during her interviews. \u201cWe\u2019re here today because early voting begins in Pennsylvania over the next two weeks, and we need each and every one of you to go out,\u201d Donald Trump said at the start of his speech in Pennsylvania. \u201cGo out and make a plan to vote early, vote absentee or vote in person on election day, but you gotta get out and vote,\u201d he said. Donald Trump started his speech 50 minutes late instead of the scheduled 7pm slot in Indiana, Pennsylvania. He walked out to Lee Greenwood\u2019s God Bless the USA. Kamala Harris\u2019s and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaigns have ramped up efforts in Pennsylvania. In 2008, the state voted for the Democratic candidate, and again in 2012. But in 2016, Pennsylvania voted in favor of the Republican candidate. The state then voted Democratic in 2020. Earlier today, Trump participated at a roundtable in Pennsylvania to garner support from American farmers. Trump said he would impose a national sales tax with or without Congress. Former president Donald Trump is running 20 minutes late for his speech. He was slated to start at 7pm ET/4pm PT in Indiana, Pennsylvania. In a few minutes, Donald Trump will speak at an event at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, about 55 miles east of Pittsburgh. We\u2019ll be covering Trump\u2019s remarks. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer condemned Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib after accusing Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel of potential bias in bringing charges against pro-Palestinian protesters at the University of Michigan. Nessel later said Tlaib\u2019s comments were antisemitic. \u201cThe suggestion that Attorney General Nessel would make charging decisions based on her religion as opposed to the rule of law is antisemitic,\u201d Whitmer wrote in a statement to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, host of State of the Union. \u201cAttorney General Nessel has always conducted her work with integrity and followed the rule of law. We must all use our platform and voices to call out hateful rhetoric and racist tropes.\u201d New York Republican representative Anthony D\u2019Esposito gave part-time jobs to his lover and his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s daughter after winning his seat in Congress in 2022, the New York Times reports. D\u2019Esposito\u2019s hiring decisions are possible violations to congressional ethics rules, especially those against nepotism and engaging in relationships with employees under one\u2019s supervision. Both were employed in his district office, with the fianc\u00e9e\u2019s daughter earning $3,800 a month and the woman involved in the affair earning $2,000 a month. Earlier today, Donald Trump was asked about his plan to install a blanket tariff on all imports, with additional higher tariffs on goods brought in from China, as a way to extract money from rival nations. \u201cI don\u2019t need Congress, but they\u2019ll approve it,\u201d the former president said. \u201cI\u2019ll have the right to impose them myself if they don\u2019t.\u201d A spokesperson for Harris\u2019s campaign responded to these remarks: \u201cThis is the core tenet of Trump\u2019s Project 2025 playbook: seize power for himself, squeeze the middle class to the tune of nearly $4,000 a year, and make high costs even worse \u2013 all as he and his billionaire friends get another tax giveaway,\u201d she said. JD Vance kept getting asked by reporters about Mark Robinson. The crowd booed each time. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said, that is Mark Robinson\u2019s case to make to the people of North Carolina,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make it for him and the people of North Carolina, they get to be the judges of whether they believe him or not.\u201d Robinson, the Republican candidate for governor in North Carolina, has faced increasing pressure to drop out from the gubernatorial race after a damning CNN story reported that he made lewd and sexually explicit comments on the pornography site Nude Africa between 2008 and 2012. \u201cI really cannot believe that the American media is so much more focused on this than on the struggles of their fellow citizens,\u201d Vance said. Shortly after, Vance ended his speech. During his rally in Charlotte, JD Vance called gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson\u2019s reported comments uncovered by CNN (among others, referring to himself as a \u201cBlack Nazi\u201d), \u201cgross\u201d. But he added that Robinson had claimed he had never made the comments, which appeared on a porn forum in 2010. \u201cI think it\u2019s up to Mark Robinson to make his case to the state of North Carolina that those weren\u2019t his statements.\u201d JD Vance was asked whether he would change anything about the way he spreads the debunked false claims of pets being abducted and eaten in Springfield, Ohio. \u201cMy responsibility is to listen to the people that I serve and not a biased media, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll keep on doing in Springfield, Ohio,\u201d he answered. \u201cTo the people of this great state of North Carolina, I will always listen to you even when the media attacks me. I will listen to you about what\u2019s going on in your communities.\u201d \u201cI wish the American media was half as interested in the stress on the local schools, the stress on the hospitals and unaffordable housing as they are, and debunking a story that comes from the residents of Springfield,\u201d Vance said. During a Charlotte, North Carolina rally, JD Vance tapped into a well of grievance, blaming \u201cillegal aliens\u201d for the opioid epidemic and the scourge of fentanyl in the US. Vance has drawn condemnation for his unfounded claim that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio were stealing cats and dogs from community members and eating them. He has since doubled down on his claims, suggesting during an interview on CNN that he had license to \u201ccreate stories\u201d to garner interest in a topic like immigration. During his rally in North Carolina, Vance said that Harris was a \u201cbad person for causing this border crisis\u201d and that he and others \u201care not bad people for complaining about it.\u201d At the end of his speech, JD Vance supported Trump\u2019s plan around environmental policy. Trump plans to scrap the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act and its cleantech subsidies. \u201cYou want to talk about why our farmers are struggling? Because everything from the diesel fuel that they use to the fertilizer they use has gotten more expensive because of Kamala Harris\u2019s energy policies,\u201d Vance said. He is now taking questions from reporters. JD Vance recounted the story of his mother, who had struggled with opioid addiction, to attack Kamala Harris\u2019s policies at the southern border. Harris said she hopes to revive the border compromise law that would close loopholes in the asylum process. She also supports an earned pathway to citizenship. \u201cWe want Donald Trump because he\u2019s going to make it possible for us to enforce the border,\u201d Vance said. These remarks come after Vance's false, racist rumors of pets being abducted and eaten in a town in his home state of Ohio. During his speech in Charlotte, North Carolina, JD Vance said American families can no longer afford necessities, citing the higher price of a carton of eggs compared to the price during former president Trump\u2019s administration. \u201cWe believe that if you work hard and play by the rules, you ought to be able to afford a nice life for your American family,\u201d Vance said. He also said prices for gasoline and homes are higher. \u201cWe just need to get back to common sense economic policies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe American Dream doesn\u2019t exist without homeownership,\u201d Vance said. JD Vance attacked Kamala Harris, saying she dodges media interviews and questions related to the economy. \u201cHow can we trust Kamala Harris to represent us in front of the most dangerous regimes in the world if she won\u2019t even sit for an interview with the American media?\u201d Vance said. \u201cIt\u2019s funny to try to have her answer what her actual plans are for the American people,\u201d he said. JD Vance has taken the stage. The Republican vice presidential pick said North Carolina is one of the race\u2019s most important states. \u201cIt is going to be the state that turns this country red,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to send Donald Trump back to the White House, and we\u2019re going to do it thanks to the great patriots of this state.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump has a record to be proud of, and Kamala Harris has a record to be ashamed of, so we\u2019re not going to promote her,\u201d Vance added. Bishop took a stab at Kamala Harris, saying she \u201ccan\u2019t explain how she\u2019ll lower the cost of living or secure the border.\u201d He cited high crime rates in North Carolina. \u201cThey have no ideas or answers that work for the people,\u201d Bishop said before extending his support for Donald Trump and JD Vance. Congressman Dan Bishop, candidate for attorney general in North Carolina, took the stage before JD Vance in Charlotte. \u201cI\u2019m your nominee to become the first Republican attorney general for North Carolina since Zeb Walser in 1896,\u201d he said. In a few minutes, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, JD Vance, is expected to deliver a speech in Charlotte, North Carolina. We\u2019ll be covering his remarks. The sentencing of the disgraced former senator Robert Menendez has been delayed until 29 January. A judge on Monday delayed the sentencing of the New Jersey Democrat in his federal corruption case, which was originally set for late October. Menendez, 70, a three-term senator, was found guilty by a jury in a Manhattan courtroom of 16 counts of corruption, including bribery, extortion and acting as a foreign agent. A years-long investigation found Menendez had accepted bribes in the form of cash and gold bars in exchange for helping the governments of Qatar and Egypt. In Pennsylvania, Donald Trump spoke at an event hosted by the Protecting America Initiative, which is led by Richard Grenell, Trump\u2019s former acting director of national intelligence, and former New York congressman Lee Zeldin. Trump discussed his plans to counter the US reliance on China, backing his idea to use massive tariffs on goods imported from China to protect US industries and raise revenues. \u201cNobody\u2019s done for farmers what I\u2019ve done,\u201d he said. JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential pick, has picked Representative Tom Emmer to help him in his upcoming debate preparation against Governor Tim Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential pick, according to the New York Times. Over the past month, Vance has been working closely with his team, reviewing strategies for the face-off with Walz. Donald Trump\u2019s running mate will be debating Kamala Harris\u2019s running mate on 1 October in New York City at 9pm, marking their first televised debate. The preparation sessions have taken place at Vance\u2019s home in Cincinnati and via online meetings with his inner circle, including Trump campaign strategist Jason Miller, the Times reported. Congress appears on track to enact a spending bill that will keep the government open through 20 December, after Republican House speaker Mike Johnson dropped his demand for passage of a law requiring voters prove their citizenship before registering. Donald Trump has demanded passage of that bill, and in remarks on the Senate floor earlier today, majority leader Chuck Schumer condemned his tactics ahead of the election: The matter is now very straightforward: we now have less than a week to pass a funding bill through the House, through the Senate, and on to the president\u2019s desk. Both sides will have to act celeritously and with continued bipartisan good faith to meet the funding deadline. Any delay or last minute poison pill can still push us into a shutdown. I hope \u2013 and I trust \u2013 that this will not happen. Of course, as we proceed, it\u2019s important to remember that negotiations didn\u2019t have to wait until the last minute. This agreement could have very easily been reached weeks ago, but Speaker Johnson and House Republicans chose to listen to Donald Trump\u2019s partisan demands instead of working with us from the start to reach a bicameral, bipartisan agreement. Remember: Donald Trump has spent the entire month urging House Republicans to shut the government down if his poison pills weren\u2019t passed. That is outlandishly cynical: Donald Trump knows perfectly well that a shutdown would mean chaos, pain, needless heartache for the American people. But as usual, he just doesn\u2019t seem to care. Here\u2019s the latest on the spending negotiations: Keeping Nebraska\u2019s unique system of allocating electoral votes by congressional district in place improves Kamala Harris\u2019s chances of winning the election with only the three Great Lakes battleground states \u2013 Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Those three states combined with an electoral vote from Nebraska \u2013 which seems gettable, as the district encompassing the largest city Omaha leans Democratic \u2013 would send the vice-president to the White House. But Politico reports that the Teamsters union declining to endorse any candidate last week, after backing Democrats for years, could be a warning sign for Harris, particularly when it comes to the white voters who will decide the victor in the Great Lakes states. Here\u2019s more on that: The Teamsters withholding an endorsement from Harris this week \u2014 after internal polling showed most respondents backing Trump \u2014 is sparking fresh concerns that the GOP nominee could have higher-than-expected support among union members, especially men. Labor leaders in other sectors attest that, like in 2016 and 2020, the former president has maintained a grip on key parts of their rank-and-file despite his anti-union record. Privately, Democrats say Harris still has work to do to win over older, white, working-class voters who make up a large portion of the electorate in the Rust Belt and have been hit by high prices. \u201cCandidly, Trump has a solid, solid base of working-class people that have bought into his message,\u201d said Jimmy Williams, president of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, which has endorsed Harris. \u201cIt\u2019s movable and it\u2019s been moving. But it\u2019s not like some tide that\u2019s turned.\u201d Some Teamsters leaders have questioned the methodology of the polling showing Trump winning majority support among the union\u2019s members. But one pro-Harris union official, who was granted anonymity to speak freely, spoke in dire terms about it. The person said it is a \u201cred flag\u201d that is reminiscent of the 2016 election, when Hillary Clinton underperformed among union households despite winning the majority of top labor endorsements. \u201cHard not to have HRC flashbacks right now, to be honest, that stuff might be wrong beneath the surface,\u201d the official said. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not.\u201d Democratic strategists said Harris\u2019 performance in November could come down to the historic gender gap, especially among blue-collar voters, that has so far defined this election. An attempt by Donald Trump and his allies to convince Nebraska state lawmakers to change their system for allocating electoral votes appears to have faltered, after a key legislator said he opposed the campaign. The Nebraska Examiner reports that Mike McDonnell, an Omaha-area lawmaker who only recently switched his registration to GOP from Democratic, said he will not support changing the state\u2019s rules for allocating electoral votes to a winner-take-all system. Under the current system, electoral votes in Nebraska are allocated by congressional district, and Joe Biden won the district around Omaha four years ago. The change would benefit Trump, as it would almost certainly allow him to pick up all five electoral votes in the solidly red state. \u201cI have taken time to listen carefully to Nebraskans and national leaders on both sides of the issue. After deep consideration, it is clear to me that right now, 43 days from Election Day, is not the moment to make this change,\u201d McDonnell said. While Republicans control Nebraska\u2019s unicameral legislature, dissent within the party has stopped governor Jim Pillen from calling a special session to change the electoral vote rules. Here\u2019s more on the recent legislative push: Donald Trump launched a partisan attack on the justice department and FBI in a just-released statement, accusing the agencies of showing leniency towards the suspect arrested last week for apparently attempting to assassinate him. \u201cThe Kamala Harris/Joe Biden Department of Justice and FBI are mishandling and downplaying the second assassination attempt on my life since July. The charges brought against the maniac assassin are a slap on the wrist,\u201d the former president wrote. He went on to accuse the agencies of conspiring against him, mentioning his two impeachments as well as his involvement in the January 6 attack on the Capitol, among other scandals that occurred during his presidency, and after. \u201cThe DOJ and FBI have a Conflict of Interest since they have been obsessed with \u2018Getting Trump\u2019 for so long,\u201d he wrote. Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida who was Trump\u2019s one-time rival but has since endorsed him, has announced that the state will open its own investigation of the incident, which occured at Trump\u2019s golf course in West Palm Beach. Trump said that investigation should be taken precedent: If the DOJ and FBI cannot do their job honestly and without bias, and hold the aspiring assassin responsible to the full extent of the Law, Governor Ron DeSantis and the State of Florida have already agreed to take the lead on the investigation and prosecution. Florida charges would be much more serious than the ones the FBI has announced. The TRUTH would be followed, wherever it leads. OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS CORRUPT AND DISCREDITED, especially as it pertains to the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. LET FLORIDA HANDLE THE CASE! Police Leaders for Community Safety, a nonpartisan advocacy organization made up of law enforcement leaders from across the US, has endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for president. In a statement posted on Monday, Sue Riseling the chair of the organization, said that the endorsement of Harris \u201creflects Harris\u2019 track record and unwavering commitment to public safety and the rule of law\u201d. Riseling added that as law enforcement leaders, they \u201cknow first-hand what it will take to make our communities safer \u2013 and that includes having Kamala Harris as our next president\u201d. On Monday, Ryan Routh, 58 \u2013 who was arrested in Florida this month and accused of trying to assassinate Donald Trump at his golf course \u2013 was ordered to remain in jail without bond to await trial on two gun-related charges, according to a new report from Reuters. This comes as US prosecutors are seeking to charge Routh with attempting to assassinate a major political candidate, Reuters added. Earlier today, it was revealed in a court filing that Routh left behind a note where he acknowledged that he intended to kill the former president. The Republican Governors Association reportedly said in a statement that its pro-Mark Robinson advertisements are set to expire on Tuesday, and that no further placements have been made, according to the New York Times. This comes just days after CNN reported that Robinson, the Republican nominee for governor of North Carolina, had made disturbing comments on a porn message forum, including describing himself as a black Nazi. Earlier today, it was also reported that several of Robinson\u2019s top staffers on his campaign have quit in the days following the media report. Joe Biden is scheduled to appear on ABC\u2019s The View talk show on Wednesday, the network announced, adding that it will be Biden\u2019s first interview since the Democratic National Convention and the July presidential debate. The network added: The exclusive appearance marks the first live appearance by a sitting president on the show and the second time a sitting president has visited, following former Barack Obama\u2019s history-making visit which aired July 29, 2010. The United States is sending additional troops to the Middle East during the sharp surge in violence between Israel and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon that has raised the risk of a greater regional war, the Pentagon said moments ago. Pentagon press secretary Maj Gen Pat Ryder would provide no details on how many additional forces or what they would be tasked to do. The US currently has about 40,000 troops in the region, the Associated Press writes. The new deployments come after significant strikes by Israeli forces against targets inside Lebanon that have killed hundreds and as Israel is preparing to conduct further operations and the state department is warning Americans to leave Lebanon as the risk of a regional war increases. Due to the unpredictable nature of ongoing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and recent explosions throughout Lebanon, including Beirut, the US embassy urges US citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,\u201d the state department had cautioned on Saturday. You can follow the latest updates on the Middle East in our dedicated live blog: The man suspected of attempting an assassination of Donald Trump wrote a note where he acknowledged that he indeed intended to kill the former president, federal prosecutors revealed in a court filing. The document included several new details of the incident at a Florida golf course where Trump was playing last week, including that the FBI geolocated two cellphones belonging to Ryan Wesley Routh to the area around the former president\u2019s properties in the weeks leading to his arrest. Meanwhile, a new poll shows Kamala Harris trailing the former president in three of the four Sun Belt swing states, while another survey has her seeing a historic spike in her favorability ratings. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: A government shutdown seems to have been averted, with Republican speaker Mike Johnson heading off the politically damaging disruption by agreeing to a spending deal that does not include measures against non-citizen voting, which Trump had demanded. Harris won the endorsements of hundreds of former national security and military officials, who said Trump \u201chas proven he is not up to the job\u201d. The White House laid out how Joe Biden will spend his final months in office, dubbing it the \u201csprint to the finish\u201d. Joe Biden is set to depart the White House next January, after he ended his bid for a second term and endorsed Kamala Harris. This morning, his administration\u2019s communications director Ben LaBolt announced Biden\u2019s \u201csprint to the finish\u201d, a plan to spend his final months in office doing what he can to achieve his administration\u2019s priorities. \u201cWhen the president decided to step back from the campaign and endorse the vice-president, he called his senior team together that day and said we need a plan for the next 180 days to finish as strong as we started,\u201d LaBolt wrote, continuing: Every day the president meets with his team, he is pushing to lay it all out on the field for the remainder of the term. His directives are: Aggressively execute on the rest of his agenda Look for new opportunities to put a stake in the ground for the future Hit the road to highlight the Biden-Harris record Show up as a president for all Americans and communicate directly with them on how the Biden-Harris Agenda will pay dividends now and 10, 20, 30 years into the future LaBolt offered a preview of what Biden would be doing in the days and weeks to come: The week of 9/23, the president will roll out new policy to combat gun violence. This is a president who has taken dozens of executive actions to counter the scourge of gun violence, established the first ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention \u2013 overseen by the vice-president, and signed the most significant gun violence prevention legislation in nearly 30 years. The week of 9/23, the president will give a speech on the historic work he has done to tackle the climate crisis and the Biden-Harris administration will make new policy announcements to keep building on this progress The president will keep traveling the country \u2013 highlighting the Biden-Harris record The president will travel internationally as he continues to strengthen our alliances and partnerships on the world stage, which has been a top priority for him as president having restored American leadership on the world stage North Carolina has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 2008, but recent polls have shown Kamala Harris within striking distance of taking its 16 electoral votes. The Guardian\u2019s George Chidi has a look at why: Landon Simonini found himself standing in the middle of a Charlotte highway lane at 2.30 in the afternoon, stuck in an artificial traffic jam while drivers waited for Kamala Harris\u2019s plane to land and the motorcade to clear for the rally later that day. He was out of his car, because why not? He wasn\u2019t going anywhere soon. His red Make America great again cap stood out among others cursing the traffic gods. Simonini, born and bred in Charlotte, builds houses. His livelihood depends to some degree on Charlotte\u2019s tremendous growth. But not all growth is great, he said. \u201cThis is a traditionally southern state,\u201d Simonini said. \u201cOver 100 people move to Charlotte a day. That is changing the election map. I am born and raised in Charlotte, for 33 years. I have lived here my entire life. I went to school at UNC Charlotte. This is my city. It is a conservative city and I want to keep it that way.\u201d But in America\u2019s nail-biting 2024 presidential election, North Carolina is now in play. It rejoins a select list of crucial swing states whose voters will decide if Harris becomes America\u2019s first woman of color to win the White House or if Donald Trump returns to the Oval Office from which he wreaked political chaos for four years. A group of more than 700 former military and national security officials have released an open letter endorsing Kamala Harris over Donald Trump, who they write \u201chas proven he is not up to the job\u201d. \u201cHarris has proven she is an effective leader able to advance American national security interests. Her relentless diplomacy with allies around the globe preserved a united front in support of Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russian aggression. She grasps the reality of American military deterrence, promising to preserve the American military\u2019s status as the most \u2018lethal\u2019 force in the world,\u201d reads the letter released by National Security Leaders for America. As for Trump, the group writes: Mr Trump threatens our democratic system; he has said so himself. He has called for the \u201ctermination\u201d of parts of the Constitution. He said he wants to be a \u201cdictator,\u201d and his clarification that he would only be a dictator for a day is not reassuring. He has undermined faith in our elections by repeating lies, without evidence, of \u201cmillions\u201d of fraudulent votes. He has shown no remorse for trying to overturn the 2020 election on January 6th, promises to pardon the convicted perpetrators, and has made clear he will not respect the results of the 2024 election should he lose again. That alone proves Mr Trump is unfit to be Commander-in-Chief. Here\u2019s more: Days after the House of Representatives failed to pass a government spending bill coupled with legislation against non-citizen voting demanded by Donald Trump, the Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, is making a new attempt to head off a government shutdown without bowing to the former president\u2019s demands. Here\u2019s more on the legislative maneuvering, from the Guardian\u2019s Robert Tait: US congressional leaders have agreed to a short-term funding deal in a move that averts a damaging pre-election government shutdown and also amounts to a snub for Donald Trump. The prospect of a shutdown at the expiration of the current government funding on 30 September had been looming after Republicans insisted on tying future funding to legislation that would require voters to show proof of US citizenship \u2013 known as the Save Act and backed by Trump but opposed by Democrats. After weeks of backroom maneuvering, the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, announced a compromise that provides funding for another three months while decoupling it from the Save Act. Any other path would have been \u201cpolitical malpractice\u201d, he added. The new package continues present spending levels while also giving $231m in emergency funds to the beleaguered Secret Service to enable it to provide added protection for Trump \u2013 the Republican presidential nominee, who has been the subject of two failed apparent assassination attempts \u2013 as well as his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, before the presidential election on 5 November. It represents a climbdown for Johnson, who had previously adhered to Trump\u2019s demand that government funding be conditioned on passing the Save Act. The bill \u2013 has become an article of faith for the former president and his supporters due to their belief, unsupported by evidence, that electoral fraud is rife. Kamala Harris has seen a surge in favorability among voters and is increasingly viewed as the candidate most likely to bring change, a NBC News poll released on Sunday found. Among registered voters nationwide, the vice-president is ahead by five percentage points, with 49% support against Donald Trump\u2019s 44%. She is also seen as the candidate more likely to bring \u201cchange\u201d, a potentially significant finding given that other surveys have found many Americans believe the country is on the wrong track. Among respondents, 47% say Harris represents change, while 38% say the same of Trump. NBC News also found Harris\u2019s favorability jumped 16 points since July, a surge comparable only to what George W Bush saw after the 9/11 attacks. Kamala Harris continued to goad Donald Trump over the weekend to debate her again. But, as the Guardian\u2019s Joanna Walters and Edward Helmore report, the former president\u2019s campaign insisted there would be no more debates: Kamala Harris has accepted an invitation from CNN to participate in another debate with Donald Trump, on 23 October, her campaign said on Saturday. \u201cDonald Trump should have no problem agreeing to this debate. It is the same format and setup as the CNN debate he attended and said he won in June, when he praised CNN\u2019s moderators, rules and ratings,\u201d the Harris campaign chair, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, said in a statement. \u201cI will gladly accept a second presidential debate on October 23,\u201d Harris later posted on X. \u201cI hope Donald Trump will join me.\u201d Trump debated Joe Biden in June when the US president was still running for re-election. Biden performed so badly that he ended up dropping out of the race in July, and Harris, his vice-president, ascended to the nomination. Asked about Harris\u2019s acceptance of the CNN invitation, a Trump spokesperson pointed to the former president\u2019s prior statements that there would be no more debates. Donald Trump will hold a rally in Mint Hill, North Carolina, near Charlotte, on Wednesday afternoon, his campaign announced. It will be the former president\u2019s second rally in the swing state in recent days, after he spoke to supporters in Wilmington over the weekend. North Carolina Republicans are grappling with the fallout from last week\u2019s report that Mark Robinson, their candidate for governor, had a history of making lewd and offensive statements on a pornography site\u2019s message board. The statements were bad enough that most of Robinson\u2019s campaign staff has resigned. Here\u2019s more on that: Here\u2019s more on what we learned from prosecutors today about Ryan Wesley Routh\u2019s motivations to make a suspected second attempt on Donald Trump\u2019s life, from the Guardian\u2019s Edward Helmore: The man accused in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump at a golf course in Florida left behind a note saying that he intended to kill the former president and maintained in his car a handwritten list of dates and venues where the Republican White House nominee was to appear, the justice department said on Monday. The new allegations were included in a detention memo filed ahead of a hearing on Monday at which the justice department was expected to argue that 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh should remain locked up while the case is pending. The details are meant to buttress prosecutors\u2019 assertions that Routh had set out to kill Trump before the plot was thwarted by a Secret Service agent who spotted a rifle poking out of shrubbery on the West Palm Beach golf course where the former president was playing on 15 September. The note, addressed \u201cDear World\u201d, was placed in a box that was dropped at the home of an unidentified person who contacted law enforcement officials after last Sunday\u2019s arrest. It appears to have been based on the premise that the assassination attempt would ultimately be unsuccessful. In addition to the geolocation data tying two of his cellphones to the areas around Donald Trump\u2019s properties, FBI agents also found in Ryan Wesley Routh\u2019s possession a list of dates where the ex-president would be in August, September and October. Prosecutors added that Routh had \u201ca notebook with dozens of pages filled with names and phone numbers pertaining to Ukraine, discussions about how to join combat on behalf of Ukraine, and notes criticizing the governments of China and Russia\u201d. Two cellphones found in the car Ryan Wesley Routh was driving when he was arrested were geolocated to areas near Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort and his golf course in Florida in the weeks leading up to his apparent assassination attempt, prosecutors wrote. The phones, part of six that FBI agents found in Routh\u2019s vehicle, made repeated visits to the vicinity of the two Trump properties between 18 August and 15 September, the court document said. Agents also examined the SKS rifle found in the bushes outside the golf course where Trump was playing, and discovered a fingerprint they matched to Routh. The rifle was found in the bushes outside the fence line near the sixth hole of the golf course, and prosecutors wrote that Trump was playing on the fifth hole when a Secret Service agent saw the rifle\u2019s gun barrel protruding from the bushes, and opened fire. In addition to the rifle, prosecutors wrote that FBI agents found a backpack and shopping bag attached to the fence that contained plates \u201ccapable of stopping small arms fire\u201d. FBI agents also reviewed a book they believe Routh authored in February 2023 called Ukraine\u2019s Unwinnable War: The Fatal Flaw of Democracy, World Abandonment and the Global Citizen-Taiwan, Afghanistan, North Korea, WWIII and the End of Humanity, according to the court document. In the book, Routh stated that he: Must take part of the blame for the [person] that we elected for our next president that ended up being brainless, but I am man enough to say that I misjudged and made a terrible mistake and Iran I apologize. You are free to assassinate Trump as well as me for that error in judgment and the dismantling of the deal. No one here in the US seems to have the balls to put natural selection to work or even unnatural selection. In a court document submitted today, prosecutors said Ryan Wesley Routh dropped off a box at a witness\u2019s house months prior to making his attempt on Donald Trump\u2019s life. After learning of Routh\u2019s arrest, the unnamed witness opened the box and contacted law enforcement. Prosecutors say the box contained \u201cammunition, a metal pipe, miscellaneous building materials, tools, four phones, and various letters.\u201d One letter was addressed to \u201cThe World\u201d and read, in part: This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you. I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster. It is up to you now to finish the job; and I will offer $150,000 to whomever can complete the job. He [the former President] ended relations with Iran like a child and now the Middle East has unraveled. The man suspected of making a second attempt on Donald Trump\u2019s life last week acknowledged that was his intention in a note discovered by police, prosecutors wrote on Monday. \u201cThis was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you,\u201d Ryan Wesley Routh wrote in the note, which was included in a package he gave to an unnamed witness before his arrest. Good morning, US politics blog readers. Broadly speaking, there are two groups of swing states expected to decide the presidential election: the Great Lakes states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and the Sun belt states of Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina. The closely watched pollsters at the New York Times and Siena College today released new data from three of the latter group, showing Donald Trump preferred by voters over Kamala Harris, albeit to varying degrees. The poll finds the vice-president\u2019s standing is weakest against Trump in Arizona, where she now has a five-point polling deficit after the same pollsters showed her with a five-point lead last month. The race in Georgia is tighter but the tightest state is North Carolina, which has not supported a Democratic candidate for president since 2008. The survey is the latest sign of the the presidential race remaining in toss-up territory two months after Harris took over as the Democratic candidate from Joe Biden. The Times and Siena College poll is just one data point among many others, but if its findings bear out, it would leave the vice-president reliant on the Great Lakes states as well as Nevada, the fourth Sun belt state that was not surveyed, or a single Nebraska congressional district to win the White House. Here\u2019s what else is happening today: The government appears to have dodged the threat of another shutdown, after congressional leaders reached a spending agreement that expires on 20 December, defying Trump\u2019s demands that they also approve legislation to require voters to prove their citizenship when registering. Biden honors women\u2019s soccer champions Gotham F.C. at 10.30am ET, then meets with president Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates at 12.20pm before heading to New York City for the UN general assembly. Israel has launched a volley of airstrikes at Lebanon today, again raising fears of a regional conflict. You can read out live blog all about it here. JD Vance is delivering remarks in Charlotte, North Carolina at 5pm. Trump will hold a rally in Indiana, Pennsylvania at 7pm."

            "title": "Mandelson-backed Bank of London reveals \u00a342m in fresh funding days after winding-up petition",
            "date": "2024-09-09T17:10:16Z",
            "content": "The Bank of London, the fledgling clearing bank backed by the Labour grandee Lord Mandelson, has announced it has raised another \u00a342m from investors days after being hit by a winding-up petition by tax authorities. The financial company said the oversubscribed funding round closed in August, and was led by Luxembourg\u2019s Mangrove Capital Partners. Mangrove is an existing investor known for backing companies such as Skype. Its chief executive, Mark Tluszcz, sits on the BoL board. It did not reference the tax debacle in the funding announcement, saying only that the investment would \u201cposition the bank for its next phase of growth in its core UK market\u201d. However, the news is likely to help quell concerns about the bank\u2019s future, after HM Revenue and Customs lodged a winding-up petition against the bank in UK courts last Thursday. The company is not disclosing how much was owed, and it is unclear how long the taxes has been outstanding. A source close to the BoL claimed the HMRC petition was because of an internal communication error about the tax it owed. They said the management team were unaware of the matter until last week, but that once it was discovered, it was fixed within hours. A BoL spokesperson said the \u00a342m fundraising pre-dated, and was unrelated to, the winding-up petition. They also said it was not linked to top-level turnover; the chief risk and compliance officer, Stephen Bell, took over as chief executive from its founder, the former Barclays executive Anthony Watson, last week. Watson will transition to a new role as a senior adviser and board member. The bank has notable ties with the Labour party, with Watson having previously served on the party\u2019s business and enterprise advisory council before the July general election. Mandelson, a former Labour cabinet minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, also serves on the board as BoL\u2019s deputy chair. Commenting on the funding round, Tluszcz said: \u201cThe Bank of London\u2019s ability to close an oversubscribed \u00a342m funding round speaks to the confidence investors have in its leadership and unique model. The bank is well positioned to redefine the future of financial services and we are more than happy to support it.\u201d It is the first notable bout of turmoil for the BoL, which became the second clearing bank to enter into the UK market in 250 years when launched in 2021. Unlike traditional banks, such institutions do not offer loans, but instead provide clearing and settlement services for business customers, operating the plumbing that allows transactions and payments to take place. The BoL says it targets \u201cbusinesses with complex, international, or regulatory needs\u201d, according to its website, which advertises that it can open accounts for unregulated financial companies in as little as 20 minutes. Alongside another challenger, ClearBank, the BoL is hoping to disrupt the stronghold of the big four banks \u2013 NatWest, Lloyds, Barclays and HSBC \u2013 which are the most popular institutions for clearing services in the UK. The BoL, which also has offices in Belfast, New York and North Carolina, was valued at $1.1bn (841m) in 2023, and has since grown a client base of 4,500 clients with \u00a3500m in deposits. It made headlines last year when it became one of the bidders hoping to take over Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s UK arm during the mini banking crisis that gripped the industry in March 2023. However, SVB UK was eventually snapped up by HSBC for \u00a31. Bell said: \u201cOur banking model is built on security and simplicity. By holding deposits at the Bank of England, businesses have full confidence in their funds being available at all times. Our success in completing this \u00a342m funding round underscores investor belief and confidence in our vision, and I am excited to take over leadership of the Bank of London as it continues to grow.\u201d"

            "title": "North Sea oil firm Neo slows investment amid windfall tax concerns",
            "date": "2024-09-02T13:46:11Z",
            "content": "An oil and gas company has slowed down work on a large North Sea oilfield, citing uncertainty over the Labour government\u2019s approach to fossil fuels. The Norwegian-owned Neo Energy said it had decided \u201cto materially slow down investment activities across all development assets in its portfolio\u201d, citing the prospect of higher taxes and tougher environmental rules. Neo\u2019s projects include the Buchan Horst oilfield, about 70 miles north-east of the Aberdeenshire coast in Scotland. The field had been due to start production by the end of 2027, with an estimated 162m barrels of oil equivalent. The decision highlights a battle ahead for the Labour government, which came to office with a pledge to raise taxes on North Sea producers to fund a rapid transition to green electricity generation. The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, last week decided the government would not defend against legal challenges brought by environmental groups about two other North Sea projects, throwing them into further doubt. Greenpeace and Uplift had brought judicial reviews against the decisions, arguing that ministers had not properly considered whether they were compatible with the UK\u2019s legally binding targets to reach net zero carbon emissions. The court in June agreed that government decisions must take into account \u201cscope 3\u201d emissions \u2013 those produced from actually burning oil and gas \u2013 as well emissions from production. The energy department said it would consult on new environmental guidance, with details not due until spring. Neo said that had delayed its project, while tax rises \u201cclearly have a negative impact on the economics and overall viability of a project such as the Buchan Horst\u201d. It added: \u201cIn recent weeks the government has announced a number of measures which have materially increased the level of uncertainty in relation to the UK\u2019s oil and gas sector and investment decisions in this context are extremely challenging.\u201d Neo owns 50% of the Buchan Horst project, while Serica Energy and Jersey Oil &amp; Gas own 30% and 20% respectively in a joint venture. The partners had predicted the costs of developing the oilfield would be between \u00a3850m and \u00a3950m. The share price of Jersey Oil &amp; Gas slumped by 20% on Monday. Andrew Benitz, the Jersey chief executive, said: \u201cHomegrown energy should always trump imports, creating domestic economic growth, jobs and valuable UK tax receipts.\u201d North Sea oil is generally sold into the global market. Neo Energy \u2013 from \u201cnew European offshore\u201d \u2013 was founded in 2019 to explore the UK continental shelf. It is backed by Hitec Vision, a Norwegian oil investor. The company had grown by buying out projects from France\u2019s TotalEnergies and America\u2019s ExxonMobil, among others. The purchases made it one of the top five North Sea oil producers. The announcement came on the same day that the industry\u2019s lobby group, Offshore Energies UK, published analysis that claimed increases to the energy profits levy \u2013 the windfall tax on North Sea producers \u2013 could result in the loss of \u00a312bn in tax receipts and 35,000 jobs. However, the report did not take into account the costs to the UK and the world of continued emissions of carbon into the atmosphere. The International Energy Agency, a respected forecaster, in 2021 said the world could not afford to allow any new oil, gas and coal exploration and production if it were to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 \u2013 a target that would avoid the most devastating climate impacts. The energy profits levy was first introduced by the Conservative government in 2022 when oil and gas producers were enjoying huge earnings as Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine caused a global rise in prices. Labour has said it will increase the headline rate on the energy profits levy by three percentage points to 78%: that is comprised of the 40% standard tax rate, plus a 38% windfall tax. Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservative party, on Monday said: \u201cLabour\u2019s reckless policy on North Sea oil and gas would undermine energy security and confidence in the sector.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero did not comment on Neo\u2019s criticisms, but pointed to its statement last week that the UK will be a \u201cclean energy superpower\u201d, and that the government is committed to protecting jobs during the energy transition. \u2022 This story was amended on 3 September 2024 to add a response from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero"

            "title": "Labour\u2019s tax red lines have left Reeves with \u2018one hand tied\u2019 for budget, says IFS",
            "date": "2024-09-20T23:01:23Z",
            "content": "Rachel Reeves has \u201cone hand tied behind her back\u201d as she considers how to balance the books next month in her first budget, a leading economic thinktank has said, after she ruled out increases to the four main taxes that account for 75% of all revenues. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Labour had promised not to raise income tax, national insurance, VAT or corporation tax before the budget, heightening speculation that Reeves will seek to increase revenues from rises in capital gains tax, inheritance tax and stamp duty on property sales. The IFS said there was a danger the chancellor would seek extra revenues from \u201ceconomically damaging\u201d tax rises that only bring short-term relief to the government\u2019s spending deficit. The IFS said Labour entered office faced with \u201cunenviable arithmetic\u201d given that the previous government had pushed tax revenues to the highest level since the 1940s, while also imposing \u201cbig cuts to public investment and some public services\u201d. \u201cMerely avoiding spending cuts would \u2013 if debt is to fall \u2013 likely require raising tens of billions of additional revenue by 2028-29,\u201d the report said. Official data on Friday put further pressure on the government to raise taxes after it showed that Britain\u2019s national debt had risen to the highest levels since the 1960s. Soon after taking office, Reeves said the Conservatives had left a \u00a322bn hole in the public finances, mainly from underfunded pay increases for public sector workers and a deficit of more than \u00a36bn in the Home Office budget. This shortfall was only partly filled by the \u00a31.4bn saving from restrictions to the pensioners\u2019 winter fuel allowance. Saying that \u201cReeves has not made life easy for herself\u201d, the IFS said government spending could still be supported by large injections of funds from taxes outside the big four, but it would take courage to carry through the necessary changes. It said England could copy the example set by Scotland in 2017 and increase the council tax that applies to homes ranked from band E to H, raising \u00a31.5bn in extra revenue. \u201cGoing further and increasing rates by 50% on the highest-value properties \u2013 bands F to H \u2013 would bring in closer to \u00a33.5bn,\u201d the IFS said in a report, Options for Increasing Taxes. Changes to inheritance tax, which is on course to raise \u00a37.5bn in this financial year, could increase the Treasury\u2019s firepower, it said. \u201cA good start would be ending, or at least capping, the unjustified exemptions for pension wealth, business assets and agricultural land \u2013 a change that would raise around \u00a32bn a year assuming no behavioural response,\u201d it added. Counselling against an increase in stamp duty on property sales, the IFS said this would repeat the mistake made by George Osborne, who increased insurance premium tax to a level that deters people from buying insurance. \u201c[Stamp duty on property] \u2026 should be reduced or \u2013 even better \u2013 abolished, and certainly not increased,\u201d the report said. Isaac Delestre, an IFS research economist, said: \u201cWith large swathes of the tax system seemingly off-limits due to Labour\u2019s manifesto commitments, the chancellor is going into this year\u2019s budget with one hand tied behind her back. There will be a temptation to increase revenues in ways that would be economically damaging. \u201cBut Rachel Reeves also has the power to fix some of the more glaring deficiencies of our tax system: taxes on pensions, capital gains and inheritances \u2013 to name just three \u2013 are all crying out for reform. \u201cIf she takes the opportunity to improve taxes, as well as increase them, she could be rewarded not only with more revenue but also with a tax system that is fairer and less of an impediment to growth.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-03T07:00:17Z",
            "content": "There is a famous satirical tweet that goes something like: \u201cLast night I asked my landlord to increase my rent. That\u2019s how much I believe in my grind/hustle.\u201d Well, last week, Chelsea asked one of their biggest rivals to take one of their best players for no fee, with no obligation to buy and with Chelsea still paying most of his wages. Clearly, Clearlake Capital\u2019s belief in their grind/hustle has some way to run. For all this, there are plenty of people out there who will tell you that Chelsea\u2019s decision to play Raheem Sterling in all six of their pre-season fixtures, then decide to sell him, then fail to sell him, then pay him \u00a3200,000 a week to play for Arsenal, is a stroke of underrated genius, 4D strategising on a level the financially illiterate among us will never truly grasp. In which case, I have a luxury hotel for you to sell yourself. But then part of the shtick of Chelsea\u2019s new ownership is the idea that their approach represents a bold break with tradition, even a whole new way of thinking about the sport, and as such I was keen to absorb some of their methods into my own business practice. With this in mind I started investing in garden gnomes: a relatively low\u2011cost, low-maintenance investment that everybody seems to enjoy. At first I visited local garden centres buying up their stock, and when that avenue was exhausted I started going directly to people\u2019s gardens, offering them premium fees for their existing gnomes, or perhaps borrowing their gnomes with a contractual obligation to purchase at a later date. Of course, any rube can go out and buy a gnome. My vision was to seek out and nurture the gnomes that would furnish the gardens of the future. I would visit ceramics factories and buy gnomes straight out of the cast, before they had been painted or finished. Sometimes, I would buy the design blueprints on spec, or even unfinished gnome prototypes. Occasionally, well-connected intermediaries would secure me highly prized international gnomes \u2013 for a sizeable transaction fee, of course \u2013 and while the quality was often erratic I comforted myself with the knowledge that if I did not snap these gnomes up my neighbours certainly would. Slowly the gnomes began to gather in my store cupboard, eventually spilling out into the guest bedroom, the hallway, the bathroom (I do not have a garden). Friends would ask if I was OK. Before long I was in possession of Lambeth\u2019s most extensive collection of unvarnished garden gnomes, at which point phase two of the master plan kicked in. Given their low overheads and years of untapped potential, I figured that in an artificially constricted market I would now be able to sell most of my gnomes for a handsome profit, while naturally reserving the very finest for my own personal use; namely, sitting alongside me on the sofa while I watched the Uefa Conference League. Alas, this part of the endeavour proved somewhat tougher. Somehow word had got around the neighbourhood that I was desperate to offload hundreds of garden gnomes. Prospective buyers drove a hard bargain. Often I would end up giving away world\u2011class gnomes at heavily subsidised rates. The promised windfalls failed to materialise. Bills began to pile up on the kitchen table. All the while I was still buying gnomes at a ferocious rate, to the point where I was forced to buy a garden centre in France to showcase my excess stock. Time to get creative. After all, I was still rich in sellable assets, even if cashflow was becoming an increasing problem. The fact that many of these assets were essential home-based items with high levels of emotional attachment simply rendered them, in accountancy terms, prime target. The bed and bedside tables, for example, could be banked as pure profit. So too my guitar, my collection of rare books and art, my furniture and bike. I decided to sell my car to myself and amortise the expense over nine years. I used my two children as security against a fresh debt\u2011restructuring facility. People began to point at me in the street. There was ridicule, of course. There always is when you try something new. At times the criticism veered into the absurd: people would rail at the callous treatment of my gnomes, arguing that most of them would never even see a real garden. As if these were human beings with families and emotions and ambitions, rather than purely inanimate items of ceramic matter with theoretical resale value. Yet by the same token, as I sold off the last original \u201clegacy\u201d furnishings from my flat in order to make space for more gnomes, a strange thing happened. The fevered debate over my gnome investment strategy on the airwaves and social media gradually began to subsume any rational assessment of its success or failure. Sides were taken. Positions became entrenched. Camera crews pitched outside my flat on a daily basis to ask people what they thought. Journalists would ring me for quotes and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that most would publish pretty much anything I told them. I write these words to you now from what used to be my living room. A casual observer might survey this scene, with its bare walls and the pile of red-tinged final notices and the literal thousands of garden gnomes, and identify a certain pathos. But maybe this is just what revolution looks like. People call it chaos. I call it content. People call it plain old asset-stripping. I call it visionary disruption. People ask me what the endgame is. I tell them simply to enjoy the journey. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "title": "Reeves could change fiscal rules to allow more capital spending, say sources",
            "date": "2024-09-23T17:20:24Z",
            "content": "Rachel Reeves is considering changing how the government\u2019s fiscal rules are calculated to allow billions of pounds more in capital spending, according to government sources. The chancellor told the Labour conference on Monday she believed the Treasury undervalued public investment and wanted to change the way public spending is seen at the top of government. Sources have confirmed she could use next month\u2019s budget to change the way the government\u2019s five-year debt rule is assessed in a way that could allow more spending on housing, roads and hospitals. Reeves told delegates in Liverpool: \u201cIt is time the Treasury moved on from just counting the costs of investment in our economy to recognising the benefits too.\u201d She added: \u201cGrowth is the challenge and investment is the solution.\u201d At a later business event, she said: \u201cThere are difficult decisions coming in the budget, but what I can promise is we will always give value for money for taxpayers. And we will look at the value and benefits of investment and not just the costs.\u201d Her comments reflect a growing belief in the government that its fiscal rules need to be updated to encourage investment and spur growth. Critics have accused the Treasury of prioritising short-term debt reduction ahead of its long-term infrastructure and growth needs, pointing to decisions such as the cancellation of the HS2 rail line as an example. Tom Railton, director of the Invest in Britain campaign, said: \u201cIf Labour maintains the discredited Conservative \u2018debt stock\u2019 rule, Britain will struggle to escape the economic stagnation that this rule helped to create. \u201cWe need a budget for long-term growth, and that has to start with creating a set of pro-investment fiscal rules focused on long-term growth and sustainability.\u201d Labour promised in its manifesto to abide by the previous government\u2019s rule that public sector net debt should be falling as a proportion of economic output in the fifth year of a forecast period. But sources say how that debt is calculated is now being reconsidered. One idea Reeves is weighing up is to exclude losses for the Treasury on the Bank of England winding down its crisis-era quantitative easing bond-buying programme, which experts say could open up headroom in the public finances worth up to \u00a315bn. Another person familiar with the discussions said the chancellor was considering plans to move Labour\u2019s new institutions, the National Wealth Fund and GB Energy, off the government\u2019s books. Andy King, a former senior official at the Office for Budget Responsibility, has said that could give her another \u00a315bn more headroom for borrowing. A third option would be to exclude certain projects from the debt calculation if the Treasury calculates they will provide enough of a boost to the economy. Government officials added that they were also working on a plan to publish estimates for how much new capital projects could stimulate growth, as well as how much money they would generate directly for the Treasury. These plans are part of what Reeves said on Monday was a strategy to encourage building in Britain. Painting a more optimistic picture of the country\u2019s long-term economic future than she has in recent months, she said: \u201cWhat you will see in your town, in your city, is a sight that we have not seen often enough in our country: shovels in the ground, cranes in the sky, the sounds and the sights of the future arriving,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will make that a reality.\u201d She added: \u201cThis is our moment, our chance to show that politics can make a difference, that Britain\u2019s best days lie ahead.\u201d But she also issued a steadfast defence of some of her more unpopular decisions in her first few weeks in the Treasury, including cuts to winter fuel payments to pensioners and to infrastructure projects that she says were not properly funded. Reeves told the conference: \u201cI know that not everyone in this hall or in the country will agree with every decision that I make. I will not duck those decisions, not for political expediency, not for personal advantage.\u201d She also defended the government\u2019s decision to raise public sector pay even in the face of the difficult spending outlook. \u201cWe made that choice not just because public sector workers needed a pay rise, but because it was the right choice for parents, patients and for the British public, the right choice for recruitment and retention, and it was the right choice for our country,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the Conservative party want to fight about who can be trusted to make the right choices for our public services and those who use them, then I say: bring it on.\u201d At almost the exact moment she was delivering this message, however, the Royal College of Nursing announced its members had rejected a 5.5% pay increase from the government. Trade unions have been a thorn in the government\u2019s side throughout this conference, and are organising a vote calling for the cut to winter fuel payments to be reversed. Reeves said next month\u2019s budget would not herald a return to austerity. She told the BBC earlier in the day that Whitehall budgets would rise on average, but would not make the same promise for individual departments. Economists say an average rise in Whitehall budgets of 1% over inflation \u2013 which was assumed under the previous government\u2019s plans \u2013 would mean steep cuts to unprotected areas, such as courts and local government. A Labour official said: \u201cWe needed to be honest about the scale of the challenge. The public and businesses want government to be honest. This speech was about the prize at the end of it.\u201d The chancellor announced little in the way of new policy but did confirm plans, first revealed by the Guardian, to relaunch investigations into \u00a3674m worth of Covid contracts. The announcement led to a standing ovation from delegates. Reeves\u2019s speech was briefly disrupted by a heckler protesting about British arms sales to Israel, which the chancellor reacted to by saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve had the years of protest, we\u2019ve had years of division and decline, but left working people worse off.\u201d"

For film noir thrills The Third Man, one of the best thrillers ever made (no arguments, please), premiered 75 years ago this month and offers a fascinating history of postwar Vienna \u2013 one the Viennese aren\u2019t keen on, says Gerhard Strassgschwandtner, founder of the Dritte Mann Museum. \u201cIt brings up too many painful memories of the war and a Vienna crushed.\u201d An enduring reminder, the 3,000 artefacts displayed in more than a dozen rooms show Vienna carved up by the allies. Highlights include Trevor Howard\u2019s original script, the sewer grill that Harry Lime wraps his fingers around in a final bid for freedom and the zither on which Anton Karas played the film\u2019s famous theme tune. Gerhard\u2019s insightful reflections make it worth a detour and if you\u2019re inspired to visit one other landmark in the film, make it the ferris wheel at Prater amusement park. For the best interactive museum The imaginative refurbishment of the Wien Museum brings the city\u2019s history to life through interactive exhibits and more than 50,000 artefacts from the Middle Ages to the present day. Its restaurant-caf\u00e9, Trude, is a design-forward affair serving modern Austrian cuisine; its sleek caf\u00e9-bar, T\u00f6chter, has a rooftop terrace and there\u2019s a DJ on the terrace in the warmer months. For the perfect coffee At the heart of Vienna\u2019s coffee-house culture is Caf\u00e9 Sperl, an old-school institution close to Naschmarkt (the lively foodie market, Mon-Sat, 6am to 7.30pm), where you can play billiards or enjoy their coffee and whipped cream with a slice of Sachertorte.

Instead, admire the glass cabinets of doughnuts and towering cakes in the palm tree-filled salons \u2013 and treat yourself to a takeaway slice of F\u00e4chertorte. Hipsters will prefer the Viennese retro granny vibe at Karlslatz\u2019s Vollpension on Schleifm\u00fchlgasse 16, also close to the Naschmarkt. Here, older bakers entice a young crowd with Formica tables, retro chairs and Grandma\u2019s breakfast specials, fresh cakes (with vegan options) and evening cocktails. Cute.

            "date": "2024-09-19T16:53:41Z",
            "content": "Scores of people reportedly died in a jihadist attack in the Malian capital on Tuesday, again raising questions about the junta\u2019s capacity to tackle a 12-year insurgency. Islamic militants attacked a number of locations in Bamako, including an elite police training academy. The violence, which the al-Qaida affiliate Jama\u2019a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) claimed to have carried out, led to the closure of the city\u2019s airport for the day. The authorities said the insurrection had been quelled and acknowledged on state television that there had been fatalities but did not disclose the number. However, a security source told Agence France-Presse on Thursday that 77 people had been killed and 255 wounded. AFP also reported that an authenticated confidential official document put the number of dead at about 100, and named 81 of the victims. The newspaper Le Soir de Bamako reported that the funerals of about 50 military police students were taking place on Thursday. A security official who was inside the training camp at the time of the attack told the Associated Press anonymously that at least 15 suspects were arrested. A plane used by the World Food Programme (WFP) was also damaged at the airport. Djaounsede Madjiangar, a WFP spokesperson, said the aircraft was used to \u201ctransport aid workers and provide emergency humanitarian aid in remote areas of Mali\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not the only plane we use in Mali, but this reduces our humanitarian response capacity to give to civilians, given that we have several destination points,\u201d he added. The South African aviation company National Airways Corporation said the plane, which it leased to WFP, was attacked while on the ground in Bamako. All crew and staff were unharmed, Madjiangar said. In 2012, a Touareg uprising evolved into an insurgency that Mali has failed to stem. Jihadist activity has since spread to the rest of the Sahel, prompting concerns among leaders of coastal west Africa that downstream activity from the armed groups is almost inevitable. More than 1,600 civilians were killed in the first nine months of 2023, 17% more than during the whole of the previous year, according to figures from the non-profit organisation Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (Acled). The latest attack took place as the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), a confederation formed between Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, announced plans to issue a new passport outside the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) zone. When introduced, the move will cement AES\u2019s independence from the regional bloc it claims is being swayed by western interests. Divisions in Ecowas arose partly because of a military takeover in Mali after the perceived failure of the civilian leadership to stem the insurgency, despite the presence of French troops. Another factor that has caused tensions has been Mali\u2019s use of Russian mercenaries to help tackle the insurgency within its territory. Mercenaries with Russia\u2019s Wagner group have suffered a string of recent losses in the region. The most recent and perhaps heaviest took place in July when rebels ambushed a convoy of Malian armed forces and Moscow\u2019s Africa Corps at Tinzaouaten, near the border with Algeria. The Malian military said more than 20 rebels were killed during the clash, while JNIM claimed to have killed 50 Russians and 10 Malian soldiers, a figure that could not be independently verified. That incident led to severance of diplomatic ties with Ukraine after Kyiv claimed to have shared intelligence with the rebels."

            "date": "2024-09-14T07:00:24Z",
            "content": "The sun is setting on the Super League season as next month\u2019s Grand Final approaches and, while all 12 teams wind down for the winter, one club is facing a potentially serious situation. With IMG\u2019s controversial gradings system going live next month to replace conventional promotion and relegation from 2025, only the 12 highest-scoring clubs in a variety of on and off-field metrics will qualify for Super League status. The one thing IMG did not account for, though, in its planned shake-up of the game is the club ranked 24th in the provisional gradings. By winning promotion against the odds, the London Broncos, in effect knew they would be booted out of Super League at the end of this year irrespective of how they performed as a result of their poor grading. Even then, it was supposed to be straightforward. London, knowing their fate before a ball had been kicked, opted for a season in Super League with a part-time squad and were expected to be routinely humiliated, making IMG\u2019s decision seem more credible. However, with a fortnight of the regular season to go, London could still avoid finishing bottom. Before the weekend\u2019s fixtures they were level on points with 11th-placed Hull with two games remaining and have taken some of the league\u2019s biggest teams all the way. Which prompts the question: what next for a club who will be dismissed to the Championship by IMG and have no realistic chance of Super League for years to come? Is this the end for the sport in the capital? \u201cI don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d admits their coach, Mike Eccles. \u201cI\u2019ve not enjoyed this year. This club is going to look almightily different from this in every single way possible. We have made so much progress but we are going to lose it all.\u201d The Broncos\u2019 impressive squad has been cherrypicked of some key players. Eccles says London have just seven contracted players for 2025. What\u2019s more, their longstanding owner, David Hughes, who has invested tens of millions into the Broncos, is to spend \u201csubstantially less\u201d according to Eccles. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t see a route back to Super League for us as it stands,\u201d he says. London have frequently spoken out against the IMG gradings. Last month, Hughes called for them to be scrapped and Eccles says there is a case for the Broncos to be granted an exemption to remain in Super League given their progress. He points to crowds growing at their Wimbledon home and the club producing more homegrown players than many northern rivals. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to put my name to this \u2013 you have got to treat London differently,\u201d Eccles says. \u201cThere has to be an exemption. It\u2019s a different world down here. We cut our cloth accordingly, we produce players on par with the best academies in the game and we\u2019ve got a home where we can build. Things are different down here.\u201d Expansionists would argue there is a precedent in Catalans Dragons, who finished bottom of Super League in their inaugural season in 2006 but were exempt from relegation; 18 years later, they have won the Challenge Cup, reached two Grand Finals and often attract five-figure crowds in the south of France. But a stay of execution will not be forthcoming this time. Despite IMG conceding in December 2022 that London were a \u201csleeping giant\u201d of rugby league and the capital topped all the data metrics, the Broncos are not just going to be ushered back to the Championship, they are going to be there for years to come, with their grading way off the required score. \u201cWe face a long road to get back to Super League,\u201d Eccles says. \u201cThere\u2019s no eyes and ears on the Championship, no TV coverage and no investment. So how are you going to do it, especially in London, where you have to pay players more? I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible but it\u2019s going to be incredibly hard.\u201d Eccles is keen to stress the positives, too, however. Two years ago, London were nearly relegated from the Championship; now, their squad of predominantly local players is holding its own in the Super League. The Broncos have shown that there is a place for the capital in the sport\u2019s long-term plans but IMG does not see it that way. \u201cThis clearly works \u2013 we\u2019re showing it works on the field and off it,\u201d says Eccles. \u201cDo you really want to throw this away? It\u2019s a crying shame we aren\u2019t going to be able to build on this. We don\u2019t want money, we just want a chance to show that this club and this region has a place in rugby league. This is the point of no return. How badly does the sport want London?\u201d"

            "content": "If modern politics has left you feeling that up is down and left is right, then Kemi Badenoch seems to have some sympathy for you. In the middle of her densely argued 40-page political pamphlet, released on Monday, she attempts to explain much of modern politics using simple geometry and a topsy-turvy sense of direction. And somewhere within these two shapes is the central argument of the document \u2013 titled Conservatism in Crisis: Rise of the Bureaucratic Class \u2013 released by Badenoch\u2019s Conservative leadership campaign. The somewhat cryptic diagram on page 16 shows two triangles split in half. The first has a horizontal line through it, with the word \u201cright\u201d at the top and \u201cleft\u201d at the bottom. Another is split down the middle vertically, with \u201cright\u201d and \u201cleft\u201d side by side. But in the latter, the word \u201cright\u201d is on the left-hand side, and vice versa. The explanation for the triangles is actually relatively simple, even if the resulting policy prescriptions in the 40-page document are not so much. The triangles seek to note a key difference between 20th- and 21st-century politics. With the first, the vertical divide stands for the traditional idea of affluent voters, nearer the top of the economic pile, leaning to the right, with poorer ones underneath favouring the left. The second triangle shows a new paradigm, based not on economic tiers but values. But why, in the second triangle, the one split laterally, are \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d the wrong way round? A spokesperson for Badenoch was unable to provide an answer. As succinctly explained by Badenoch herself in an introduction, politics is \u201cno longer about class in the old sense\u201d but more about belief-based splits that often result in more educated, urban voters aligning with the left. The problem with this, Badenoch and the pamphlet argue at length, is that the left-leaning world has constructed around itself a regulation-based, entrepreneurship-crushing ecosystem that is stifling economic growth. Reminiscent in parts of the writings about the \u201cnew elite\u201d by the academic turned activist Matthew Goodwin, it also takes aim at what Badenoch calls \u201ca victimhood and complaint culture\u201d that becomes self-sustaining and self-rewarding. What can be done to reverse this? Here matters become slightly more woolly, but it appears to involve fewer HR managers and compliance staff, and an end to \u201cpointless university degrees\u201d that inculcate young people into this cosy left-leaning world without making them more economically productive. But, besides the left-right reversal, there is another mystery in the document, not least who wrote it. This is not stated, and Badenoch\u2019s team say only that it is \u201ca Renewal 2030 pamphlet\u201d, the name of her wider campaign. But the document does say it will soon be expanded into a book."

I don\u2019t even feel safe eating at a Chipotle nowadays let alone consuming products made by six-year-olds with grubby hands and boogers on their fingers. So why is everyone so shocked by the countless tales of lemonade stands \u2013 like the ones in Texas, Alabama, Virginia, Colorado and Wyoming, all run by children \u2013 that were shut down out of health violation concerns? Or maybe the snow-shoveling business in New Jersey run by two teenagers that was forced to cease because it wasn\u2019t deemed safe? Or the nine-year-old who was selling cookies baked at home that raised red flags with safety inspectors? People seemed generally outraged when they read these things. And lawmakers \u2013 like the ones in Texas and 13 other states \u2013 have passed legislation that, in some cases, allows children to do this stuff. I don\u2019t like it. Shut \u2019em all down. Why? I like to write about small business. I get inspired by entrepreneurs. But when it comes to child entrepreneurs? No thank you. This isn\u2019t the middle ages. Our society has made great strides in food safety. Why would we want to go back in time and risk our health just to help fund a kid\u2019s purchase of that Lululemon belt bag or Mega Cyborg Hydro Blaster? Also, let\u2019s all be honest: we know why the kid\u2019s really doing this. It\u2019s not to \u201clearn\u201d about \u201centrepreneurship\u201d. It\u2019s just an activity to keep them busy during those long summer days when school is out and when mom and dad want some peace and quiet. But how about a family trip to the park? Or a game together? Parents: your kids are going to grow up and move out of the house before you know it. Don\u2019t have them waste time selling warm liquids on your street. I\u2019m also not a fan of the prepubescent-industrial complex that has risen to meet the new generation of \u201cyouth entrepreneurs\u201d. I see organizations like Biz Kids, Kid Everest, E-Seedling and Beta Camp and I\u2019m sure they do a great job and have helped many young people. These organizations \u2013 and dozens of others \u2013 provide education and resources to teach kids how to manage money, receive mentorship from \u201cpeers\u201d and even participate in crowdfunding opportunities. Yes, crowdfunding opportunities. Do you not wonder how many of these groups are actually for-profit (most are) and charge fees for the services they provide (most do)? So who\u2019s really the entrepreneur here? All of this isn\u2019t the way to educate kids about business. Learning how to make something for $1 and sell it for $3 isn\u2019t that hard. It\u2019s basic math. There\u2019s plenty of time to understand the nuances of finance, marketing and sales. My most successful clients have learned these things on their own. But they also know a lot more. They have a deeper understanding of human nature and they use this knowledge to manage teams and engage with their customers. Business is about trust. And experience. And relationships. You don\u2019t learn these skills as a child. You learn them when you\u2019re older. Yes, some are innate and some develop over time. But I see too many high school (and even middle school) students losing their summers to activities that will look good on a college application. And now this type of behavior is trickling down to even younger kids who are encouraged by their parents to spend their days doing things that kids don\u2019t need to be doing. Please stop selling lemonade. Go and play. There\u2019s plenty of time to earn a living. Have a childhood first."

            "date": "2024-09-08T11:00:45Z",
            "content": "Kamala Harris has announced initiatives to help small businesses in the US. It\u2019s a smart \u2013 and welcome \u2013 move given that 46.4% of all private sector employees work for small businesses. I do worry, however, that she is targeting the wrong issues. Among the vice-president\u2019s proposals is to \u201ccut down\u201d on government bureaucracy, creating a \u201cstandard deduction\u201d for small businesses and \u201cmaking it easier\u201d for businesses to get occupational licenses to operate across state lines. She wants to \u201csuggest new steps\u201d for more investments in rural businesses with an \u201cexpansion fund\u201d that would make it easier for businesses in those areas to get access to capital. She also wants to mandate that \u201cone-third\u201d of federal contract dollars go to small businesses. All of these proposals sound good. Like so many other of her proposals, they lack details, so it\u2019s very difficult to comment on their impact and their cost. But Harris did get specific about one idea: taxes on startups. If elected, Harris wants to increase the small business \u201cstartup tax deduction\u201d from $5,000 to $50,000, which would not only allow more startup expenses to be written off but would defer this deduction to years when profits are being generated. \u201cMy plan will invest in small businesses and innovators throughout America,\u201d Harris said. Sounds cool. But unfortunately, what she\u2019s proposing is targeting the wrong small businesses. The Biden administration recently announced that there have been about 19m new startups since the president took office in 2021. According to the treasury department, entrepreneurship \u201ccontinues to surge\u201d with \u201cthe United States averaging 430,000 new business applications per month in 2024, 50% more than in 2019\u201d. Do we really need more incentives for startups? They seem to be doing fine. The small businesses that really need help are the more than 6m established, employer-owned companies. These are my clients. Their optimism is at historically low levels, small manufacturers are \u201cmired in a slump\u201c and the service businesses are struggling to grow. According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), 99.9% of businesses are small businesses (more than 33 million in total), and they employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. These are the businesses that Harris should be helping. How? Here are four ways. The first would be to extend the qualified business income tax deduction that was part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This is a huge deduction for \u201cpass-through\u201d companies that make up the vast majority of established small businesses. This provision allows most of these businesses to deduct 20% of their costs before their income \u201cpasses through\u201d to their individual returns. It\u2019s an enormously helpful tax benefit and it expires at the end of 2025. Extending or making permanent this deduction would have a huge impact on these voters. I\u2019m one of them, by the way. The second has to do regulations. Under the Biden administration, new regulations from various agencies have limited the use of independent contractors, increased overtime pay, added new harassment rules, expanded fines for safety, made it easier for unions to organize and introduced rules to ban non-compete agreements, among other measures. All these issues are important. But while larger companies can absorb these costs, small businesses \u2013 and the organizations that represent them \u2013 have been fighting these rules in court. Why? Because they\u2019re costly. Exempting the smallest of companies (maybe those with fewer than 10 workers?) from many of these rules would cut their costs, reduce their administrative burden and let them invest, hire and grow. Third, investing in rural businesses and mandating more government contracts is nice in theory. But ever heard of Apex Accelerators? The HUBzone Program? The 8(a) Business Development Program? I didn\u2019t think so. These are programs that already exist to help businesses get government contracts but they\u2019re underutilized. The money should go into advertising and public relations campaigns to increase the awareness of these resources. Finally, there\u2019s a \u201csilver tsunami\u201d of baby boomer business owners who are looking to move on to their next phase in life and are putting their succession plans together. It\u2019s estimated that an $80tn transfer of wealth will occur in the US over the next two decades. Unfortunately, many employees \u2013 particularly in rural areas \u2013 may be left without jobs if these businesses shut down without a buyer and many business owners may find themselves without the retirement savings they were hoping for. A great way to address this challenge is to encourage the creation of employee stock ownership plans, or Esops. There are already generous tax incentives to form these entities, where employees can purchase equity in their companies from their employers. But these rules could be expanded to smaller organizations and the incentives sweetened in order to motivate more business owners to sell their companies to their workers. The startup environment in the US is already strong and I\u2019m not worried about this country\u2019s entrepreneurism. What concerns me is the state of the existing small business owners that are core to our economy. The pizza shops, gasket distributors, building materials suppliers and accounting firms. What will our next president do for them?"

            "content": "The Baltimore houses are in rough shape. They might be missing roofs, or even floors. Some have been inhabited by squatters. Rats come in. Cats follow. As David Lidz, founder of the Waterbottle Co-op, which rehabilitates the foreclosed homes, points out, the contents are hard to view dispassionately. \u201cWhen a family leaves, most of the time they leave a ton of stuff there,\u201d he says. \u201cYou find old photo albums and caps and gowns and baby clothes.\u201d As Lidz sees it, these houses are a metaphor for so many of Waterbottle\u2019s worker-owners \u2013 himself included \u2013 who are in recovery from substance use disorders or have had run-ins with the criminal justice system. \u201cWhen we reach the bottom, we look like those houses inside,\u201d the 58-year-old explains. \u201cWe\u2019re just full of remorse and regret and guilt and pain. And we\u2019re trying to clean all that out, so we can become a vessel of utility and service and spirituality and love.\u201d Waterbottle, whose portfolio now includes 25 properties across the Baltimore area, is essentially born from some of Lidz\u2019s lowest moments in 2002, when he couldn\u2019t find a job. \u201cIn the 90s, I had a white-collar career in Washington DC as a government relations officer, which I drank away because I was also an alcoholic,\u201d he says. One day, he was out walking near the Baltimore sober house where he had been living. \u201cI saw some dudes working on a vacant house,\u201d he says. \u201cI got to talking to them and they explained they were in this business called \u2018property preservation\u2019. It\u2019s sometimes called \u2018loss mitigation\u2019 \u2013 where they get hired by large mortgage institutions to maintain and manage foreclosures.\u201d Standing on that Baltimore sidewalk, Lidz\u2019s most immediate takeaway was that he could get a job like that. \u201cI just needed a cordless drill, a digital camera, a shitty van and a shitty lawn mower and I could do the work. I could cut the grass and trash out properties,\u201d he says. He recalls grueling days of working all by himself. \u201cI would do things like remove stinky refrigerators that had been abandoned for years, and it would be, like, August and I would roll it out to my van by myself,\u201d he says. Lidz got more and more work, and soon needed to hire help to keep up with his commissions. In his own recovery journey, he says, \u201cI was hearing that the best way to stay sober is to help other people stay sober. So I hired folks who were recovering from alcoholism or addiction or were coming back from jail or prison.\u201d Waterbottle\u2019s hiring approach is one that Xiomara Rivas Brown, the organization\u2019s human resources director, calls \u201cradical inclusion\u201d. Rather than fixating on employees\u2019 past challenges, \u201cwe focus on skills and interest\u201d, she says. \u201cWhat can you do? What do you want to learn? What do you want to work on?\u201d As his crew grew, Lidz obtained his contractor\u2019s and real estate licenses, rehabbing and gut-renovating houses. The only hitch was, he was borrowing money with high interest rates to purchase the properties. \u201cWe were bleeding money,\u201d he says. That\u2019s when Lidz and his colleagues struck upon the idea of becoming a worker cooperative. \u201cI was aware of this new term \u2013 well, new to me \u2013 of impact investment, which is sometimes called \u2018catalytic\u2019 or \u2018program-related funding\u2019,\u201d Lidz says. \u201cWe understood it to have better terms and lower interest rates than market-rate products.\u201d In 2020, they got Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) funding, which focuses on distressed communities, from the grassroots organization Seed Commons, and became a social enterprise: a business that uses its strategy, profits and capital to address societal concerns. About 3% of all global businesses are social enterprises, according to recent research from the Schwab Foundation\u2019s Global Alliance for Social Entrepreneurship. These businesses generate $2tn yearly and are responsible for creating 200m jobs. With support from Seed Commons, workers\u2019 earnings increased. \u201cWe raised our wage rates from $11 to $17 an hour before we converted to co-op to $18 to $48,\u201d Rivas Brown says. Jazmin Hernandez, who has worked her way up from trashing out properties to being on the drywall and window-install crew, says: \u201cThe most rewarding part of the job is bettering my economic condition.\u201d She found the job through her life partner \u2013 and yes, the all-in-the-family aspect of the crew is definitely a thing, Lidz says, adding that his wife also works with Waterbottle. Not only are the co-op members making more per hour, they\u2019re also benefiting from their hard work in another way: when a property is renovated, it becomes part of the rental real estate portfolio that workers have a stake in. They have first dibs on assuming the lease on the freshly redone rentals. While the co-op owns 25 properties today, the goal is to rehabilitate 200 Baltimore properties by 2026. Granted, being one of many owner-members can require a shift in mindset for some workers who aren\u2019t used to a co-op model. \u201cWe push the employees to get involved,\u201d Rivas Brown says. \u201cWe try to get them into meetings and show them balance sheets and numbers and renovation costs. We don\u2019t want it to be like: Oh, management is doing this and workers are doing that.\u201d Or, as Lidz puts it: \u201cThis is your company, too. You\u2019re a worker-owner. You own the hell out of this house.\u201d"

            "content": "When Nuha Siddiqui and Kritika Tyagi pitched their packaging foam while studying at university, they used a creative way to grab the investors\u2019 attention \u2013 Siddiqui ate their product in front of the panel. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have decades of experience,\u201d says Siddiqui. \u201cBut what we did have was the proof of our technology and willingness to build a solution that was truly transformative. \u201cSo we thought we could prove that by eating the product to show how this could truly change the way we think about plastics and packaging, with something that\u2019s so natural and so non-toxic that you could actually eat it.\u201d Tyagi remembers the judges \u201caudibly gasping\u201d as Siddiqui began to consume their packaging made from regenerative agricultural waste, and there was a moment\u2019s silence before everybody started applauding. \u201cI felt the energy shift and it was so inspiring,\u201d she says. Inspiring is a good way to describe the two 28-year-olds. As the planet drowns in traditional plastic waste, the company they co-founded, Erthos, is working to reimagine the building blocks of plastics with sustainable biomaterials, offering scalable alternatives for a range of everyday products. Erthos product applications include items such as personal care containers, hangers, pill bottles and keg caps for the drink and brewing company AB InBev. Their journey began at the University of Toronto, where the friends first met in an entrepreneurship club. \u201cKritika and I come from very different backgrounds,\u201d says Siddiqui. \u201cBut what brought us together was our shared passion for solving the plastic crisis using science and business, and finding a way to do it in a really meaningful and impactful way.\u201d As they were getting started, they juggled their studies with long evening sessions testing packaging materials. Siddiqui remembers that some of their peers at the public research university thought they had too much on their plates. But this only spurred them on. \u201cWe eventually took the leap and decided that we weren\u2019t going to take corporate jobs and we would give this our full-time attention,\u201d says Tyagi. A brave decision and the right one \u2013 nearly half of startups dissolve within five years, but six years later Erthos is thriving. Last year, it raised C$6.5m (\u00a33.6m) of funding, increasing its total financing to US$11.2m (\u00a38.3m). Then, in May, it announced a new direction, Erthos Studio, which saw it transition from a manufacturing company to an AI-powered climate technology company, with a goal of accelerating the widespread adoption of sustainable materials worldwide. But that\u2019s not all the pair have achieved. The duo, who started as Ecopackers packing peanuts during their time at university, slowly evolved their product. Packaging foam no longer the focus of their company, Siddiqui and Tyagi\u2019s Erthos progressed to biomaterials manufacturing over time, as the partners knew the importance of not just replacing one application product, but the materials themselves. This transition comes at a time when many companies are beginning to publicly acknowledge that they may not meet their sustainability targets by 2025. \u201cWe\u2019re still seeing a massive amount of plastic pollution,\u201d says Siddiqui. \u201cAnd big brands are missing a lot of their targets when it comes to reducing plastic in our environment. So the pivot was our response to the urgency that exists today.\u201d While the news cycle frequently presents AI as a threat, Erthos Studio is well equipped to show how new technology could be a saviour, in the form of Zya, its proprietary machine learning AI platform. \u201cWhen we think about Zya, we think about how it can be leveraged to really push the boundaries of innovation and rethink the way that we do research in material science or any chemical based industry,\u201d says Tyagi. Zya has a database of hundreds of replacements for traditional plastic ingredients. The database also includes the company\u2019s custom propriety ingredients that the in-house lab invented. All ingredients have been vetted to improve the performance of the biomaterials that clients use to apply to their sustainable products. From day one, all their work has been grounded in a keen awareness that some people are being impacted by the climate and plastic crises more than others. \u201cWe know that there\u2019s a disproportionate impact of this in marginalised communities,\u201d says Siddiqui. \u201cSo right from when we thought about building Erthos, we thought about it in a way that was scalable and genuinely made an impact in the communities that truly needed it.\u201d They\u2019ve come far since their days at the University of Toronto, where Siddiqui studied environmental economics and commerce accounting, and Tyagi plant biology and English language and literature. They beam as they acknowledge the role their alma mater continues to play in their journey. \u201cThe University of Toronto does a great job of putting you in an environment where you can meet extraordinary people who have very similar passions, beliefs and visions,\u201d says Siddiqui. \u201cIt played a key part in our early days and it gave me the purpose that I have today.\u201d Recognised as one of the top five university business incubators in the world by UBI Global, the University of Toronto has \u201can incredible network\u201d, says Tyagi, and its programming has \u201creally provided us with so many different opportunities to speak\u201d in \u201ca multitude of different forums\u201d. She and Siddiqui were recently back at the campus and visited the basement where they first decided they were going to embark on the project. \u201cThat was where Nuha decided she would reject her full-time job and I wouldn\u2019t continue to pursue further education,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was really sweet walking through those halls again \u2013 the university will forever be woven into the fabric of Erthos and the story that we\u2019ve created.\u201d Meet the extraordinary community that\u2019s pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible"

            "date": "2024-09-11T04:00:02Z",
            "content": "Drivers working for Bolt, the ride-hailing app operator, are seeking to be classed as workers rather than self-employed contractors at an employment tribunal. More than 12,500 drivers, who are represented by the law firm Leigh Day, are bringing the action against Bolt, an Estonia-based ride-hailing app which has been operating in the UK since 2019. The drivers claim they should be treated as workers because of the significant control Bolt has over how they work, and say they should be given the same rights and protections as typical workers. The high-profile employment rights case, which begins in central London on Wednesday, comes as the new Labour government prepares to draw up its plans to strengthen workers\u2019 rights in legislation. In the UK there are two types of employment status: employees and workers, both entitled to holiday pay and minimum wage. However, employees enjoy much broader rights, such as being able to sue for unfair dismissal. Independent contractors do not have any of these rights. The litigation against Bolt comes three years after its rival Uber lost a landmark case at the UK\u2019s supreme court which found that Uber drivers were workers, rather than being self-employed, and so were entitled to rights such as the minimum wage. Companies operating in the gig economy have been under pressure since then to improve pay and conditions for drivers and couriers. Charlotte Pettman, an associate solicitor at Leigh Day, said eight drivers were due to testify at the hearings. \u201cThis is one of the biggest cases of its kind in recent years,\u201d she said. \u201cOver the next three weeks, the employment tribunal will hear about the Bolt drivers\u2019 working conditions and decide whether they are workers and entitled to compensation for unpaid holiday pay and shortfalls to the \u201cnational living wage\u201d.\u201d Bolt, which does not class the drivers as workers, announced as of 1 August its drivers would receive holiday pay and a guarantee of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d. As of April 2023, there were an estimated 100,000 Bolt drivers in the UK working in cities including Manchester and London. Leigh Day, which is representing the drivers on a \u201cno win, no fee\u201d agreement, will argue that the way Bolt is calculating these payments is not compliant with current legislation, and has said this means they are not entitled to compensation for previous unpaid holiday or shortfalls to the national living wage \u2013 which the drivers are claiming as part of the lawsuit. Bolt said that its business model \u201cenables drivers to be their own boss, and the majority of private-hire drivers consistently state that they wish to remain self-employed independent contractors, as they value the flexibility, personal control over pricing, and earning potential offered by this model\u201d. The company said that, in its recent survey, six in 10 drivers identified the ability to choose their own hours as the most important aspect of their work. The Labour government has yet to lay out the details of its employment rights legislation, but the new measures are expected to include a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts, ending \u201cfire and rehire\u201d practices, and introducing basic employment rights from day one in a job. Other expected reforms include repealing anti-trade union legislation introduced by the last government, and creating a single enforcement body to ensure employment rights are being upheld. Hopes of a plan to bring in a single status for all employees, which would give gig economy workers the same rights as employed staff, appear to have been replaced with a pledge to consult on a simpler employment framework. Business leaders have raised concerns about some of the proposals such as the right for workers to disconnect from work or answer emails outside working hours. Union officials are also watching closely for any signs that the measures are being diluted or delayed, but most remain supportive of the plans."

            "date": "2024-09-22T15:00:14Z",
            "content": "Back when Jim Chalmers was negotiating with the Coalition to pass the government\u2019s Reserve Bank of Australia reforms he offered a key concession. Instead of proposing to abolish the power to overrule the RBA on the setting of interest rates, Labor was prepared instead to limit the power to \u201cemergency circumstances and not just differences of opinion\u201d. \u201cYou know, every time that there\u2019s an interest rate decision, for example, the Greens in their usual way will say that the parliament should override the decision,\u201d he said on 23 August. \u201cThat\u2019s a difference of opinion.\u201d The RBA meets again this week, with another decision on rates coming on Tuesday. Australia\u2019s curious mix of moderating inflation, weak growth but strong employment means we should prepare for more differences of opinion. Michele Bullock has said rate cuts are unlikely in the near term. But how the RBA assesses Australia\u2019s predicament could give clues about whether it will stick to its guns and wait until next year to begin cuts, or if there is something to economists\u2019 and market expectations that a cut this year is becoming more likely. The differences of opinion between the bank and the government are obvious from Chalmers\u2019 observation about rates \u201csmashing the economy\u201d and his rejection of the RBA chief economist Sarah Hunter\u2019s claim that the jobs market is \u201crunning too hot\u201d and exacerbating inflation. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email On Sunday Chalmers again said he doesn\u2019t \u201cthink that the data supported the view that the economy was running too hot\u201d. The Treasury expects the monthly inflation figure, out on Wednesday, will show it has \u201ccome down quite substantially\u201d, according to the treasurer, a shade over the target band of 2% to 3% \u2013 or even just within it. Chalmers said both the RBA and government are \u201ctrying to get on top of inflation without ignoring the risks to growth in our economy\u201d and \u201coverall, we\u2019re on the same page\u201d. So, the differences between the RBA and the government are slight. But between Labor and the Greens they are more stark. Since Chalmers\u2019 comments in August the Coalition has ruled itself out of supporting the RBA reforms, which would create a new board focused on setting interest rates, as distinct from its governance board. To pass the bill Labor will need the Greens, who have demanded that the government retain powers to overrule the bank on the cash rate, and that the RBA continue to be able to direct banks where to lend when it engages in quantitative easing. The Greens have no doubts about which way rates should be moving. On Monday the Greens Treasury spokesperson, Nick McKim, announced that the minor party would not help pass the bill until interest rates were cut. Note: their precondition is not that Chalmers come in over the top and overrule the RBA. An interest rate cut by the RBA will meet the Greens\u2019 condition. But this gives them possibly five months to highlight that they think mortgage-holders should get relief now. \u201cFor weeks the treasurer has acknowledged the economy is being smashed, and that mortgage holders are being smashed by high interest rates \u2013 yet to date he\u2019s done nothing about it despite having the power to reduce interest rates,\u201d McKim said. It\u2019s exactly the dynamic Chalmers had hoped to avoid: of independent RBA decisions being debated not just by economists, or between the bank and the government, but in the political sphere. He can thank the Coalition for once again driving Labor into a half-negotiation, half-cage fight on its left flank. Labor plays the politics just as hard. This month Anthony Albanese was asked about inflammatory Greens rhetoric that Labor had handed the RBA \u201ca box of matches and is now surprised it lit a fire on inflation\u201d. He replied that the Greens are \u201cirrelevant to serious economic policy debate in this country\u201d. On Thursday the prime minister said in the context of the housing impasse that the Coalition and Greens are both \u201cblockers\u201d. \u201cThey don\u2019t put forward practical plans,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the Greens case, they put forward things which are uncosted and unachievable. Really just the vibes of policies rather than serious ones.\u201d Albanese also levelled the \u201cuncosted\u201d charge at the Coalition over its nuclear policy, which is fair enough. Peter Dutton will give a major speech on the issue on Monday, which we understand still won\u2019t contain its expected cost. That\u2019s not the case for the Greens. When they have proposed a public property developer or raising billions from taxing excessive profits, their ideas were costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office. Labor can disagree with proposals to reform capital gains tax and negative gearing, which Albanese suggested on Thursday may harm supply. It can disagree with whether interest rates should be a political football. But by fighting to retain the power for the government to overrule the RBA, and in other areas of policy, the Greens will offer choice. Perhaps populist, perhaps not what Labor would call responsible. But not unserious. Differences of opinion on monetary policy will remain in the democratic sphere, not a purely technocratic affair."

            "title": "Mount Everest is having a growth spurt, say researchers",
            "date": "2024-09-30T15:00:04Z",
            "content": "Climbing Mount Everest has always been a feat, but it seems the task might be getting harder: researchers say Everest is having something of a growth spurt. The Himalayas formed about 50m years ago, when the Indian subcontinent smashed into the Eurasian tectonic plate \u2013 although recent research has suggested the edges of these plates were already very high before the collision. With the process still going on, the mountain range continues to be pushed upwards, though landslides and other events mean rock is also being lost. But now experts say Everest \u2013 which currently stands at 8,849m (29,032ft) \u2013 has been experiencing an additional boost to its height as a result of erosion by its neighbouring rivers. The team say the process has resulted in Everest rising an extra 15 to 50 metres over the last 89,000 years, with the uplift continuing today. \u201cOur study demonstrates that even the world\u2019s highest peak is subject to ongoing geological processes that can measurably affect its height over relatively short geological timescales,\u201d said Prof Jingen Dai, co-author of the study from China University of Geosciences in Beijing. Dai noted Everest is something of an anomaly, with its peak about 250 metres higher than the Himalayas\u2019 other tallest mountains. In addition, data has suggested a discrepancy between Everest\u2019s long-term and short-term rates of uplift. \u201cThis raised the question of whether there was an underlying mechanism making Everest\u2019s anomalous elevation even higher,\u201d said Dai. Writing in the journal Nature Geoscience, Dai and colleagues report how they created computer models to explore the evolution of river networks in the Himalayas. Their results suggest that about 89,000 years ago the upper reach of the Arun River that lies to the north of Everest \u2013 and which would have flowed eastward on the Tibetan plateau \u2013 merged with its lower reach, as a result of the latter eroding northward. The upshot was that the entire length of the Arun River became part of the Kosi River system. The team suggest the rerouting arising from this \u201criver capture\u201d resulted in an increase in river erosion near Everest, and the formation of the Arun River gorge. \u201cAt that time, there would be an enormous amount of additional water flowing through the Arun River, and this would have been able to transport more sediment and erode more bedrock, and cut down into the valley bottom,\u201d said Dr Matthew Fox, co-author of the research, from University College London. The researchers say the reduction in weight on the Earth\u2019s crust as this material was removed has led to an uplift of the surrounding land \u2013 a process known as isostatic rebound. The team estimates the process is propelling Everest upwards by about 0.16mm to 0.53mm a year, with its neighbouring peaks Lhotse and Makalu, the world\u2019s fourth and fifth highest peaks respectively, experiencing a similar uplift. \u201cThis effect will not continue indefinitely,\u201d said Dai. \u201cThe process will continue until the river system reaches a new equilibrium state.\u201d Prof Mika\u00ebl Attal of the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the work, said while river capture was a well-known phenomenon, it was relatively rare. \u201cWhat is unique in this study is the demonstration that erosion resulting from river capture can lead to such a dramatic response of the Earth\u2019s surface, with an area the size of Greater London going up a few tens of metres in tens of thousands of years, which is fast,\u201d he said. However, Attal notes this rebound only explains a fraction of the unusual height of the highest peaks of the Himalayas. Indeed, Fox noted other mechanisms such as tectonic stresses associated with earthquake cycles, and loss of mountain glaciers, could also cause uplift. Dr Elizabeth Dingle of Durham University said the study\u2019s findings could be important beyond Everest. \u201cThere are other river captures known to have occurred in the Himalaya,\u201d she said, \u201cSo it would be interesting to know whether similar effects are preserved elsewhere, or in other tectonically active mountain ranges more broadly.\u201d"

            "content": "UK house prices are growing at their fastest annual rate for nearly two years as borrowing costs continue to fall on expectations that the Bank of England will keep cutting interest rates, Nationwide has said. The building society said prices grew by 3.2% in September compared with the same month last year, well above the 2.4% annual growth recorded in August, and the fastest pace since the 4.4% recorded in November 2022. The average house price across the UK was \u00a3266,094 in September \u2013 a 0.7% month-on-month increase on August and only 2% below the all-time high prices recorded in the summer of 2022. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cIncome growth has continued to outstrip house price growth in recent months while borrowing costs have edged lower amid expectations that the Bank of England will continue to lower interest rates in the coming quarters. \u201cThese trends have helped to improve affordability for prospective buyers and underpinned a modest increase in activity and house prices, though both remain subdued by historic standards.\u201d Separate figures from the Bank showed a rise in monthly mortgage approvals to 64,900 in August from 62,500 in July, reflecting an uptick in housing market activity as borrowing costs fall and real wage growth remains resilient. Net mortgage lending rose to \u00a32.9bn, up by about \u00a3100m compared with the previous month. Borrowing on consumer credit increased from \u00a31.2bn to \u00a31.3bn, in a development that economists said reflected strength in household finances. \u201c[This] remains consistent with our view that consumer spending growth will strengthen over the coming quarters,\u201d said Ashley Webb, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. The Office for National Statistics said the household saving ratio \u2013 a measure of the proportion of disposable income that is not spent on consumption \u2013 rose to 10% in the second quarter, up from 8.9% in the first three months of the year. However, it warned that the UK economy grew by less than it previously estimated between April and June. Gross domestic product increased by 0.5%, down from an initial estimate of 0.6%, after output in manufacturing and construction fell by more than first thought. Mortgage lenders have been dropping their rates on new product deals in recent months on the prospect of further cuts to the cost of borrowing after the Bank of England reduced its base rate from 5.25% to 5% in August, its first cut since March 2020. Despite holding rates unchanged at its most recent policy meeting earlier this month, the Bank signalled borrowing costs were \u201cnow gradually on the path down\u201d from the highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis. Lenders such as Nationwide, Halifax and HSBC are now offering five-year fixed rates at below 4% for buyers for the first time since the start of the year. Banks have also started lending more to borrowers in the last month, with Nationwide announcing last week it would start to offer first-time buyers loans at six times their annual household income. Lloyds and Halifax have recently upped their borrowing limits to 5.5 times household incomes. The Nationwide figures, which also recorded performance over the third quarter of the year, showed that the increase in house prices in the north of England over that period outpaces those in the south. The average house price across the three months to September 2024 grew by 3.1% in the north of England year-on-year, compared with 1.3% in the south. Northern Ireland recorded the biggest increase across the period, with an 8.6% growth in house prices, while Scotland experienced a 4.3% increase. Wales recorded a 2.5% rise. Terrace houses continued to show the biggest annual increases in prices, with the average cost up by 3.5% in September. The average price for a flat increased by 2.7%."

            "content": "Gym-goers who want to pump the heaviest weights might figure that bulging thighs and bulky buttocks are the path to greater power. But a study involving one of the world\u2019s strongest men found that a set of slender, rope-like muscles that typically get far less attention could be more important than previously thought. Scientists at Loughborough University\u2019s school of sport, exercise and health sciences examined the rippling sinews of Eddie Hall, a Staffordshire truck mechanic nicknamed \u201cthe Beast\u201d who became the world\u2019s strongest man in 2017. They discovered that after his 15 years of continuous training, a set of long, thin muscles in his legs were up to three times the size of those in men who do no strength training. To their surprise, they found that these muscles in Hall \u2013 linking from below the knee up to the pelvis \u2013 showed the greatest development compared with mere mortals who do not spend any time developing extreme strength. They are known as \u201cguy rope\u201d muscles and they stabilise the pelvis and thigh bone. The scientific name of these less understood powerhouses are the sartorius, gracilis and semitendinosus, and they helped Hall achieve a world record 500kg deadlift in 2020 \u2013 equivalent to lifting a camel from the floor. Relative to untrained men, these muscles demonstrated the largest differences in mass of any that were examined in laboratory conditions. Some of his other muscles and tendons \u2013 for example, the patella tendon in the knee and the hip flexors \u2013 were far less out of the ordinary. \u201cThese muscles have had very little attention scientifically, so we don\u2019t really know how important they are in different tasks,\u201d said Jonathan Folland, a professor of neuromuscular performance. \u201cBut to find that they were really very well developed in someone who has spent decades lifting and carrying heavy loads \u2013 and is very good at that \u2013 was really interesting. These muscles clearly are more important for lifting and carrying very heavy loads than we previously thought.\u201d Dr Tom Balshaw, a lecturer in kinesiology, strength and conditioning at Loughborough, said it may be possible that targeted exercises, including hip rotations and knee flexing, could boost the \u201cguy rope\u201d muscles independently of squats and other, more common exercises that also appear to work. Hall has bench-pressed 300kg and achieved a world record 216kg on the axle press, which requires a huge barbell to be lifted from the ground and held above the head. After that milestone, a pumped Hall declared: \u201cDon\u2019t ever, ever put a limit on what I can do, because I will prove you wrong every single time.\u201d Hall is available to hire for events and will appear in a 1960s British army tank painted with his \u201cBeast\u201d logo for \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,000 a time. The study comes amid a boom in gym use among young men and women. It has sparked concerns about the effect of \u201cgymfluencers\u201d and fears that constant comparison with ideal bodies could can cause mental health problems. A report by PureGym said 42% of 16-24-year-olds increased their spending on exercise last year. Just how different Hall is from the general population was made clear when the scientists at Loughborough measured his individual muscles. The quadriceps in his thighs were more than double the size of those of an untrained man and 18% larger than the next biggest the team had ever assessed, in an elite sprinter. Hall\u2019s hamstrings were twice the size of the untrained population\u2019s and his biceps femoris, a large muscle in the back of the thigh, was two to three times larger. In June, two slender TikTok influencers, Jamil and Jamel Neffati, had a closeup view of Hall\u2019s extreme dimensions after they signed up to fight him simultaneously at a mixed martial art event in Blackburn called the \u201cWorld Freak Fight League\u201d. Since the Neffatis each weighed less than half as much as Hall, his victory was never in doubt. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 September 2024. An earlier version said that Eddie Hall\u2019s 500kg deadlift was \u201cequivalent to hoisting a camel over his head\u201d. In fact a deadlift is picking up a weight from the ground to hip level, rather than over your head."

            "date": "2024-09-19T02:47:30Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s economy added more jobs than expected in August as the unemployment rate remained steady, making a Reserve Bank interest rate cut less likely in the short term. The jobless rate in August was 4.2%, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on Thursday. Economists had it expected it to remain in line with the 4.2% in July. Employers added a net 47,500 jobs last month compared with the 26,000 economists had predicted. Of the added jobs, more than 50,000 were part time, with 3,100 full-time roles shed. Signs of strength in the job market included a 0.4% increase in the number of hours worked to 1.962bn, said Kate Lamb, head of labour statistics at the ABS. \u201cThe proportion of people working reduced hours because they were sick continues to be above pre-pandemic levels,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cHowever, the proportion of people working less hours than usual due to economic reasons, such as no work or less work available, is below pre-pandemic levels, which points to continued relative tightness in the labour market.\u201d The participation rate, one measure of the share of the population in work or looking for employment, remained at its record level of 67.1%. \u201cThe economy is soft and people are under pressure and that\u2019s why we are pleased to see we are still creating jobs and opportunities for more Australians than ever,\u201d the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said in a statement. The Albanese government revised its previous estimates that it was close to ticking past the mark of 1m new jobs since taking office in May 2022. It now puts the gain at almost 978,000. The labour market will be a key gauge of whether the economy remains aloft after 13 RBA interest rate hikes or suffers a hard stall, as happened after previous bursts of inflation. The central bank last week indicated that it viewed current conditions to be \u201cabove\u201d full employment with jobless rate needing to rise to ensure inflation\u2019s retreat continued. However, most rich nations are now cutting interest rates, including the US Federal Reserve, which made its first reduction in four years on Wednesday. Weakening employment figures in Australia would be one signal for the RBA to sharpen its rate cut axe. Prior to Thursday\u2019s figures, financial markets were betting the RBA would leave its cash rate unchanged at its two-day board meeting next week on Monday and Tuesday. Investors were only expecting the first 25 basis point cut to 4.1% by February, according to the ASX. After the release of the jobs data, the Australian dollar remained steady near 67.5 US cents, while the ASX200 benchmark share index was also little moved to be flat for the day. Brendan Rynne, KPMG\u2019s chief economist, said the latest data \u201conce again shows the resilience of the Australian labour market despite a slowing economy\u201d. \u201cNext week\u2019s monthly CPI data should show inflation falling, but it is still KPMG\u2019s expectation that the RBA won\u2019t start to cut the cash rate until early next year, when inflation is expected to be safely within the [2%-3%] target band,\u201d Rynne said. Separately, the latest ACCI/Westpac business survey, released on Thursday, found \u201ca net 13.1% of respondents indicated that labour was more \u2018difficult to find\u2019 in the September quarter, a modest increase from the net 11.7% in Q2\u201d. Among the major states, New South Wales\u2019s jobless rate crept up to 4.1% from 4.0% in July. Queensland, which goes to the polls next month, saw its unemployment rate ease 0.1 percentage points to 4.2%, with Victoria posting a similar improvement to 4.5%. Western Australia, South Australia and the ACT all posted jobless rates of 3.9% in August, the lowest in the nation. Australia\u2019s jobless rate compares with the UK\u2019s 4.1% and New Zealand\u2019s at 4.6%, both in June. The European Union\u2019s was a hefty 6.4% (in July) and Canada\u2019s 6.4% (in August), according to The Economist."

            "title": "What will a Federal Reserve interest rate cut mean for you?",
            "date": "2024-09-18T18:11:59Z",
            "content": "The Federal Reserve announced a half-percentage point interest-rate cut on Wednesday, the first decrease in four years. It\u2019s a moment that many economists see as the end of an era, and the beginning of the end of the central bank\u2019s fight against inflation. The Fed\u2019s prime rate \u2013 used to set the rates on everything from mortgages to car loans \u2013 has sat at a 20-year high for the last year, making it more expensive to borrow money. This rate cut is a big deal for the economy. But it\u2019ll take some time for American consumers to feel the effects. Here\u2019s what to expect. Why is the Fed cutting rates? The Fed primarily looks at two things when considering the interest rate: inflation and the labor markets. Balancing price increases with unemployment is what the Fed refers to as its \u201cdual mandate\u201d \u2013 ensuring that inflation doesn\u2019t get too high and that unemployment stays at a low level. Following years of pandemic-related turmoil in the economy \u2013 waves of unemployment followed by massive stimuli from the federal government and various supply chain issues \u2013 inflation began to rapidly increase starting in 2022, topping at 9.1% in June 2022. The Fed hiked rates 11 times over a period of about a year and a half, from March 2022 until July 2023, the last time it increased rates. Since then, inflation has come down to 2.5% \u2013 still above the Fed\u2019s target of 2% but a significant slowdown since its peak. The labor market has remained strong but has started to cool. Unemployment hit historic lows as prices were increasing, but this year the unemployment rate went up to 4% for the first time since January 2022. Employers also seemed to be adding less jobs to the economy every month, a rapid cooling that had some worried that the country could be heading toward a recession. As the most recent inflation and jobs data seemed to both show cooling, Fed officials started signaling late in the summer that it was time to cut rates. \u201cThe time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear,\u201d Powell said in August during closely watched remarks. When will we start to feel the effects of the rate cuts? Though the new interest rates will go into effect immediately, it will take a while for any tangible effects to trickle down into different parts of the economy. Perhaps the most immediate effects were seen before the Fed actually cut rates. The highly responsive and volatile US stock market hit record highs at closing on Monday and Tuesday as investors prepared for the Fed\u2019s rate cut. \u201cThe adjustment for consumers in general is less instantaneous than something like market prices. If you\u2019re in trading and securities, you can immediately adjust the price. A lot of [consumer] contracts are longer lasting,\u201d said Anastassia Fedyk, assistant professor of finance at the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Haas school of business. \u201cIt takes a while to trickle through the economy.\u201d Fedyk pointed out that it\u2019s been more than a year since the Fed last raised interest rates, but the effects are still being seen. The inflation rate was 2.5% in August, down from 3.7% in August 2023, a month after the Fed last raised interest rates. The new interest rate \u201cgoes into effect immediately, but in terms of when it trickles through the economy, that can take some time. That\u2019s why we\u2019re continuing to see a cooling down in inflation numbers, even though the Fed has not raised rates for a long time,\u201d Fedyk said. Will mortgage rates go down? Yes, but it will happen slowly. The good news for homebuyers is that the average rate already started to fall this year in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s rate cut. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate peaked at 7.79% in 2023 and has now dropped to below 6.5% \u2013 still double the rate seen in 2021, but a sign of easing nonetheless. Still, it\u2019ll take some time for interest rates to have a major effect on the housing market. \u201cFor existing mortgages, unless people are going to refinance, that\u2019s not going to have an effect, as long as there is demand,\u201d Fedyk said. Even though it will be cheaper for banks to borrow money, \u201cthere are a lot of market forces that have to play out there to get those things over to the consumer.\u201d What about other types of loans? Some loans may get cheaper over time, but many depend on other factors, like a person\u2019s credit score. Auto loans track closely to the path of the Fed\u2019s interest rates, but are also influenced by a person\u2019s credit history and the vehicle. Credit card debt, which is already one of the more expensive loans to have, will also get slightly cheaper, though not by much. Most student loans are not affected by interest rates as the vast majority are from the federal government, which has its own interest rates on student loans that are not tied to the Fed. Will there be more rate cuts? The Fed likes to move slowly and steadily. It took 11 meetings for the Fed to get from 0%, the interest rate during the early pandemic, up to a high of 5.5%. Going back down, the Fed will likely not cut rates by more than half a point per meeting. But economists say that this meeting marks the beginning of a new era of Fed cuts. \u201cThis Fed tends to be fairly cautious, data-driven and it\u2019s unlikely that this is going to be a one-off,\u201d Fedyk said. \u201cThis likely will be the start of a gradual decline in rates in months of course, so that of course will mean we\u2019re going to continue seeing effects in the future.\u201d What are the wider global effects? Lowering the cost of borrowing reduces the payments US firms and consumers make on mortgages and loans for US business and consumers, and easing economic pressures on households, could influence the outcome of November\u2019s presidential election. A rate cut will also weaken the dollar, which has fallen against most major currencies \u2013 including the pound \u2013 over the past year in anticipation of the Fed decision. A weaker dollar will make it easier for US firms to export, but the broader improvement to the global economic outlook will benefit the global economy. There are increasing signs the world\u2019s biggest economy could be heading into recession next year, after some of the biggest US manufacturers laid off workers and the S&amp;P 500 index of leading company shares hit a ceiling in July. If the Fed can avert this, the economic benefits will be global."

As inflation continues to fade in the US, policymakers at the Fed also expect to cut rates by an additional 50 basis points this year, according to projections released alongside this week\u2019s announcement. Some analysts said the market could be relieved that Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, was able to thread the needle in his press conference and suggest the deeper-than-usual cut was just a \u201crecalibration\u201d of policy and not an urgent move it had to take to prevent a recession. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything in the economy that suggests the likelihood of a downturn is elevated,\u201d Powell told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t see that.\u201d The FTSE 100 climbed 0.9% in London after the Bank of England opted to hold interest rates steady.

            "content": "More voters are blaming the Albanese government for interest rate rises but Labor appears to have hit the electoral sweet spot with its proposed cap on international student enrolments. Those are the conclusions of the latest Guardian Essential poll of 1,132 voters conducted after a week of debate about whether the Reserve Bank should begin cutting interest rates due to extremely soft growth. After 13 interest rate rises since May 2022, the poll found that most voters (58%) blamed this round of contractionary monetary policy on \u201cprices going up\u201d, about the same percentage as when the question was asked in February 2023. The federal government was the second-most popular source of blame for rate rises, with 44% blaming it, up from 31% in February 2023 and 38% in June 2023. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The result underscores the political difficulty for Labor, as the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, warns that interest rates are \u201csmashing the economy\u201d in an attempt to encourage the RBA to cut rates or distance the government from decisions to keep them on hold. The other factors presented were: the RBA \u201coverreacting\u201d (blamed by 37% of respondents); \u201cdisruptions in supply chains triggered by the pandemic\u201d (32%); the war in Ukraine (22%); and wages rising too quickly (21%). Respondents were also asked about proposed new questions for the 2026 census, after the government had backed down to include sexuality but before the further backdown to also include gender identity. Forty-two per cent of voters said the census should ask about both gender and sexuality; while one-quarter (25%) said it should ask about neither topic; 23% favoured a question about gender but not sexual orientation; and 10% wanted one on sexual orientation but not gender. A majority of respondents (53%) said the Albanese government\u2019s plan to cap international student enrolments in tertiary education at 270,000 in 2025 had got the number \u201cabout right\u201d. A bit over a third (37%) said this was still \u201ctoo high\u201d and just 10% said it was \u201ctoo low\u201d. In a forced-choice question, most voters (69%) agreed with the government\u2019s rationale for the policy \u201cto reduce the number of international students using courses as a backdoor to live and work in Australia\u201d rather than universities\u2019 views that \u201ccapping the number of international students will make study for local students more expensive and undermine our international reputation\u201d (31%). In a separate question, more than half of respondents agreed with propositions that \u201cuniversities should be responsible for the impact of overseas students such as providing accommodation\u201d (59%) and that \u201cinternational students are good for the Australian economy by providing income and workers\u201d (52%). About half of respondents agreed that \u201cincome from international students is important because it helps to fund degrees for local students\u201d (50%) and that \u201cinternational students build stronger ties between Australia and other nations\u201d (49%). Respondents were asked about how important various industries are in driving Australia\u2019s wealth. Education topped the list, with 78% of respondents describing it as either \u201cabsolutely essential\u201d or \u201cvery important\u201d. Majorities also backed \u201chealth and care sectors\u201d (75%), manufacturing (75%), science and technology (72%), and mining and resources (69%), results which could help Labor make the argument for its Future Made in Australia package including critical minerals production tax credits. \u201cArts and culture\u201d was bottom of the list, rated as \u201cabsolutely essential\u201d or \u201cvery important\u201d by just 34% of voters. Tertiary education in Australia was highly rated by respondents, with a majority describing Tafe as good or very good (62%), while 60% said the same of universities. Results were slightly lower for childcare and early learning (51%), infants and primary school (50%) and high school (49%). Respondents were asked to rank four objectives of the education system. Ensuring \u201cstudents have basic literacy and numeracy\u201d was the top priority for 38% of respondents, followed by \u201cthe health and wellbeing of young Australians\u201d (29%), \u201cthat students leave with the ability to think critically\u201d (18%) and \u201cthat students have the skills to get a good job\u201d (15%)."

            "content": "The European Central Bank has lowered interest rates for the second time this year, as it warned that economic growth in the eurozone will be weaker than it had hoped. The ECB\u2019s governing council decided to lower its deposit rate \u2013 paid to banks that make overnight deposits with the Eurosystem \u2013 by a quarter of a percentage point, from 3.75% to 3.5%, on Thursday. The move was expected, as inflation in the eurozone fell to 2.2% in August, down from 2.6% in July and near the ECB\u2019s 2% target. In a sign that Europe\u2019s economic recovery is faltering, the ECB lowered its forecast for GDP growth this year from 0.9% to 0.8%. For 2025, growth expectations were trimmed from 1.4% to 1.3%, and from 1.6% to 1.5% in 2026. The ECB said it eased borrowing costs because \u201cinflation is gradually coming down and has been developing as we expected\u201d. The central bank\u2019s economists expect inflation to increase in the latter part of this year, saying \u201cwages are still rising at an elevated pace\u201d, before dropping in 2025 and 2026. Thursday\u2019s cut follows June\u2019s quarter-point cut to the deposit rate, which the ECB had raised to a record high of 4% after inflation soared across Europe in 2022 and 2023. The ECB was coy about whether it would lower rates again at its next meeting in October. Its president, Christine Lagarde, told reporters in Frankfurt that \u201cwe are not pre-committing to a particular rate path \u2026 We are going to decide meeting by meeting. I\u2019m not giving you any commitment of any kind as far as that particular date is concerned and our path is not predetermined at all.\u201d She said the slowdown in Germany\u2019s economy \u2013 currently on the brink of recession \u2013 had been included in the ECB\u2019s latest growth forecasts. Kathleen Brooks, the research director at XTB, said the financial markets expected more cuts from the ECB this year. \u201cThe problem for the ECB is that financial markets do not seem to believe that they are still undecided about the future of monetary policy,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThe interest rate futures market is still pricing in 60 basis points of rate cuts for the rest of this year, with rate cuts expected in October and in December.\u201d Investors are expecting the US Federal Reserve to start easing policy next week, with a quarter-point cut to its benchmark interest rate. The Bank of England also meets next week, but is expected to delay a second cut to the UK rate until November."

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cWe need more people to use AI and to do that we need to build trust\u201d by creating a regulatory framework, he said. Long the stuff of science fiction, generative artificial intelligence \u2013 which can create new content such as text, images, audio and code \u2013 has experienced a surge in uptake through \u201clarge language model\u201d programs such as ChatGPT, Google\u2019s chatbot Bard and Microsoft Bing\u2019s chat feature. AI is already throwing up challenges to lawmakers and consumers, from misleading people on prices, alleged defamation from false claims served up by chat programs to warnings from the eSafety commissioner that generative AI could automate child grooming by predators. The paper notes while AI can \u201cimprove wellbeing and quality of life\u201d its potential for harms include creating and amplifying bias; physical or psychological injury; breach of privacy; and threatening national security through information manipulation and malicious cyber activity. The paper proposes to define high-risk AI to \u201cintended and foreseeable uses\u201d and the \u201cunforeseeable risks\u201d created by general-purpose AI, which \u201ccan be applied in contexts they were not originally designed for\u201d. Under the 10 guardrails, organisations developing or deploying high-risk AI would need to establish risk management processes; test AI and monitor once deployed; enable human control or intervention to achieve meaningful human oversight; inform end-users of AI decisions, interactions and content; and establish processes for people affected by AI systems to challenge use or outcomes. Organisations should also be required to \u201ckeep and maintain records to allow third parties to assess compliance with guardrails\u201d and undertake tests to certify their own compliance, it said. Once settled, the guardrails could be applied within existing regulations, through amendments to legislation in separate domains or through \u201ca new cross-economy AI act\u201d, as the EU moved to do in June. That option would enable the creation of an independent AI regulator, although this would \u201ctake resources and time\u201d, the paper said. Husic said Australians want stronger protections on AI and businesses had also been calling for greater clarity around using AI safely. \u201cFrom today, we\u2019re starting to put those protections in place,\u201d he said. The paper noted the government plans to \u201cstrengthen privacy protections, transparency and accountability\u201d, a reference to the privacy law reform package expected to be unveiled as early as next week. The attorney general\u2019s department is also working on a \u201cwhole of government legal framework to support use of automated decision-making systems\u201d, which was a recommendation from the robodebt royal commission."

            "date": "2024-09-09T14:32:29Z",
            "content": "The oil and gas supermajor BP is to use artificial intelligence to speed up the decision-making of its engineers, after signing a five-year deal with the US spy technology company Palantir. The British company plans to use large language models to automatically analyse data from its sites and produce advice to help humans come to conclusions. The new deal builds on a decade-long partnership during which Palantir\u2019s tech has been used to create a \u201cdigital twin\u201d of BP\u2019s oil and gas operations, including in the Khazzan gasfields in Oman and on offshore oil platforms in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, the site of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster at a BP well. The companies said the existing partnership had helped improve performance, and that the new software was designed for \u201csafe and reliable AI deployment\u201d and to \u201cguard against hallucinations\u201d. That is a reference to how generative AI models have in the past presented untrue or invented claims as fact as a result of issues with the data it is trained on or how it combines that information \u2013 a phenomenon termed hallucination. The use of generative AI is becoming increasingly common across every industry, from adapting the language used to address shoppers at Marks &amp; Spencer to helping researchers and writers. Debate continues to rage over whether AI will replace or improve existing jobs. Sunjay Pandey, the senior vice-president for digital delivery at BP, said: \u201cThe use of advanced digital twin simulations helps us to safely monitor and optimise various aspects of the production process to enhance operational performance. We look forward to building on the progress we have made over the years.\u201d Matthew Babin at Palantir said its tech \u201coffers the opportunity to help accelerate human decision-making on top of the robust digital twin and deep operational workflows already in place\u201d. The tech company won a five-year contract last year to create a huge data platform for the NHS \u2013 a move that sparked privacy concerns over patients\u2019 medical details. Peter Thiel, Palantir\u2019s billionaire founder and chair, backed Donald Trump at the 2016 presidential election, and the company is known for working closely with intelligence agencies and military organisations including the CIA and UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence. BP is beefing up its technology under the chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, who took the job after the shock departure of Bernard Looney last year. The \u00a366bn company struck a deal last month with the US space agency Nasa to share their technology and expertise gained from working \u201cin hostile environments\u201d. In 2019, the company invested $5m (\u00a33.8m) in Belmont Technology to accelerate its AI platform, nicknamed Sandy."

            "date": "2024-09-18T17:00:10Z",
            "content": "The valves opened, the sea gurgled in and slowly, imperceptibly at first, the ship began its journey to the bottom of the Atlantic. The 60-metre MV Shingle debuted in Ireland a decade ago as a smuggling vessel, but then became an unwanted hulk. On Wednesday afternoon it performed its swan song \u2013 scuttled off County Mayo to create an artificial reef. A flotilla of smaller boats with spectators circled and a drone fed live footage to YouTube, providing an audience for the sunlit scene off Killala Bay. Authorities hope the wreck, from its new home on the seabed, will enhance the ecosystem and boost tourism by enticing divers to Ireland\u2019s west coast. It might also redeem a cargo vessel associated with crime. In June 2014 armed police and customs officers intercepted the Moldovan-registered ship, which had sailed from Slovenia via Portugal, as it neared the port of Drogheda, north of Dublin. The Europe-wide security operation netted 32m cigarettes and four tonnes of tobacco apparently destined for the hidden market. It also created a headache for Irish revenue officials who were left with a rusting, asbestos-tainted vessel. Nobody wanted to buy it and scrapping it was prohibitively expensive. So it sat in Dublin port for nine years and then last year was towed to New Ross port, no longer seaworthy. A Mayo-based campaign group called Killala Bay Ships 2 Reef persuaded Mayo and Sligo county councils that the ship could create an artificial marine reef \u2013 Ireland\u2019s first \u2013 and benefit marine life and tourism. The group said it wished to create an \u201cAtlantic underwater oasis\u201d. Many sunken wrecks around the world teem with marine life including coral, eels, snappers and sharks, according to Smithsonian Ocean. Revenue officials agreed to donate a vessel, which since being seized has cost about \u20ac2m in berthing fees, maintenance and remedial work, including the removal of asbestos and residual oils. Michael Loftus, a Mayo councillor and diver who led the initiative, said the project had been a \u201clong and hard road\u201d. He hopes the wreck will generate income and spur research. \u201cWe expect that this money they have spent on it will be paid back within a three-year period from diving, tourism, fishing tourism, marine research,\u201d he told RT\u00c9. The Shingle was towed from New Ross and arrived at Killala Bay on Tuesday. About a dozen dinghies and other small boats accompanied the former cargo vessel on its last voyage on Wednesday. Soon after 3pm, about 2km from shore, its valve tanks were opened. Nothing appeared to happen at first. After an hour it was visibly lower in the water. It sank lower and listed to its starboard side, the ocean claiming the bow. The end came just before 5pm, and was swift: in a few seconds the bridge plunged beneath the water, producing foam which bubbled and swirled, then vanished, leaving calm, placid water. The ship rested on the seabed 29 metres (95ft) below."

The panel will discuss worries over the role AI could play in this year\u2019s elections and beyond, including manipulated or deepfaked media and false information spread on platforms. These disruptions could increase as the November elections near. KQED\u2019s Rachael Myrow and the Guardian\u2019s Rachel Leingang will moderate the conversation with California state senator Scott Wiener, California Common Cause executive director Jonathan Mehta Stein, and Encode Justice founder Sneha Revanur. In an ongoing series, the Guardian has covered some of the threats AI poses on elections and the potential it has to disrupt or confuse the voting process \u2013 as well as the ways the mere threat of what AI could do might lead to voters doubting whether something is real or faked. AI-generated material has already shown up in US elections, starting with a robocall before the New Hampshire primaries where a faked voice of Joe Biden told people not to vote. The company that sent the call agreed to a $1m fine, while the person who orchestrated it faces criminal charges and a $6m fine. Elon Musk, the owner of social media platform X, has shared AI-generated content, including a video that faked Kamala Harris\u2019s voice and a photo of the vice-president in a communist uniform. The platform\u2019s AI chatbot, Grok, has spread false information about elections. As part of the Bots v Ballots series, the Guardian has detailed how AI\u2019s advancement outpaces attempts to regulate it, and what that means for voters, and investigated an AI-based tool that would allow people to file mass challenges to voters\u2019 eligibility, potentially preventing eligible people from casting ballots. The Guardian also created deepfake audio to show how easy it is to make and how hard it can be for people to distinguish, and talked to deepfake detection experts to understand what we should look for when analyzing a piece of media. And the Guardian reported on how a lawmaker used an AI chatbot to write a bill that regulates AI in elections."

            "content": "The testimonies are not just of human tragedy but of total disregard for human life. Moussa, a migrant from Guinea, explains: \u201cThere was a pregnant woman and they beat her until blood started coming from between her legs. She passed out.\u201d A Guardian investigation published on Thursday reveals harrowing stories of abuse of refugees by the Tunisian national guard, including beatings, rape and abandoning people in the desert, as well as collusion with people smugglers. The Tunisian authorities rejected the allegations. Widespread and systematic human rights abuses happen in Libya too and have been going on for many years, well documented by the UN. In September last year the British government\u2019s representatives said they were deeply concerned and, in a statement quietly released at the UN security council, called for these abuses to end. Given Keir Starmer\u2019s background as a human rights lawyer, his commitment at the European Political Community (EPC) summit to show a \u201cprofound respect for international law\u201d and his principled and resolute opposition to the Rwanda scheme, it appears surprising that the prime minister chose this week to give so much attention to the controversial deals made by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, with the regimes in Libya and Tunisia to reduce the number of people crossing the Mediterranean to seek safety in her country. For Starmer, it is what he said in his opening comments at the EPC meeting before he emphasised upholding international law that appears to be particularly important: the \u201cpursuit of solutions that will actually deliver results\u201d. In comments made after meeting Meloni, he told the Times: \u201cIt\u2019s about the politics of pragmatism.\u201d The global charity led by the former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, International Rescue Committee, rightly did not hesitate to urge the prime minister not to prioritise such \u201ccostly and ultimately ineffective deterrence policies\u201d. Home Office ministers will say that in seeking solutions it is not necessary to be ideological bedfellows with other countries, and there is nothing wrong with wanting to learn from them: the government simply wants to look at what can be done to prevent people leaving their country in the first place. Part of what should be a multi-pronged approach to ending the loss of life in the Channel \u2013 45 people have perished this year compared with 12 last year \u2013 is certainly focusing on providing support to refugees to stay closer to home and addressing the reasons why they are fleeing. This does not have to be achieved by arrangements involving vast sums of money and repressive regimes, such as Tunisia and Libya. Officials in the Foreign Office have proposed a more \u201cholistic approach\u201d to tackle the drivers of migration across Africa and the western Mediterranean. This involves something more akin to the deep commitment made in 1997 by the well-respected late Labour foreign secretary, Robin Cook, to an \u201cethical foreign policy\u201d that uses aid and diplomacy without supporting authoritarian governments. Much more also needs to be done to target aid to help refugees displaced by brutal wars in countries such as Sudan stay safely in the region, in the way Ukrainians were supported to stay in Poland when millions fled there soon after the Russian invasion. This is not an either/or option: focusing only on preventing people from having to take dangerous journeys or trying to deal fairly with those who arrive in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. It should always be both. For that is what Britain pledged to respect in the aftermath of the second world war, when it joined other nations \u2013 horrified by a lack of effective international protection for those seeking sanctuary \u2013 to find ways to uphold an international order that respected everyone\u2019s humanity, including those crossing borders to flee from war and persecution. The 1951 UN refugee convention was the outcome, and Labour pledged to respect this incredibly important part of our international order. Those coming across the Channel seeking asylum are from countries such as Afghanistan, Iran, Eritrea, Syria and Sudan, which means it is very likely their applications will be accepted. They pay people smugglers and take dangerous journeys because they have no other option. They cannot buy a plane ticket to fly to the UK because they are not allowed to enter with a visa and then apply for asylum. They cannot fly to join family or relatives already in the UK, who are desperate to be reunited with them. They can only dice with death across land and sea. That is why there must also be more safe routes, as well as enforcement action to stop the gangs and greater upstream activity. The anxiety inside government is that expanding these routes will upset the parts of the electorate who are particularly anxious about the number of people coming to the UK seeking asylum. But the response to these anxieties, particularly after the far-right violence in the summer that targeted asylum accommodation, should be to dial up the importance of what Barack Obama, in seeking to set out an alternative patriotism to that of Donald Trump, called his nation\u2019s \u201cbonds of affection\u201d. The historian Simon Schama described this view of America as being \u201ca community of inclusion rather than a fortress of exclusion\u201d. The UK is also a place where mutual respect, care and decency prevail \u2013 epitomised in the public taking to the streets to clear up after the riots. That\u2019s why for many decades in our neighbourhoods, schools and workplaces, refugees have been welcomed and integrated and became part of British life. Governing should, first and foremost, be about upholding the values that matter most. For Labour, those have always been a commitment to international law, respecting human rights and inclusion for all, including refugees and people seeking asylum. Now is not the time to compromise on those principles. Enver Solomon is chief executive of the Refugee Council"

Official advice has been warning British nationals to leave the country for months. But with the escalation of tension following the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, there have been fresh appeals to Brits to urgently secure a place on a flight. Commercial flights are still operating and Foreign Office officials have been working to increase the number available for British nationals. There have also been appeals for them to register their presence in the country with the government. The embassy is also being aided by an emergency team attempting to make contact with British people known to be in the country. Official advice to leave the country has actually been in place since October last year, citing the risks arising for the conflict taking place in Gaza. The latest government assessment states that \u201ctensions are high and events could escalate with little warning, which could affect or limit exit routes out of Lebanon\u201d. Many airlines stopped flying to Lebanon as Israel intensified its offensive, and the few flights still leaving Beirut are sold out. But not all the Britons in Beirut want to leave.

            "content": "Kemi Badenoch, Robert Jenrick, James Cleverly and Tom Tugendhat will be using the first Conservative conference since their party\u2019s defeat to make their pitches to members on why they should succeed Rishi Sunak. The former prime minister has urged Tories to \u201clearn the lessons\u201d and \u201creflect\u201d on their period in government. However, the first day of the party conference has already descended into bickering over statutory maternity pay and how long the contest should be. Amid all the noise, here is a short summary of what the leadership hopefuls stand for in policymaking. Immigration Robert Jenrick He would like parliament to set a \u201clegally binding\u201d cap on migration, with a hope of that being \u201cin the tens of thousands of lower\u201d. He resigned from his position as immigration minister in Rishi Sunak\u2019s government last December, noting the Rwanda plan \u201cwas not strong enough\u201d. Kemi Badenoch She believes that \u201cnot all cultures are equally valid\u201d when it comes to deciding who should be allowed into the UK. She has said the UK should leave international frameworks such as the European court of human rights \u201cif necessary\u201d, but she insists there will be no \u201csilver bullet\u201d to solve Britain\u2019s \u201cbroken\u201d system. James Cleverly Cleverly also believes making promises to leave the ECHR offers the public nothing but \u201csoundbites and quick fixes\u201d. Tom Tugendhat Tugendhat has said Britain needs lower migration and has pledged to introduce a legally binding annual cap of 100,000 if he becomes Tory leader. He would also like to derogate from \u201ccertain aspects\u201d of the ECHR, to leave parts of it, and to reform it. Economy Robert Jenrick Jenrick believes the country needs \u201ca tax system that rewards risk-takers\u201d and should \u201ctake advantage of our Brexit freedoms and change VAT thresholds\u201d for small businesses. He has said \u201cwe should increase the thresholds to \u00a3100,000, as recommended by the Federation of Small Businesses, which would allow tens of thousands of businesses to have an additional untaxed turnover of \u00a310,000\u201d. Jenrick argues for a much smaller state. He very nearly indicated that he would accept a hit to the economy in order to ensure he could cut immigration. The leadership hopeful believes the fastest way for the economy to grow is to build more homes and infrastructure. Kemi Badenoch Badenoch says businesses are closing because \u201cthe burden of regulation is too high\u201d. She said, sparking a huge row over the cost of maternity pay: \u201cWe need to allow businesses, especially small businesses, to make more of their own decisions. The exact amount of maternity pay, in my view, is neither here nor there.\u201d She has previously said Britain\u2019s colonialism did not help the country\u2019s economic growth. James Cleverly Cleverly hopes to increase housing supply, incentivise work, cut taxes and free business of unnecessary regulation. Tom Tugendhat Tugendhat has said he wants to see \u201cthe blood of the economy flowing again\u201d and believes only a \u201cConservative revolution\u201d, delivering \u201ca higher wage, lower migration economy can do this\u201d. Foreign policy Robert Jenrick Jenrick says the Conservatives have good links with the Republicans in the US, and noted how \u201cnatural\u201d it would be for him to lean towards the presidential candidate Donald Trump. He has previously expressed his strong support for Trump but did not do so on the first day of the Tory conference. Kemi Badenoch If she were already Tory leader, Badenoch said she would be congratulating Benjamin Netanyahu after Israeli forces assassinated the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Badenoch believes Israel has a right to defend itself and says she could work with Trump or with Kamala Harris if she were leader, but refused to say who she would vote for. James Cleverly Nine years ago, Cleverly tweeted: \u201cDear Republican colleagues, please, please, please don\u2019t choose Donald Trump as the front man for American Right-of-Centre politics. Please.\u201d He has since been on a long journey, refusing to say he would vote for Trump but noting that his \u201cparticular rhetorical style\u201d is effective. He also believes in supporting Israel against Hamas, and as foreign secretary has led the push in support for Ukraine. Tom Tugendhat Tugendhat has said he is a \u201cfan of what Donald Trump has done\u201d but has also refused to say if he would support his presidential campaign."

            "date": "2024-09-24T17:05:47Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden has sought to defend his foreign policy achievements on the world stage with an address to the United Nations general assembly against a backdrop of three brutal, intractable wars that have stymied world diplomats seeking an end to the bloodshed. Addressing the assembly hall in New York on Tuesday, Biden took on the mantle of elder statesman as he alternated between a message of hope and a full-throated defense of his record on foreign policy. Without giving a clear vision of how the wars in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan might end, he drew on his five decades in government service to exhort leaders to serve their people and find ways to make peace. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a remarkable sweep of history,\u201d he said. \u201cThings can get better, we should never forget that, I\u2019ve seen that throughout my career.\u201d Biden first turned his attention to Ukraine, where he once again condemned Vladimir Putin\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion and called for continued support for Kyiv. \u201cWe cannot grow weary,\u201d he said, as the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, looked on. \u201cWe cannot look away. We will not let up on our support for Ukraine. Not until Ukraine wins a just and durable peace.\u201d He also said that \u201cPutin\u2019s war has failed at his core aim,\u201d leading to a strategic reordering that strengthened Nato and brought two new countries, Finland and Sweden, into the security pact. Biden condemned Hamas for its 7 October attack on Israel but also expressed sympathy for the millions of people in Gaza who were \u201cgoing through hell\u201d amid the ongoing Israeli operation there. \u201cNow is the time for the parties to finalize the terms, bring the hostages home and secure security for Israel and Gaza free of Hamas\u2019s grip, ease the suffering in Gaza and end this war,\u201d he said to applause. Addressing the risk of a potential full-scale war in Lebanon, Biden said that a \u201cfull-scale war is not in anyone\u2019s interest\u201d and added that \u201ceven though the situation has escalated, a diplomatic solution is still possible.\u201d But the speech was more about emotions and atmosphere, a kind of diplomatic elegy, than it was a policy brief for a path forward. At one point, he paraphrased the Irish poet William Butler Yeats, who after the first world war wrote that \u201cthings fall apart; the centre cannot hold; mere anarchy is loosed upon the world\u201d. \u201cI see a critical distinction,\u201d he said. \u201cIn our time, the center has held.\u201d \u201cI know many look at the world today and see difficulties and react with despair, but I do not and I won\u2019t,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAs leaders we don\u2019t have the luxury.\u201d Biden\u2019s vision was delivered amid criticism at the UN and abroad. Shortly after the speech, Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, defended continued strikes in Lebanon, claiming that Israel was targeting Hezbollah arms storehouses and urging civilians to distance itself from the Shia militant group. Taking the stage at the UN after Biden, Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan accused America of continuing to arm Israel so it can continue its \u201cmassacre\u201d, while pretending to look for a ceasefire. He asked Washington, a fellow Nato member, \u201cHow long are you going to be able to carry the shame of witnessing this massacre?\u201d, adding that what had happened in Gaza was a great moral collapse. \u201cCountries that have a say over Israel are openly complicit in this massacre,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said. Biden is said to recognize that he is running out of time to broker a ceasefire in Gaza, which he sees as the main goal for his final months in office. On Monday, the New York Times reported that many members of Biden\u2019s national security team were exasperated with the Netanyahu. The report said that Biden had held \u201cshouting matches\u201d during phone calls with the prime minister, and that the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had held \u201cfrustrating\u201d visits to Jerusalem where he was given private assurances from Netanyahu, only to see him publicly contradict them hours later. US officials have described frenetic efforts to find a way to de-escalate the growing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, where a strike on Tuesday killed six and injured 15 in Dahieh in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. That attack came one day after a heavy Israeli bombardment killed nearly 500 people in the country\u2019s deadliest day of conflict since the war in 2006. Israeli officials have told reporters that they are seeking \u201cde-escalation through escalation\u201d, driving Hezbollah and its backer Iran to the negotiating table by demonstrating Tel Aviv\u2019s military superiority. But in remarks on the sidelines of the summit, US officials have voiced doubt that this policy could work, and said they are focused on \u201creducing tensions \u2026 and breaking the cycle of strike-counterstrike\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t recall, at least in recent memory, a period in which an escalation or intensification led to a fundamental de-escalation and led to profound stabilization of the situation,\u201d a senior state department official said in a briefing. The official did not say whether the administration believed Israel was planning to launch a ground invasion. \u201cWe obviously do not believe that a ground invasion of Lebanon is going to contribute to reducing tensions in the region,\u201d he said. At the same time, the official said, the US was constrained by diplomatic relations and protocol considerations with Hezbollah\u2019s main backer, Iran. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be talking to the Iranian government anytime soon,\u201d the official said. A portion of Biden\u2019s speech was dedicated to defending his foreign policy as president. In particular, he reaffirmed his decision to exit Afghanistan 20 years after a US invasion following the terror attacks on 9/11. The United States\u2019 chaotic withdrawal was marred by the Abbey Gate terrorist attack, where 13 US soldiers and more than 170 Afghan civilians were killed, and led to the Taliban\u2019s return to power just days later. But Biden said that he had fulfilled a key promise to end the US\u2019s longest war since Vietnam. \u201cIt was a hard decision but the right decision,\u201d Biden said. \u201cFour American presidents had to face that decision. But I was determined not to leave it to a fifth.\u201d Biden also addressed his \u201cdifficult decision\u201d not to seek another term in office but recast his own story as an exhortation against autocracy. \u201cAs much as I love the job, I love my country more,\u201d he said. \u201cI decided after 50 years of public service it\u2019s time for a new generation of leadership to take my nation forward. My fellow leaders, let us never forget some things are more important than staying in power.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-26T21:36:45Z",
            "content": "Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, has been charged with accepting bribes and illegal campaign contributions from foreign sources after an indictment was filed against the leader of one of the world\u2019s biggest cities. In a five-count criminal indictment, US prosecutors allege that before and during his terms as mayor, Adams \u201csought and accepted improper valuable benefits, such as luxury international travel, including from wealthy foreign businesspeople and at least one Turkish government official seeking to gain influence over him\u201d. The criminal counts against Adams include conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to receive campaign contributions by foreign nationals, wire fraud, and solicitation of a contribution by a foreign national. Adams\u2019s arraignment was scheduled for noon on Friday before magistrate judge Katharine Parker. The complaint focuses on trips Adams and his partner took to Turkey, India and Ghana on Turkish airlines, sometimes staying in luxury hotels, that as an elected official he should have disclosed to the government, and campaign contributions made by Turkish officials through a system of \u201cstraw\u201d donors. Adams \u201cdid not disclose the travel benefits he had obtained in annual financial disclosures he was required to file as a New York City employee\u201d, the government alleges. \u201cSometimes, Adams agreed to pay a nominal fee to create the appearance of having paid for travel that was in fact heavily discounted.\u201d Prosecutors allege that Adams \u201ccreated and instructed others to create fake paper trails, falsely suggesting that he had paid, or planned to pay, for travel benefits that were free\u201d. In September 2021, two months before he was elected New York mayor, prosecutors allege, Turkish officials called in their debt, telling Adams \u201cit was his turn to repay the Turkish official, by pressuring the New York City fire department (\u2018FDNY\u2019) to facilitate the opening of a new Turkish consular building \u2013 a 36-story skyscraper without a fire inspection \u2013 in time for a high-profile visit by Turkey\u2019s president\u201d. The indictment notes that at the time, the building close to the UN would have failed an FDNY inspection. \u201cIn exchange for free travel and other travel related bribes in 2021 and 2022 arranged by the Turkish official, Adams did as instructed,\u201d the indictment says. Shortly before prosecutors held a press conference to announce the charges, Adams held his own, surrounded by clergy and family as well as protesters calling for his resignation. Adams insisted he was innocent. \u201cI ask New Yorkers to wait to hear our defence,\u201d he said, and added: \u201cEveryone who knows me knows that I follow the campaign rules and I follow the law.\u201d But at the end of the press conference, Adams walked away to chants of \u201cResign! Resign! Resign!\u201d from some protesters. The US attorney Damian Williams said Adams had committed \u201ca grave breach of public trust\u201d by accepting more than $100,000 in luxury travel benefits without disclosing them, seeking illegal campaign contributions from Turkish officials as recently as last year and taking \u201ccorrupt official action\u201d over the approval of Turkey\u2019s consulate. The mayor, Williams said, crossed \u201cbright red lines\u201d again and again. \u201cPublic office is a privilege and we allege Mayor Adams abused that privilege and broke the law \u2013 laws that are designed to ensure that officials like him serve the people, not the highest bidder, not a foreign bidder and certainly not a foreign power,\u201d Williams added. \u201cThis investigation continues,\u201d he said, promising to hold more people accountable. If convicted, Adams could face five years for conspiracy, five years for seeking foreign campaign donations and 20 years for wire fraud. Prosecutors contend that by him concealing illegal contributions, his 2021 mayoral campaign received more than $10m in matching public funds. \u201cThese are very serious charges and if the facts are as the government says, it\u2019s going to be very hard for the mayor to prevail,\u201d said Columbia Law School\u2019s Richard Briffault. The US attorney also took steps to quell claims that the charges had been brought by the justice department because Adams opposed the Biden administration\u2019s southern border policy, which he has called a \u201cdisaster\u201d and claimed had flooded New York with immigrants. \u201cWe are not focused on the right and the left,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe are only focused on right and wrong.\u201d The moment is a deep crisis for the former police officer, who was elected with a tough-on-crime agenda but who has courted controversy throughout his political career and has been a polarising figure on the left. Adams is the first sitting New York City mayor to be criminally charged. Many local politicians in the city have called for his resignation, including the leftist Bronx Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is a powerful influence in the city and the national Democratic party. Ocasio-Cortez said that after the indictment news and the previous resignation of several city officials, including the police commissioner, \u201cI do not see how Mayor Adams can continue governing New York City. \u201cFor the good of the city, he should resign.\u201d When the news broke of the indictment late on Wednesday night, Adams released a defiant video statement. \u201cI always knew that if I stood my ground for New Yorkers that I would be a target \u2013 and a target I became,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIf I am charged, I am innocent and I will fight this with every ounce of my strength and spirit.\u201d He also vowed to stay in office. \u201cI have been facing these lies for months \u2026 yet the city has continued to improve,\u201d Adams said. \u201cMake no mistake. You elected me to lead this city and lead it I will.\u201d The indictment followed months of scrutiny after some of his closest aides and allies came under federal investigation as prosecutors began examining his inner circle. Less than a month ago, federal agents raided the homes of high-ranking officials within Adams\u2019s administration and seized electronic devices from the home of the New York police department commissioner."

            "date": "2024-09-25T17:01:22Z",
            "content": "Demonstrations are being held across Italy on Wednesday evening in protest against a new security bill described as \u201crepressive\u201d and \u201cdangerous for the country\u2019s democracy\u201d. The 24 laws contained in the bill, which passed its first hurdle in the lower house of parliament last week and now needs approval in the senate, is the latest attempt by Giorgia Meloni\u2019s far-right government to get tough on law and order. It comes down especially hard on climate activists and migrants. Under the laws, anyone who blocks roads or railways will face a jail term and fines of up to \u20ac300 (\u00a3250), while penalties will be more severe for those who protest against \u201cstrategic\u201d public works, such as the Italy-France high-speed rail project TAV, and a bridge connecting Sicily to mainland Italy. If passed, the laws will also give authorities and the police the power to enforce wider surveillance in prisons and pre-deportation migration detention centres, with rioting criminalised and \u201cpassive resistance\u201d to orders, including hunger strikes, carrying sentences of between one and five years. Another element of the bill envisages the criminalisation of businesses that sell sim cards to people who do not have ID documents and a residence permit. Cgil, Italy\u2019s largest and most powerful trade union, said the bill was \u201cdangerous for the country\u2019s democracy\u201d and has joined forces with a number of associations, including Anpi, the anti-fascist group, to organise protests against the bill\u2019s \u201cfreedom-killing idea of security\u201d. \u201cThe right wing continues to regard security only in terms of repression and punishment of social struggles,\u201d the associations said in a joint statement. \u201c[The government] is making penalties more harsh and introducing new crimes that will hit the most peaceful forms of protest and compress the spaces for democracy in our country.\u201d Opposition parties are also joining the demonstrations. The centre-left Democratic party said: \u201cThe security bill is an attack on individual and collective freedoms. It represses dissent and aims to create subjects instead of citizens.\u201d Angelo Bonelli, the leader of the Greens and Left Alliance, said the bill would \u201ctransform our country into a permanent police state\u201d. \u201cIf this authoritarian measure is approved by the senate, the government will be able to arrest and \u2018silence\u2019 workers who protest against losing their job, and any young activist who fights against social, environmental and ecological injustices,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re facing an authoritarian and freedom-killing drift that cannot leave us indifferent. Protesting is a civil duty.\u201d Valentina D\u2019Orso, a deputy with the Five Star Movement, accused the government of \u201cwriting a series of legal, ethical and civil aberrations. This includes the crime of revolt against orders issued, even in migrant centres and facilities housing unaccompanied foreign minors.\u201d Matteo Salvini, Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister, has asked for the bill\u2019s approval to be given \u201cutmost priority\u201d. He has long pushed for jail time and stiffer fines for climate activists amid a series of roadblock protests and activism targeting famous artworks, monuments and cultural sites. There have already been examples of alleged repression against climate activists. On 14 October, a Rome court will rule on whether to approve a request from the city\u2019s police headquarters to put Giacomo Baggio Zilio, a member of Ultima Generazione (Last Generation), under surveillance. The request came after Zilio\u2019s involvement in the group\u2019s nonviolent protests. The activist also alleges he was a victim of police aggression after a protest in May. \u201cA state begins to increase repression when it feels insecure,\u201d Zilio said in a statement issued by Ultima Generazione on Wednesday. \u201cIf the population can no longer criticise, then this is not a democratic situation. Here there is a government that does not listen, and this does not only concern us, it concerns the workers who strike and block the streets, it concerns the students.\u201d Ultima Generazione activists said they would bombard Rome\u2019s police headquarters with emails in response to the surveillance request, adding that the security bill would not stop their protests: \u201cUntil the government really listens to the reasons for the protests carried out by Giacomo and many other people and decides to seriously address the climate crisis and the devastation that it is already causing to our country, [to] the people who live there, there will always be those who peacefully, but with all the necessary anger and hope, will take to the streets to protest.\u201d A Climate Rights International report last week exposed the increasingly heavy-handed treatment of climate activists in wealthy democratic countries in the global north, including Australia, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK and the US. The report found the measures in these countries \u2013 such as lengthy prison sentences, preventive detention and harassment \u2013 were a violation of governments\u2019 legal responsibility to protect basic rights to freedom of expression, assembly, and association. The Italian government\u2019s security bill follows a crackdown on illegal raves and juvenile crime. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 October 2024. Under the proposed law, those who block roads or railways will face a fine of up to \u20ac300, not up to \u20ac300,000 as an earlier version said."

            "date": "2024-09-11T14:12:29Z",
            "content": "Manchester United are confident they comply with Premier League and Uefa financial rules despite posting a \u00a3113.2m net loss in their latest accounts. It is the fifth consecutive year United have made an annual loss, with the club \u00a3115.5m in the red in 2021-22 and \u00a342.1m in 2022-23. Profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) permit a \u00a3105m loss over a three-year period, but within the regulations certain deductions are allowed in relation to investment in infrastructure, the academy and women\u2019s teams, among other things, which United believe means they will not fall foul of spending regulations. Everton and Nottingham Forest received points deductions last season after exceeding permitted losses in regards to PSR. United achieved club-record revenues of \u00a3661.8m in the year ending 30 June and have engaged in a number of cost-cutting measures, which the club hierarchy hope will lead to savings between \u00a340m and \u00a345m a year. United announced plans in July to make 250 people redundant as part of restructuring under Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who bought a 25% stake in United in December and now heads football operations at Old Trafford. As part of the club\u2019s new structure under Ratcliffe, Omar Berrada moved from Manchester City to become the new chief executive. Part of Berrada\u2019s remit is to put United on safer financial ground by making them operate in a more efficient manner, while maximising football and commercial success. The huge increase in losses compared with last year can, in part, be attributed to overspending in the transfer market. Eight-figure fees were paid for Mason Mount, Andr\u00e9 Onana and Rasmus H\u00f8jlund but the investment \u2013 which contributed to a 10% increase in the wage bill, to \u00a3364.7m \u2013 failed to secure Champions League football last season as United finished eighth. This will have a knock-on effect in next year\u2019s accounts, with United\u2019s broadcast revenue expected to drop by \u00a330m due to them being in the Europa League rather than the Champions League. There was a one-off cost of \u00a347.8m relating to a strategic review, which ultimately led to Ratcliffe buying into the club and overseeing management changes that included Dan Ashworth and Jason Wilcox being appointed to senior roles. Ratcliffe has committed to injecting $300m (\u00a3229m) into United by the end of the calendar year, having already paid two-thirds of that amount. Work has begun on \u00a350m redevelopment plans at the Carrington training ground. \u201cThe club remains committed to, and in compliance with, both the Premier League\u2019s profit and sustainability rules and Uefa\u2019s financial fair play regulations,\u201d said Berrada. \u201cWe are working towards greater financial sustainability and making changes to our operations to make them more efficient, to ensure we are directing our resources to enhancing on-pitch performance. \u201cUltimately, the strength of Manchester United is driven by the passion and loyalty of our supporters. Our clear objective is to return the club to the top of European football. Everyone at the club is aligned on a clear strategy to deliver sustained success both on and off the pitch, for the ultimate benefit of our fans, shareholders, and hugely diverse range of stakeholders.\u201d Ronaldo makes new attack on Ten Hag Cristiano Ronaldo has launched a fresh attack on the Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag. Speaking on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, he said: \u201cThe coach says they cannot compete to win the league and Champions League. As Manchester United coach, you cannot say that you\u2019re not going to fight to win the league or Champions League.\u201d Ronaldo left Manchester United in November 2022 and claimed he felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d, saying of Ten Hag: \u201cI don\u2019t have respect for him because he doesn\u2019t show respect for me.\u201d Reflecting on his departure, Ronaldo told Ferdinand: \u201cI\u2019m not happy the way it all happened \u2026 but it\u2019s done, already done. I love that club. I\u2019m not that kind of guy that forgot the past.\u201d \u201cThis club needs time to rebuild because it\u2019s still one of the best clubs in the world, but they need to change,\u201d Ronaldo said. \u201cI believe that the future will be bright \u2026 [but] they have to rebuild from the bottom. If not, they cannot compete. It will be impossible. \u201cThey can do good things, yes, they can win Carabao [Cup] \u2026 but Champions League or Europa League or Premier League [will be] difficult, in my opinion,\u201d the 39-year-old added. \u201cI wish that I\u2019m wrong, but [it] will be difficult.\u201d PA Media"

            "content": "The City minister has asked the financial watchdog to rethink plans to \u201cname and shame\u201d some firms it investigates, suggesting she could overrule them. Speaking at the fringes of the Labour party conference on Tuesday, Tulip Siddiq said she has held several meetings with the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, to question it about its plans before determining if she will allow them to proceed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was great in the way that it was done. I\u2019ll see what they report back at the next meeting and make a decision,\u201d she said. Her remarks come after lobbying groups, including UK Finance, suggested the naming and shaming approach could be \u201charmful to wider financial stability\u201d. Siddiq\u2019s position is similar to that of former chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who was criticised for pushing back against the FCA\u2019s plans, due to its supposed independence from government. The FCA has said its plans would only involve naming firms where there was a clear public interest to do so. Speaking at a conference hosted by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) in London on Tuesday, the FCA\u2019s joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight said the regulator understood the City\u2019s concerns. \u201cI want to reassure everyone \u2026 that we have heard the strength of feeling on this \u2013 from all sides \u2013 and that this is very much an ongoing conversation,\u201d Therese Chambers said. \u201cSince the consultation closed in April, we have been reflecting on the range of serious concerns raised and working to build understanding. We do think the case for a degree more transparency remains strong. But it needs to be seen within the vital context of a focused number of cases likely to deliver the greatest deterrent, and delivered much faster.\u201d She said the FCA will \u201cintensify our engagement\u201d with the City, and meet with \u201ctrade associations, firms, those on all sides of the debate\u201d to help develop its plans. It will then follow up with case studies and \u201cgreater detail on how it could work in practice\u201d. \u201cWe are committed to achieving this in the right way for UK consumers and markets, so we won\u2019t be rushing into any decisions.\u201d Siddiq also singled out fintech company Revolut \u2013 with whose UK chief executive, Francesca Carlesi, she appeared on stage \u2013 for their research on economic crime, saying it was \u201cforming some of the script\u201d for her on the topic. Her remarks come after the company received a UK banking licence in July. The process took three years, far longer than the business had initially suggested. This summer, the Financial Ombudsman Service revealed that Revolut topped the list for new fraud and scam complaints. The company has been on a recruitment drive to beef up its compliance teams. When asked, Carlesi said there was \u201cno trade off\u201d with growth and that compliance was critical for the company\u2019s growth plans. \u201cWe employ almost 4,000 people in compliance and the company has invested a lot,\u201d she said. The FCA reportedly investigated the business in 2016 after a whistleblower claimed it was failing to conduct adequate money-laundering checks or properly flag suspect payments. The investigation was closed in 2017."

Addressing the UN security council, of which Russia is one of five permanent members, Starmer delivered a direct message to Moscow that it should not be present at the meeting. He accused Russia of violating the UN charter because its invasion of Ukraine was illegal, threatened global security and had caused \u201ccolossal human suffering\u201d. \u201cWe must ensure accountability for those violating the UN charter and this council must recommit to the values that it sets out,\u201d he said. \u201cThis should go without saying. Yet, the greatest violation of the charter in a generation has been committed by one of this council\u2019s permanent members.\u201d He drew attention to the 35,000 civilians who have been killed or injured, the 6 million forced to flee and almost 20,000 Ukrainian children kidnapped by Russia. The British prime minister added: \u201cI think of Yaroslav Bazylevych, whose wife and three daughters were killed earlier this month by a Russian strike on civilians in Lviv. And I wonder how Russia can show its face in this building. \u201cSix hundred thousand Russian soldiers have also been killed or wounded in this war. And for what? The UN charter, which they sit here to uphold, speaks of human dignity. Not treating your own citizens as bits of meat to fling into the grinder.\u201d As well as calling for accountability for Russia, Starmer also addressed the conflicts in the Middle East, saying the region was \u201con the brink\u201d. He called for diplomacy and an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, and an immediate, full and complete ceasefire in relation to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza with the release of all the hostages. \u201cWe need a political route to that agreement, which provides a bridge to a better future. A credible and irreversible path towards a viable Palestinian state,\u201d he said. \u201cAlongside a safe and secure state of Israel. This is the only way to provide security and justice for both Israelis and Palestinians.\u201d Starmer\u2019s trip to the United Nations general assembly in New York is his third trip to the US in three months. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is also attending to present his \u201cvictory plan\u201d to Joe Biden and the US presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Zelenskyy has been seeking permission to use British-French made Storm Shadow missiles on Russian territory, with UK support, but negotiations with the US are still continuing as the weapons use some US technology. Pressed on when a decision would be made about the use of UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles within Russia, Starmer said: \u201cWe will have discussions about a whole range of issues, and we will listen carefully to what President Zelenskyy\u2019s got to say, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen in the next few days.\u201d He added the discussions would not be about the \u201csole issue like long-range missiles\u201d but a \u201cstrategic, overarching route for Ukraine to find a way through this and succeed against Russian aggression\u201d. Addressing the UN security council on Tuesday, Zelenskyy accused Moscow of committing \u201cinternational crimes\u201d by targeting Ukrainian civilians and energy infrastructure, and claimed he had proof that Putin was plotting to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants to further degrade the country\u2019s energy grid."

            "content": "The appointment of a former police chief to head the new border security command shows ministers are making serious attempts to stop unofficial Channel crossings rather than the \u201cgimmicks\u201d of the last government, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has said. Ahead of talks centred on migration between Keir Starmer and the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, in Rome, Cooper said such international cooperation was the only way to make progress \u2013 but declined to say when the pace of arrivals might drop. Challenged over criticism from rights groups and some Labour MPs to distance the government from Meloni\u2019s hard-right administration, Cooper said it was very common for the UK to work with governments of other political leanings. On Sunday night, Martin Hewitt, the former chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, who oversaw the UK\u2019s enforcement of lockdown laws during the Covid pandemic, was named as the commander of the border security command. Cooper told BBC One\u2019s Breakfast that the appointment demonstrated the serious approach Labour was taking, contrasting this to the last government\u2019s Rwanda scheme. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take practical steps,\u201d Cooper said, speaking a day after eight people died while trying to cross the Channel in a small boat in the early hours of Sunday morning. \u201cWe know that this has all been driven by what\u2019s become a criminal industry, effectively running along our borders,\u201d she argued. \u201cThere really hasn\u2019t been serious, coordinated law enforcement involving countries right across Europe, all the way along in which the boats are being brought in, the way in which the engines are being put together, coordinating right along the way that the criminal gangs operate. That\u2019s not been done before.\u201d Asked how soon there would be a reduction in small boat crossings, Cooper said only that the aim was to \u201cgo as fast as we possibly can, because nobody should be making these dangerous boat crossings\u201d. She said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do this through headlines. We\u2019re going to do it through hard work. We\u2019re not going to just do it through gimmicks.\u201d The prime minister will head to Rome on Monday to examine how Meloni\u2019s government has cut the number of people arriving in small boats across the Mediterranean by almost two-thirds in the past year, from 118,000 to 44,500. Meloni has focused on financial deals with north African countries such as Tunisia and Libya to improve border security and stop the boats leaving in the first place. This autumn she will go further by opening a holding centre in Albania, where asylum seekers picked up at sea by Italian rescue ships will be taken while their asylum applications are processed. The Refugee Council and Amnesty International have called on Starmer to avoid any more \u201cgimmicks\u201d, while one backbencher questioned why a Labour administration was \u201cseeking to learn lessons from a neo-fascist government\u201d. Asked about this, Cooper said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a history of working with governments that have different political parties, that are not aligned.

            "date": "2024-09-15T08:00:52Z",
            "content": "On former railway sidings at Grimsby docks in Lincolnshire, the seafood industry is backing new plans for an onshore salmon farm that it claims will create jobs, cut emissions and help meet the nation\u2019s huge demand for the fish. The scheme would be the UK\u2019s first large-scale onshore salmon farm, with the fish growing to a weight of four or five kilograms. The project\u2019s backer says the closed system would prevent disease and invasions of sea lice, which can blight open-net salmon farms. But the project is now at the centre of a legal battle between North East Lincolnshire council, which approved the scheme in November last year, and animal rights campaigners, who claim it is a \u201cnew form of factory farming\u201d. The animal welfare charity Animal Equality UK has successfully sought permission for a judicial review over the scheme, which is supposed to produce about 5,000 tonnes of fish a year. Abigail Penny, the charity\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cTo accommodate the extremely tight profit margins for a project of this nature, the fish must be crammed into crowded tanks and kept in artificial environments throughout their entire lives. Many similar farms have suffered mass mortality events, with thousands of fish dying due to failing equipment.\u201d Councillors who approved the scheme last year were told that concerns about fish welfare should be noted, but \u201care not considered to be material land use planning considerations\u201d. Animal Equality UK was granted permission for judicial review on 5 September after it argued animal welfare could be considered during the planning process and the councillors were misdirected by officials. UK consumers spend more than \u00a31.2bn a year on salmon in supermarkets and large retailers, making it the nation\u2019s most popular fish. Farmed salmon is one of the UK\u2019s biggest exports, but the operators of open-net salmon farms have been accused of having a \u201ccatastrophic impact\u201d on fish welfare and the environment. Charities and conservation groups in January called for organic certification to be removed from open-net salmon and trout farms, because of the \u201cnegative environmental impacts\u201d. The Scottish salmon industry says its farmers meet the highest international standards and are committed to protecting the marine environment. The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, a government agency, has highlighted the potential role of indoor tank systems, known as recirculating aquaculture systems. It says these \u201cclosed-loop systems\u201d minimise the risks associated with conventional fish farming such as pollution, parasites and escapees. An English aquaculture strategy published in November 2020 said there was growing investor interest in the land-based production of Atlantic salmon close to large English cities. The proposed new \u00a3120m farm on the eastern outskirts of Grimsby docks is backed by the company AquaCultured Seafood. The business says the facility would \u201coptimise\u201d fish welfare and prevent disease or sea lice from entering the system. The scheme is supported by the Seafood Grimsby and Humber Alliance as a \u201cstepping stone\u2019 to UK food security. A submission to the planning committee by Mark Borthwick, a doctoral fellow in salmon farming, warned the farm would require high stocking densities. He said salmon ranged widely with a strong migration drive and it was unknown how they would cope in the cramped conditions of an onshore farm. His submission stated: \u201cThe industry\u2019s hope is that by doing the whole operation under factory conditions, they can control disease. However, as has been abundantly established in other farming environments, there is no truly biosecure factory farm and other diseases will emerge.\u201d Edie Bowles, solicitor at Advocates for Animals, the legal firm representing Animal Equality UK in the case against the council, said: \u201cI am delighted with the [judicial review] application being granted permission. It will hopefully be a wake-up call to other planning authorities that they need to follow the correct process.\u201cThis case is all about proper scrutiny being given for planning decisions that pose huge risks, including to animal welfare.\u201d The council said it would not comment while legal proceedings were continuing. AquaCultured Seafood has been approached for comment."

            "content": "EasyJet\u2019s brand owner has lost a trademark dispute against a fundraising website that has \u201ceasy\u201d in its name. EasyGroup took legal action against Easyfundraising, its founder, Ian Woodroffe OBE, and investors the Support Group (UK), after claiming it had infringed several trademarks. However, the defendants claimed there was no evidence to suggest a customer would confuse the two brands. In a high court ruling on Wednesday, Mr Justice Fancourt dismissed easyGroup\u2019s claims, saying \u201cit is unlikely that any but a few would make the association and be confused\u201d between the two brands. He added: \u201cUsers of Easyfundraising\u2019s advertising services would be least likely to be confused, as they were relatively sophisticated and careful business persons, or professionals, and as such are most unlikely to consider that Easyfundraising or Easysearch is an \u2018easy+\u2019 brand or connected in some way with easyGroup.\u201d EasyGroup was set up in 1998 by the Greek Cypriot entrepreneur Stelios Haji-Ioannou, and as of May 2024 listed more than 200 easy+-branded business ventures and websites within its portfolio, including easyJet, easyBus and easyHotel. EasyGroup claimed that in 2005 these trademarks were infringed when Easyfundraising was launched, and that the trademark was again infringed in 2007 by Easyfundraising\u2019s creation of the easysearch brand. EasyGroup also alleged the shopping website\u2019s \u201cpoor reputation\u201d would have a negative impact on the easy+ brand. However, Fancourt determined in an 81-page ruling that as \u201cthere is no identity or similarity of services provided by Easyfundraising and the services specified, the claimant\u2019s claim of infringement as at 2005 and 2007 must fail\u201d. Fancourt noted: \u201c[The] large number of retailers that advertise with Easyfundraising and have done so for years, including well-known and reputable high street brands such as Marks &amp; Spencer and John Lewis, demonstrate that retailers do not share the claimant\u2019s view that Easyfundraising has a poor reputation.\u201d He added: \u201cIndeed, many of the easyGroup licensees, including easyJet itself, advertised on Easyfundraising between 2010 and 2022, generating about \u00a31.25m of sales.\u201d \u2022 The headline and text of this article were amended on 12 September 2024. An earlier version described easyGroup as \u201cthe parent company of easyJet\u201d. This is not the case, though easyGroup is the owner of the airline\u2019s brand name. Also an earlier version said that \u201cEasyfundraising\u201d was a \u201ccharity shopping website\u201d; to clarify Easyfundraising is a company, not a charity."

            "content": "On 18 September, a partial lunar eclipse will occur. Nowhere near as dramatic as a total eclipse of the sun, it can still be a fascinating sight. Lunar eclipses are caused by the Earth passing between the sun and the moon. This casts the Earth\u2019s shadow on to the moon\u2019s surface. This week, the shadow does not entirely cover the moon, hence it is called a partial eclipse not a total one. Even for a partial eclipse, this particular one is modest. At the moment of greatest eclipse, the darkest part of Earth\u2019s shadow will cover only 3.5% of the moon\u2019s visible hemisphere. Nonetheless, it is fascinating to watch for the moment the shadow begins to bite into the moon and creep across its surface. The eclipse will be visible across Europe, Africa, Greenland and North and South America, but you\u2019ll need to set your alarm clock for this one. From London, the noticeable part of the eclipse (known as the umbral phase) will begin at 03:13 BST; maximum eclipse will take place at 03:44 BST; and the event will be over at 04:15 BST. As with most celestial observations involving the moon, no equipment is needed: just your eyes and, in this case, a strong morning cup of coffee."

            "date": "2024-09-23T15:00:02Z",
            "content": "Scientists, as well as Hollywood movie producers, have long looked to nuclear bombs as a promising form of defence should a massive asteroid appear without warning on a collision course with Earth. Now, researchers at a US government facility have put the idea on a firm footing, showing how such a blast might save the world in the first comprehensive demo of nuclear-assisted planetary defence. Physicists at Sandia National Laboratories, whose primary mission is to ensure the safety and security of the US nuclear arsenal, recorded in nanosecond detail how an immense pulse of radiation unleashed by a nuclear blast could vaporise the side of a nearby asteroid. The event is so violent that it heats the surface to tens of thousands of degrees, producing a rapidly expanding ball of gas capable of nudging the asteroid off course. Do the sums correctly and the shunt should be sufficient to put doomsday on hold. \u201cThe vaporised material shoots off one side, pushing the asteroid in the opposite direction,\u201d said Dr Nathan Moore, the first author on the study. \u201cIt\u2019s like turning the asteroid into its own rocket.\u201d Devastating asteroid impacts are rare in Earth\u2019s history, but humans have learned the lesson from 66m years ago that space rocks can spell catastrophe. The asteroid that ended the reign of the dinosaurs was about 6 miles wide, but far smaller rocks are still dangerous. The 60-foot-wide meteor that exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in 2013 injured more than 1,200 people. Given the existential nature of the threat, researchers are exploring strategies to shield Earth from massive impacts. In 2022, Nasa\u2019s Dart probe intentionally slammed into Dimorphos, a moonlet of an asteroid called Didymos. The mission showed that a kinetic impact could protect Earth, but the nudge needed to be given years before impending impact. The nuclear option is for larger asteroids, particularly when time is short. It does not involve shooting asteroids down, or taking Bruce Willis\u2019s approach in the movie Armageddon of dropping a bomb down a drill hole. More effective is a standoff explosion, which vaporises part of the asteroid\u2019s surface and leaves the rest to Newton\u2019s third law of motion. To test the idea, Moore and his colleagues constructed an unprecedented experiment that exposed pieces of mock asteroid to intense X-ray pulses similar to those released in nuclear blasts. The pulse first obliterates supports that hold the material in place and then swiftly vaporises the target surface, creating an expanding gas that sends it flying. Writing in Nature Physics, the researchers describe how the mock asteroids were subject to gravity as soon as the supports were destroyed, but that they fell less than 2 millionths of a millimetre before the 20 microsecond experiment was over. The bits of mock asteroid were propelled to nearly 200mph. The strategy should work for asteroids up to 2.5 miles wide, the scientists say, but that is not a hard upper limit. \u201cIf there is enough warning time, one can certainly deflect larger asteroids,\u201d Moore said. Prof Colin Snodgrass on the Dart mission science team at Edinburgh University said it was important to understand how to scale the results to full-size asteroids. The European Space Agency\u2019s Hera mission, due to launch next month, should help by surveying the aftermath of Dart\u2019s impact on Dimorphos. Prof Gareth Collins, a planetary scientist at Imperial College, called Moore\u2019s experiments \u201cspectacular\u201d. \u201cI still have a strong preference for non-nuclear options, particularly single or multiple kinetic impactors, as we know they are technologically achievable,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for a very large asteroid or a short warning time this type of approach may be our only option.\u201d"

            "content": "Whatever lingering mystery that surrounded the Weeknd\u2019s globally streamed one-night-only concert on Saturday night was put to rest a few hours before showtime, when representatives officially presented the pre-order details of his upcoming album Hurry Up Tomorrow. What came soon after was a riveting infomercial from the Canadian R&amp;B-pop singer and mystique merchant \u2013 real name Abel Tesfaye \u2013 that held the more than 70,000 fans that packed into the 64-year-old home of S\u00e3o Paulo FC in his thrall and served as a proof of concept for the tour that\u2019s surely to follow. The 34-year-old Toronto native managed to cram 27 songs into an hour-and-a-half-long set that featured a least a half-dozen new cuts, not confirmed but almost certainly from the upcoming record, roaming the huge stage that spanned the length of the pitch and clad in a black robe with gold trim, like a boxer making the lonely walk to the squared circle. While the official track list has yet to be revealed \u2013 much less the release date \u2013 the working titles of Dancing in the Flames and Run Away built off the moody vibes of 2020\u2019s After Hours and 2022\u2019s Dawn FM while showcasing his impressive vocals, stamina and musical versatility. Another crowd-pleasing debut track, S\u00e3o Paulo, took in a pair of songs by the funk singer Tati Quebra Barraco (Abre as Pernas, Mete a L\u00edngua and Kabo Kaki) and featured a surprise appearance by Brazilian pop megastar Anitta, who had taken the stage disguised as a backup dancer, that prompted deafening roars from the capacity audience. Same for Atlanta rapper Playboi Carti, who came on for a pair of covers: Travis Scott\u2019s FE!N and his own Timeless, an unreleased track that is expected to be included on his own forthcoming LP. Whether it\u2019s the idiosyncratic light-tenor range or liberal use of falsetto, songs such as Out of Time are the closest thing to Michael Jackson since the man himself and wouldn\u2019t feel out of place on Off the Wall. That\u2019s easier said than done; many have tried! Not surprisingly the most cathartic moments were reserved for a 15-minute screamer of set-closing bangers: the melodic synthpop virtuosity of Save Your Tears; the wildly catchy neon-hued climbing synths of Less Than Zero; the delicious Tony Scott/80s vibes of Blinding Lights, teased to perfection with an extended intro that toyed with the moment and transformed the room into a fist-pumping mass of humanity. That it gave way to an obscure cover \u2013 the Peter Ivers-David Lynch collab In Heaven (Lady in the Radiator Song) from the 1977 film Eraserhead \u2013 offered a worthy hat-tip to Tesfaye\u2019s off-kilter origins. Amid the final strains, a fleet of 150 drones appeared in the sky, spelling out the name of the new record, which publicity materials say \u201crepresents the creative apex\u201d of a triptych that started with After Hours and Dawn FM. Reported glitches on the global YouTube stream did appear to spill over minor wobbles in the in-house production. And the performer himself at times came off somewhat anxious, mixing in a couple of lyrical flubs. But those minor wobbles were almost entirely cancelled out by the sense of occasion and sheer scale of the spectacle. For a show that was essentially performed in the round, the sound mix was almost impossibly good. For his all-conquering popularity and steady creative output, there are some who believe the Weeknd, simultaneously mysterious and transparent, has not managed to put out anything as genuinely fascinating as the mixtape trilogy that put him on the map over a decade ago, not long after he was releasing music gratis on Soundcloud. An imperial era that has included a laundry list of streaming records and headlining the Super Bowl half-time show did little to quell those concerns. But wherever you fall on his latter-day transition from alternative R&amp;B to a perilously broad pop sound, this was a fully committed performer giving his all and intent on pushing the boundaries of the live stage show, setting the target high and hitting it almost perfectly."

            "date": "2024-09-30T15:00:04Z",
            "content": "Climbing Mount Everest has always been a feat, but it seems the task might be getting harder: researchers say Everest is having something of a growth spurt. The Himalayas formed about 50m years ago, when the Indian subcontinent smashed into the Eurasian tectonic plate \u2013 although recent research has suggested the edges of these plates were already very high before the collision. With the process still going on, the mountain range continues to be pushed upwards, though landslides and other events mean rock is also being lost. But now experts say Everest \u2013 which currently stands at 8,849m (29,032ft) \u2013 has been experiencing an additional boost to its height as a result of erosion by its neighbouring rivers. The team say the process has resulted in Everest rising an extra 15 to 50 metres over the last 89,000 years, with the uplift continuing today. \u201cOur study demonstrates that even the world\u2019s highest peak is subject to ongoing geological processes that can measurably affect its height over relatively short geological timescales,\u201d said Prof Jingen Dai, co-author of the study from China University of Geosciences in Beijing. Dai noted Everest is something of an anomaly, with its peak about 250 metres higher than the Himalayas\u2019 other tallest mountains. In addition, data has suggested a discrepancy between Everest\u2019s long-term and short-term rates of uplift. \u201cThis raised the question of whether there was an underlying mechanism making Everest\u2019s anomalous elevation even higher,\u201d said Dai. Writing in the journal Nature Geoscience, Dai and colleagues report how they created computer models to explore the evolution of river networks in the Himalayas. Their results suggest that about 89,000 years ago the upper reach of the Arun River that lies to the north of Everest \u2013 and which would have flowed eastward on the Tibetan plateau \u2013 merged with its lower reach, as a result of the latter eroding northward. The upshot was that the entire length of the Arun River became part of the Kosi River system. The team suggest the rerouting arising from this \u201criver capture\u201d resulted in an increase in river erosion near Everest, and the formation of the Arun River gorge. \u201cAt that time, there would be an enormous amount of additional water flowing through the Arun River, and this would have been able to transport more sediment and erode more bedrock, and cut down into the valley bottom,\u201d said Dr Matthew Fox, co-author of the research, from University College London. The researchers say the reduction in weight on the Earth\u2019s crust as this material was removed has led to an uplift of the surrounding land \u2013 a process known as isostatic rebound. The team estimates the process is propelling Everest upwards by about 0.16mm to 0.53mm a year, with its neighbouring peaks Lhotse and Makalu, the world\u2019s fourth and fifth highest peaks respectively, experiencing a similar uplift. \u201cThis effect will not continue indefinitely,\u201d said Dai. \u201cThe process will continue until the river system reaches a new equilibrium state.\u201d Prof Mika\u00ebl Attal of the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the work, said while river capture was a well-known phenomenon, it was relatively rare. \u201cWhat is unique in this study is the demonstration that erosion resulting from river capture can lead to such a dramatic response of the Earth\u2019s surface, with an area the size of Greater London going up a few tens of metres in tens of thousands of years, which is fast,\u201d he said. However, Attal notes this rebound only explains a fraction of the unusual height of the highest peaks of the Himalayas. Indeed, Fox noted other mechanisms such as tectonic stresses associated with earthquake cycles, and loss of mountain glaciers, could also cause uplift. Dr Elizabeth Dingle of Durham University said the study\u2019s findings could be important beyond Everest. \u201cThere are other river captures known to have occurred in the Himalaya,\u201d she said, \u201cSo it would be interesting to know whether similar effects are preserved elsewhere, or in other tectonically active mountain ranges more broadly.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-30T07:32:23Z",
            "content": "UK house prices are growing at their fastest annual rate for nearly two years as borrowing costs continue to fall on expectations that the Bank of England will keep cutting interest rates, Nationwide has said. The building society said prices grew by 3.2% in September compared with the same month last year, well above the 2.4% annual growth recorded in August, and the fastest pace since the 4.4% recorded in November 2022. The average house price across the UK was \u00a3266,094 in September \u2013 a 0.7% month-on-month increase on August and only 2% below the all-time high prices recorded in the summer of 2022. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cIncome growth has continued to outstrip house price growth in recent months while borrowing costs have edged lower amid expectations that the Bank of England will continue to lower interest rates in the coming quarters. \u201cThese trends have helped to improve affordability for prospective buyers and underpinned a modest increase in activity and house prices, though both remain subdued by historic standards.\u201d Separate figures from the Bank showed a rise in monthly mortgage approvals to 64,900 in August from 62,500 in July, reflecting an uptick in housing market activity as borrowing costs fall and real wage growth remains resilient. Net mortgage lending rose to \u00a32.9bn, up by about \u00a3100m compared with the previous month. Borrowing on consumer credit increased from \u00a31.2bn to \u00a31.3bn, in a development that economists said reflected strength in household finances. \u201c[This] remains consistent with our view that consumer spending growth will strengthen over the coming quarters,\u201d said Ashley Webb, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. The Office for National Statistics said the household saving ratio \u2013 a measure of the proportion of disposable income that is not spent on consumption \u2013 rose to 10% in the second quarter, up from 8.9% in the first three months of the year. However, it warned that the UK economy grew by less than it previously estimated between April and June. Gross domestic product increased by 0.5%, down from an initial estimate of 0.6%, after output in manufacturing and construction fell by more than first thought. Mortgage lenders have been dropping their rates on new product deals in recent months on the prospect of further cuts to the cost of borrowing after the Bank of England reduced its base rate from 5.25% to 5% in August, its first cut since March 2020. Despite holding rates unchanged at its most recent policy meeting earlier this month, the Bank signalled borrowing costs were \u201cnow gradually on the path down\u201d from the highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis. Lenders such as Nationwide, Halifax and HSBC are now offering five-year fixed rates at below 4% for buyers for the first time since the start of the year. Banks have also started lending more to borrowers in the last month, with Nationwide announcing last week it would start to offer first-time buyers loans at six times their annual household income. Lloyds and Halifax have recently upped their borrowing limits to 5.5 times household incomes. The Nationwide figures, which also recorded performance over the third quarter of the year, showed that the increase in house prices in the north of England over that period outpaces those in the south. The average house price across the three months to September 2024 grew by 3.1% in the north of England year-on-year, compared with 1.3% in the south. Northern Ireland recorded the biggest increase across the period, with an 8.6% growth in house prices, while Scotland experienced a 4.3% increase. Wales recorded a 2.5% rise. Terrace houses continued to show the biggest annual increases in prices, with the average cost up by 3.5% in September. The average price for a flat increased by 2.7%."

            "content": "Gym-goers who want to pump the heaviest weights might figure that bulging thighs and bulky buttocks are the path to greater power. But a study involving one of the world\u2019s strongest men found that a set of slender, rope-like muscles that typically get far less attention could be more important than previously thought. Scientists at Loughborough University\u2019s school of sport, exercise and health sciences examined the rippling sinews of Eddie Hall, a Staffordshire truck mechanic nicknamed \u201cthe Beast\u201d who became the world\u2019s strongest man in 2017. They discovered that after his 15 years of continuous training, a set of long, thin muscles in his legs were up to three times the size of those in men who do no strength training. To their surprise, they found that these muscles in Hall \u2013 linking from below the knee up to the pelvis \u2013 showed the greatest development compared with mere mortals who do not spend any time developing extreme strength. They are known as \u201cguy rope\u201d muscles and they stabilise the pelvis and thigh bone. The scientific name of these less understood powerhouses are the sartorius, gracilis and semitendinosus, and they helped Hall achieve a world record 500kg deadlift in 2020 \u2013 equivalent to lifting a camel from the floor. Relative to untrained men, these muscles demonstrated the largest differences in mass of any that were examined in laboratory conditions. Some of his other muscles and tendons \u2013 for example, the patella tendon in the knee and the hip flexors \u2013 were far less out of the ordinary. \u201cThese muscles have had very little attention scientifically, so we don\u2019t really know how important they are in different tasks,\u201d said Jonathan Folland, a professor of neuromuscular performance. \u201cBut to find that they were really very well developed in someone who has spent decades lifting and carrying heavy loads \u2013 and is very good at that \u2013 was really interesting. These muscles clearly are more important for lifting and carrying very heavy loads than we previously thought.\u201d Dr Tom Balshaw, a lecturer in kinesiology, strength and conditioning at Loughborough, said it may be possible that targeted exercises, including hip rotations and knee flexing, could boost the \u201cguy rope\u201d muscles independently of squats and other, more common exercises that also appear to work. Hall has bench-pressed 300kg and achieved a world record 216kg on the axle press, which requires a huge barbell to be lifted from the ground and held above the head. After that milestone, a pumped Hall declared: \u201cDon\u2019t ever, ever put a limit on what I can do, because I will prove you wrong every single time.\u201d Hall is available to hire for events and will appear in a 1960s British army tank painted with his \u201cBeast\u201d logo for \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,000 a time. The study comes amid a boom in gym use among young men and women. It has sparked concerns about the effect of \u201cgymfluencers\u201d and fears that constant comparison with ideal bodies could can cause mental health problems. A report by PureGym said 42% of 16-24-year-olds increased their spending on exercise last year. Just how different Hall is from the general population was made clear when the scientists at Loughborough measured his individual muscles. The quadriceps in his thighs were more than double the size of those of an untrained man and 18% larger than the next biggest the team had ever assessed, in an elite sprinter. Hall\u2019s hamstrings were twice the size of the untrained population\u2019s and his biceps femoris, a large muscle in the back of the thigh, was two to three times larger. In June, two slender TikTok influencers, Jamil and Jamel Neffati, had a closeup view of Hall\u2019s extreme dimensions after they signed up to fight him simultaneously at a mixed martial art event in Blackburn called the \u201cWorld Freak Fight League\u201d. Since the Neffatis each weighed less than half as much as Hall, his victory was never in doubt. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 September 2024. An earlier version said that Eddie Hall\u2019s 500kg deadlift was \u201cequivalent to hoisting a camel over his head\u201d. In fact a deadlift is picking up a weight from the ground to hip level, rather than over your head."

            "content": "Rachel Reeves is pushing for the UK\u2019s tax and spending watchdog to upgrade its national growth forecasts to reflect the economic boost Labour says can be achieved from its blitz of planning reforms. In a development that could open up additional spending headroom for the chancellor before next month\u2019s budget, the Treasury has held talks with the Office for Budget Responsibility to try to persuade its officials that unblocking the planning system could drive up growth. Labour has placed the liberalisation of the planning regime in England and Wales at the centre of its efforts to kickstart Britain\u2019s economy, with proposals to build millions of new homes and infrastructure projects. However, the OBR has previously dismissed such changes when drawing up its economic forecasts \u2013 including in 2011, when it judged there was insufficient evidence that David Cameron\u2019s pledge to bulldoze planning regulations would increase growth. Sources close to the Treasury said the significance of its drive to change the independent economic forecaster\u2019s perspective was because the OBR would most probably raise its expectations for tax revenue in tandem, reflecting the proceeds of a faster-growing economy. This could open up extra spending firepower, or help the chancellor to meet self-imposed fiscal rules without the need for raising taxes. Successive chancellors have taken this approach, aiming to win the maximum credit for their policies. Reeves revealed the details of her ambition at a fringe event at Labour\u2019s annual conference in Liverpool on Tuesday, saying she was keen on \u201cgetting the OBR to score the impact of the planning reforms\u201d before the 30 October budget. Speaking at the event hosted by the IPPR thinktank, she said: \u201cWe want to work with the OBR on providing the evidence to show that the planning reforms can also deliver growth.\u201d However, she also alluded to the challenges she would face. \u201cIn the last few years, obviously I\u2019ve followed as shadow chancellor what the OBR scores and doesn\u2019t score. They have scored the childcare changes under the previous government, and they\u2019ve scored immigration,\u201d she said. After her predecessor as chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, announced a multibillion-pound expansion in childcare support in last year\u2019s budget, the OBR upgraded its forecasts in anticipation that the policy would increase employment by 110,000 and increase GDP by 0.2% in five years. However, proving the benefits of planning reforms could be more difficult, after limited progress made in the past decade to increase housebuilding and construction of big projects despite the promises made by successive governments. The details come after Reeves was handed the OBR\u2019s first round of pre-budget forecasts on Thursday last week, providing her with the guide rails for her tax and spending decisions in next month\u2019s set-piece speech to the House of Commons. Days later, the chancellor hinted in her Liverpool conference speech that the 30 October budget would include a relaxation of the government\u2019s self-imposed fiscal rules to prioritise investment. The Treasury is expected to be locked in a process with the OBR over the coming weeks to outline its budget measures, before a deadline for the watchdog to finalise its economic and fiscal outlook on 25 October. A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cIt is standard practice for HMT to discuss policies with the OBR as part of the usual budget process to understand their impact on the economy and public finances. \u201cAll judgements underpinning both the economy and fiscal forecasts are at the discretion of the independent OBR which will publish its full forecast alongside the 30 October budget.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-26T12:26:49Z",
            "content": "Chinese leaders have vowed to arrest a slump in the housing market and boost growth after conceding that measures by the central bank to stimulate investment this week were likely to prove inadequate. Promising to deploy \u201cnecessary spending\u201d by the state to meet this year\u2019s economic growth target of 5%, China\u2019s politburo said it would increase benefits for the poorest and give local authorities the cash and power to intervene to prevent further falls in house price values. Households with two or more children will be offered 800 yuan (\u00a385) a month per child, excluding the first child, Reuters reported. Local authorities will have the backing of up to \u00a3213bn in extra borrowing by the state, allowing them to intervene in real estate markets, including buying empty properties. Separately, China is reportedly considering injecting up to 1tn yuan of capital into its biggest state banks to increase their capacity to offer loans. China\u2019s economic growth had been supported by a surge in residential housing developments and rising property values that underpinned consumer spending. An oversupply of homes in recent years has caused prices to tumble in many cities, pushing households into negative equity. Some of the biggest property developers in the world\u2019s second largest economy have either gone bust or been weighed down by huge debts. The planned intervention, which came after a monthly meeting of top Communist party officials, marks a reversal of previous piecemeal policies and an admission by China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, that the ailing economy needed a more coordinated programme of measures backed by a larger package of subsidies. \u201cNew situations and problems\u201d demanded a sense of \u201cresponsibility and urgency\u201d, state media reported, citing the politburo meeting. A wide range of economic data in recent months has fallen short of official forecasts, raising concerns that the growth target was at risk and that a reliance on a combination of rising domestic property values and exports was holding back growth. The 5% growth target is relatively modest by historical standards. China\u2019s central bank cut interest rates and eased local bank lending rules this week in its boldest intervention to boost the economy since the coronavirus pandemic. The People\u2019s Bank of China cut interest rates on existing mortgages by 0.5 percentage points and supported new lending by reducing the level of reserves banks must set aside before making loans. After the politburo announcement, Chinese property shares jumped by more than 8%, and among companies registered in Hong Kong values jumped by 9%. The yuan and Chinese bond yields also rose. The politburo said the government should \u201cpromote the stabilisation of the real estate market\u201d by expanding a list of approved housing projects that could receive further financing and revitalise idle land, according to official news agency reports. Officials \u201cwill respond to people\u2019s concerns, adjust home purchase restriction policies, lower existing mortgage rates and improve land, fiscal, tax and financial policies as soon as possible to push forward the new model of property development\u201d, it said. Bruce Pang, the chief China economist at the real estate services company Jones Lang LaSalle, said the politburo\u2019s endorsement of a further stimulus \u201crepresents a strategic shift in macro policy, from piecemeal policies to a highly orchestrated package in the right direction\u201d. He added: \u201cA pickup in government spending will probably be sufficient to drive a turnaround in business confidence, market sentiment and economic activities, helping China to catch up with potential trend growth.\u201d Xi is understood to have faced criticism from economic advisers, including from Zhu Hengpeng, a member of a government-funded thinktank, who has reportedly disappeared."

            "content": "In cricket a century is a score of 100 or more runs by a batter in a single innings. In Irish cricket a century marks the gulf in time between the sport\u2019s demonisation as a \u201cforeign\u201d import and its metamorphosis into an emblem of a new Ireland. In 1901, nationalists declared a \u201cstruggle to crush English pastimes\u201d and for decades marginalised cricket and other imports such as football and rugby to promote Gaelic football and hurling and to elevate Irish identity. The Gaelic Athletic Association eventually lifted its edicts against non-native sport but for cricket the damage was done. Hugely popular with rich and poor in the 19th century, it limped into the 1990s stereotyped as a niche game for \u201cwest Brits\u201d \u2013 posh Irish anglophiles. Last Sunday Clontarf cricket club, in north Dublin, showed a scene transformed. Ireland\u2019s women\u2019s team hosted \u2013 and beat \u2013 England in a game screened live on free-to-air television. Spectators, including migrants from south Asia, whooped and celebrated. Girls asked the winning players for autographs. \u201cIt shows the direction we\u2019re heading in,\u201d beamed the captain, Gaby Lewis. The victory sealed a golden run for the sport on and off the pitch. Last month the government agreed to build a 4,000-seat cricket stadium to provide a first, permanent home in time for the 2030 T20 men\u2019s World Cup that Ireland will host with England and Scotland. \u201cThat\u2019s a massive turning point for us,\u201d said Richard Holdsworth, the high-performance director of the governing body Cricket Ireland. \u201cOur players now travel the world and see the quality of facilities elsewhere. We need that here.\u201d The new stadium and high-performance centre at the Sport Ireland campus in Abbotstown, west Dublin, will obviate the need to temporarily upgrade club grounds for international fixtures, a recurring, expensive rigmarole that drains finances and complicates fixtures. In June, Belfast city council approved a \u00a325m multi-sport redevelopment project at the Stormont estate that will include a cricket pavilion, another boost to a sport organised on an all-island basis, spanning both sides of the border. Cricket Ireland also hopes to upgrade the grounds of Malahide cricket club, in north Dublin, to international level. The new infrastructure reflects growing visibility and political clout. New clubs are sprouting especially in Dublin and the surrounding Leinster province, which is home to many Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Afghans and others from places where cricket is popular. An estimated 60% of players in Leinster are from south Asia, says Holdsworth. \u201cCricket is in their blood. They\u2019re hugely passionate about it.\u201d Anand Kumar, who was watching the game in Clontarf, said about half of the players at his club in Malahide came from Asia. \u201cCricket is becoming more popular and competitive. You see the pitches getting better.\u201d When Ireland plays India, Kumar roots for his native country while his teenage son cheers for Ireland. Schemes called Smash It and It\u2019s Wicket have drawn children, especially girls, who have followed the feats of players such as Lewis, Orla Prendergast and Amy Hunter. \u201cPeople can see our top players in action and see they are relatable. It\u2019s not the old, stuffy image with cucumber sandwiches,\u201d said Brian MacNeice, the chair of Cricket Ireland. \u201cSuccess breeds success.\u201d Sunday\u2019s dramatic victory \u2013 the first time the Irish women\u2019s team has beaten England in the Twenty20 format \u2013 followed a defeat the previous day and tied a two-game series. At Stormont last month the Irish women completed a 2-0 series win over Sri Lanka, the Asia Cup champions. Ireland\u2019s men\u2019s notched their second ever victory in a Test match \u2013 the game\u2019s longest format \u2013 in July when they beat Zimbabwe. Stella Downes, Cricket Ireland\u2019s president, remembers humbler times for the national team. \u201cTo beat an English county team was all we aspired to. When we beat Middlesex (in 1997) we dined out on that for years.\u201d Several factors contributed to the turnaround. The economy boomed, drawing people from abroad. And the men\u2019s team scored famous wins. At their inaugural World Cup in 2007 the team knocked out Pakistan and made it to the Super Eight stage, prompting a rapturous homecoming. They scored another shock by beating England at the 2011 World Cup. Such triumphs were sporadic but made Ireland a darling of India\u2019s cricket fans, creating opportunity for Irish trade and branding, said Holdsworth. \u201cThe government started to realise the global reach.\u201d Ireland became a full-member of the International Cricket Council in 2017, paving regular encounters with top-notch teams. In Ireland cricket still trails Gaelic football, hurling, soccer and rugby and it is a minnow at international level \u2013 by some estimates 30 times smaller than English cricket. Talent has drifted abroad. Eoin Morgan, who led England to World Cup glory in 2019, is from Dublin. But Downes is bullish about the future. The new stadium, bigger budgets, professional contracts, sponsorship, television deals \u2013 all are enticements to a game no longer deemed foreign but global, she says. \u201cYou can travel the world playing cricket.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-25T22:32:29Z",
            "content": "US Congress passed a three-month government funding package on Wednesday, sending the bill to Joe Biden\u2019s desk and averting a shutdown that was set to begin next Tuesday. The Senate approved the funding package just two hours after the House passed the bill on Wednesday afternoon, as lawmakers raced to return to their home districts six weeks before election day. The bill won significant bipartisan support in both chambers, with the Senate voting 78 to 18 in favor of its passage after the House approved the legislation in a vote of 341 to 82. Every vote against the bill, which will extend government funding until 20 December, came from Republicans. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, unveiled the legislation on Sunday after his original funding proposal failed to pass last week. Johnson\u2019s original bill combined a six-month funding measure with the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (Save) act, a controversial proposal that would require people to show proof of citizenship when they register to vote. Fourteen House Republicans and all but two House Democrats voted against that bill last Wednesday, blocking its passage. Days later, Johnson announced that the House would move forward with a \u201cvery narrow, bare-bones CR\u201d that will extend government funding for three months, conceding to Democrats\u2019 weeks-long demands. \u201cSince we fell a bit short of the goal line, an alternative plan is now required,\u201d Johnson said in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter sent on Sunday. \u201cWhile this is not the solution any of us prefer, it is the most prudent path forward under the present circumstances. As history has taught and current polling affirms, shutting the government down less than 40 days from a fateful election would be an act of political malpractice.\u201d The newly approved bill also includes an additional $231m for the Secret Service \u201cfor operations necessary to carry out protective operations including the 2024 Presidential Campaign and National Special Security Events\u201d, following the two recent assassination attempts against Donald Trump. During the House floor debate over the bill on Wednesday, Tom Cole, the Republican chair of the appropriations committee, urged his colleagues to support the legislation and avert a shutdown that he described as pointless. \u201cIt\u2019s Congress\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the government remains open and serving the American people,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWe are here to avert harmful disruptions to our national security and vital programs our constituents rely on.\u201d The bill was considered under suspension of the rules, meaning Johnson needed the support of two-thirds of the chamber to pass the bill. House Democratic leaders had indicated most of their caucus would support the funding package now that it was devoid of rightwing \u201cpoison pills\u201d, and all present Democrats voted in favor of its passage on Wednesday. \u201cWe have an obligation in this chamber: to rule, to govern, to say to the American people: \u2018We\u2019re here on your behalf,\u2019\u201d Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House appropriations committee, said during the debate. \u201cThe legislative process is not one where one gets everything that they want. It is about compromise. It is about coming together to recognize that we do have this obligation and this responsibility.\u201d The bill attracted significant opposition from hard-right House Republicans, who have voiced staunch criticism of short-term continuing resolutions in the past. \u201cWe irresponsibly continue to spend money that we do not have, that we have not collected, and we continue to retreat to the corners of our safe political spaces and hide behind them in order to try to sell something to the American people,\u201d Chip Roy, a hard-right House Republican of Texas, said during the debate. \u201cThe American people look at us, and they go: \u2018What on earth is wrong in Washington?\u2019\u201d Roy predicted that the passage of the continuing resolution would lead to the House approving a much broader full-year funding bill, known as an omnibus, before their December recess. Johnson has firmly denied that accusation, telling reporters at a press conference on Tuesday: \u201cWe have broken the Christmas [omnibus], and I have no intention of going back to that terrible tradition \u2026 We\u2019ll deal with that in the lame duck.\u201d During the floor debate, Cole suggested that the results of the November elections would provide Congress with clearer guidance on how to proceed on a full-year funding package. \u201cWe\u2019re either going to shut the government down, without achieving anything by shutting it down, or we\u2019re going to keep it open and keep working on our problems and, frankly, give the American people an opportunity in the election \u2013 through their votes and their voice \u2013 to decide who\u2019s coming back here,\u201d Cole said. \u201cAnd I suspect that will clarify a lot of decisions in front of us.\u201d Once the House passed the funding bill, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate majority leader, moved immediately to take up the legislation. Schumer had expressed frustration over the last-minute nature of the funding deal despite widespread expectations that negotiations would ultimately end with a three-month continuing resolution. Schumer blamed the delay on Trump, who had urged Republican lawmakers to reject any funding bill that did not include \u201celection security\u201d provisions. \u201cThis agreement could have very easily been reached weeks ago, but Speaker Johnson and House Republicans chose to listen to Donald Trump\u2019s partisan demands instead of working with us from the start to reach a bicameral, bipartisan agreement,\u201d Schumer said on Monday. \u201cThat is outlandishly cynical: Donald Trump knows perfectly well that a shutdown would mean chaos, pain, needless heartache for the American people. But as usual, he just doesn\u2019t seem to care.\u201d It remains unclear how or when Trump might retaliate against Johnson for failing to pass a funding bill linked to \u201celection security\u201d measures. Johnson has downplayed any suggestion of a potential rift between him and Trump, insisting there is \u201cno daylight\u201d between their positions. \u201cPresident Trump understands the current dilemma and the situation that we\u2019re in,\u201d Johnson told reporters earlier on Tuesday. \u201cSo we\u2019ll continue working closely together. I\u2019m not defying President Trump. We\u2019re getting our job done, and I think he understands that.\u201d"

            "content": "Robert Jenrick is facing further questions about donations totalling \u00a375,000 to his Conservative leadership campaign from a firm that was loaned money via a tax haven, after a businessman revealed himself to be the ultimate source of the funding. Jenrick, the former immigration minister, has been criticised over the transparency of his funding after it emerged that the campaign donation came from a company that had been loaned money from another firm based in the British Virgin Islands. Phillip Ullmann, an entrepreneur, revealed on Monday that he had given the money to the Tory leadership frontrunner through Spott Fitness, a fitness coaching app provider that he said was \u201cpart of my family\u2019s group of businesses\u201d. However, Ullmann\u2019s name does not appear on the list of people with significant control in Spott Fitness at Companies House, leaving questions about his role in the organisation. On Sunday, Labour wrote to the Electoral Commission asking for an investigation into the origin of the money after Jenrick received three donations of \u00a325,000 from the business in July. Labour sources said on Monday there were still questions to answer about the arrangement even after Ullmann revealed himself to be behind the company. The company\u2019s accounts show it has no employees, has never made a profit and has more than \u00a3300,000 of debts, and in January it registered a loan from Centrovalli, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands. In a statement on Monday, Ullmann said he wanted to avoid suggestions that he was \u201chiding anything\u201d and insisted he understood the importance of transparency surrounding political donations. \u201cI\u2019ve been a successful businessman over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in recent times I\u2019ve become concerned about the grave challenges facing the UK and the rest of the world. I tried, unsuccessfully, to make some of that right by changing my businesses into social enterprises. But I\u2019ve come to see that we need huge political change.\u201d He added: \u201cI wanted to back Robert Jenrick, whose serious solutions to big challenges \u2013 including on migration \u2013 appeal to me. I don\u2019t agree with him on everything but broadly we are aligned. I chose to give the money from Spott Fitness, a company which is part of my family\u2019s group of businesses. It\u2019s a phenomenal company that\u2019s using tech to improve people\u2019s health and will be a hugely successful business. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want there to be any suggestion at all that I\u2019m hiding anything and I understand the importance of donor transparency. So I\u2019m happy to confirm my connection to Spott. I love my country, I was born and raised in the UK and have always paid tax and lived here. I\u2019m going to continue to set out my ideas for changing the world and our financial system and am always happy to meet with people and set out my ideas in this space.\u201d Ellie Reeves, the Labour chair, said in a letter to the Electoral Commission on Sunday: \u201cDonations to MPs must come from sources registered in the UK. It is clear that Jenrick has serious questions to answer about the origin of these funds and their legality.\u201d Jenrick\u2019s campaign has said the donations were properly and legally declared. Jenrick told Sky News on Sunday that the donations were \u201cperfectly legal and valid\u201d."

            "content": "For more than 15 years, university students and staff have borne the brunt of a broken system. Tuition fees helped turn higher education into a quasi-market, transforming students into indebted consumers and staff into precarious workers. Lord Mandelson\u2019s support for Britain\u2019s universities is welcome, but it is unfortunate that he appears relaxed about making students and staff pay the price \u2013 yet again \u2013 for patching up the sector\u2019s finances (Universities are in a hole: linking student fees to inflation is the fairest way forward, 25 September). Not only does Mandelson suggest students are penalised with tuition fee hikes, he takes aim at the student-staff ratio, suggesting it is much too low. This is hard to interpret as anything other than a call for job cuts, which Mandelson frames in the cynical phrase of the hour as \u201ctough choices\u201d. The truth is that to raise tuition fees would be to double down on the unstable market-led model that has landed universities in this mess. Massive public investment in higher education \u2013 perhaps Britain\u2019s last world-leading sector \u2013 is the only sustainable solution. That would require real \u201ctough choices\u201d, such as facing down Treasury-think and taxing the rich. Dr Jo Grady General secretary, University and College Union \u2022 Linking fees to inflation may assist our universities in their financial upkeep, as Peter Mandelson argues. But students are paying exorbitant interest on their loans. My daughter\u2019s interest rate (she is in her third year at university) rocketed from 8% to 13.5% in one leap and interest is accrued from the date the loan is made, not from graduation. Before we embark on a course of action that will see student indebtedness rocket further, it would be prudent to legislate a fairer rate of interest on the tens of thousands borrowed by so many young people embarking on adult life and struggling to make their way in a relatively low-wage, high\u2011cost economy. Nicola Gabb Antrim \u2022 I have been a senior lecturer in law for 20 years, many of which were at Manchester Metropolitan University. Lord Mandelson\u2019s suggestion that the tutor-student ratio is increased is sensible, as long as tutors are able to devote their time to academic work. But the reality is that drastic cuts, labelled as \u201ccentralising or reorganisation\u201d of support systems, mean lecturers are charged with resolving administrative and systemic debacles. The ability to prepare, teach and meaningfully engage with our students, which remains our purpose and joy, is curtailed and devalued. The financial rewards for the decision-makers in upper management, however, appear unaffected by the funding crisis that is given as the reason for increased workloads and job cuts. Francoise Smith Astley, Greater Manchester \u2022 Lord Mandelson draws some curious conclusions about how teaching in universities should change. He sees higher staff-to-student ratios as a positive metric, implying larger seminars, and he recommends some universities abandon research. I would be surprised if my students would welcome less contact with lecturers, and I know I\u2019m a better researcher and tutor for pursuing my specialism in both domains. Lower standards won\u2019t save UK higher education. Richard Huzzey Durham \u2022 Do you have a photograph you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? If so, please click here to upload it.

            "date": "2024-09-26T20:56:29Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden signed a three-month government funding bill on Thursday, averting an imminent shutdown and delaying a fuller conversation about government spending until after the November elections. The stopgap spending bill, known as a continuing resolution or CR, will extend government funding until 20 December. It will also provide an additional $231m for the Secret Service \u201cfor operations necessary to carry out protective operations including the 2024 presidential campaign and national special security events\u201d, following the two recent assassination attempts against Donald Trump. Biden\u2019s signing of the bill came one day after the House and Senate passed the legislation with sweeping bipartisan majorities in both chambers. \u201cThe passage of this bill gives Congress more time to pass full-year funding bills by the end of this year,\u201d Biden said Wednesday. \u201cMy administration will work with Congress to ensure these bills deliver for America\u2019s national defense, veterans, seniors, children and working families, and address urgent needs for the American people, including communities recovering from disasters.\u201d The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, had initially tried to pass a more rightwing proposal that combined a six-month stopgap funding measure with the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (Save) Act, a controversial proposal that would require people to show proof of citizenship when they register to vote. That effort failed last week, when 14 Republicans and all but two Democrats opposed Johnson\u2019s bill. The failure forced Johnson to take up a three-month spending bill that was narrow enough to win Democrats\u2019 support. The House passed that bill on Wednesday in a vote of 341 to 82, with all of the opposition to the legislation stemming from Republicans. \u201cOur legislative work before November has now been officially done, and today the House did the necessary thing,\u201d Johnson told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cWe took the initiative and passed a clean, narrow, three-month CR to prevent the Senate from jamming us with another bloated bill while continuing resolutions.\u201d Johnson nodded at the widespread opposition to the bill within his conference, as 82 Republicans voted against it amid complaints of wasteful government spending. \u201cWhile a continuing resolution is never ideal \u2013 none of us like them; that\u2019s not a way to run a railroad \u2013 it allows Congress to continue serving the American people through the election,\u201d Johnson said. Once the House passed the continuing resolution on Wednesday afternoon, the Senate moved immediately to take up the bill. The upper chamber passed the bill just two hours after the House did in a bipartisan vote of 78 to 18. The Democratic Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, thanked Johnson for his work to avoid a shutdown, but he lamented that it took Congress until the last minute to pass a funding package when it seemed evident for weeks that a narrow stopgap would be necessary. \u201cTonight the American people can sleep easier knowing we have avoided an unnecessary government shutdown at the end of the month,\u201d Schumer said before the vote. \u201cIt is a relief for the country that, once again, bipartisanship prevailed to stop another shutdown threat. It took much longer than it should have, but because House Republicans finally, finally chose to work with us in the end, Congress is getting the job done tonight.\u201d Schumer had previously blamed Donald Trump for the delay, as the former president had implored Republican lawmakers to reject any funding bill unless it was tied to \u201celection security\u201d measures. The newly signed bill did not meet that demand, but Johnson insisted that Trump backed Republicans\u2019 efforts to keep the government funded. \u201cPresident Trump understands the current dilemma and the situation that we\u2019re in,\u201d Johnson told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cSo we\u2019ll continue working closely together. I\u2019m not defying President Trump. We\u2019re getting our job done, and I think he understands that.\u201d Both chambers of Congress now stand adjourned for six weeks, meaning members will not return to Capitol Hill until after election day. Johnson\u2019s decision to rely on Democratic support to pass the funding package has raised questions about his future as speaker, but he voiced confidence on Wednesday about his leadership and his party\u2019s prospects for expanding its narrow House majority. \u201cI would be a fool to project a certain number of seats, but let me just say I\u2019m very optimistic,\u201d Johnson told reporters. \u201cI believe we\u2019re going to hold the House. And I intend to be the speaker in the new Congress.\u201d"

            "content": "US secretary of state Antony Blinken was briefed during his trip to Kyiv on elements of a Ukrainian plan to push Russia to end the war, US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Tuesday. Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy is expected to present the plan on the sidelines of the UN general assembly meeting in New York next week. Earlier on Tuesday, the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Washington had seen the plan. \u201cWe think it lays out a strategy and a plan that can work,\u201d she said. A Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire and forced partial evacuation of residents in the town of Toropets in the western part of Russia\u2019s Tver region, regional authorities said on Wednesday. Fire fighters were trying to contain the fire, Igor Rudenya, the governor of the region located northwest of Moscow, said in a post on the Telegram messaging channel of the region\u2019s administration. He did not say what was burning. According to a RIA state news agency report from 2018, Russia was building an arsenal for the storage of missiles, ammunition and explosives in Toropets, a 1,000-year-old town, which has a population of just over 11,000. There was no information about casualties. Russian forces captured the Ukrainian town of Ukrainsk in the eastern Donetsk region on Tuesday, Russian state-run RIA news agency and pro-Russian war bloggers reported, as they advanced westwards in a bid to take the whole of the Donbas. Russian troops raised their flag on a mine ventilation shaft on the outskirts of the town, which had a population of over 10,000 people before the war, RIA reported, citing an unidentified source in the Russian military. The General Staff of Ukraine\u2019s military, in a late evening report, said nothing about Ukrainsk changing hands, referring to it as one of several localities under Russian attack. It said 34 assaults had been recorded near the town of Pokrovsk. Reuters was unable to immediately verify battlefield claims from either side due to reporting restrictions in the war zone. A false claim circulating on social media that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris left a 13-year-old girl paralysed after an alleged hit-and-run in San Francisco in 2011 is the work of a covert Russian disinformation operation, according to new research by Microsoft. Researchers found that the operation created a video, paid an actor to appear as the alleged victim, and spread the claim through a fake website for a non-existent San Francisco news outlet named \u201cKBSF-TV\u201d. The Russian group responsible, which Microsoft calls Storm-1516, is described as a Kremlin-aligned troll farm. Facebook owner Meta said on Monday it was banning RT, Rossiya Segodnya and other Russian state media networks from its platforms, claiming the outlets had used deceptive tactics to carry out covert influence operations online. The ban, strongly criticised by the Kremlin, marks a sharp escalation in measures by the world\u2019s biggest social media company against Russian state media, after years of more limited steps such as blocking the outlets from running ads and reducing the reach of their posts. Russian forces heavily shelled an area of Ukraine\u2019s south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region late on Tuesday, killing two people and injuring five, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said. Fedorov, writing on Telegram, said rescue teams were searching under rubble in the town of Komishuvakha, southeast of the regional centre of Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian heavyweight boxing Olympic champion Oleksandr Usyk has been released after detention by law enforcement officers at Poland\u2019s Krakow airport, Zelenskiy said on Wednesday. \u201cI was outraged by this attitude towards our citizen and champion,\u201d Zelenskiy said on the Telegram messaging app. \u201cOur champion was released and no one is detaining him any more.\u201d It was not immediately clear why the 37-year-old Usyk was detained. The WBC, WBO and WBA champion, who won gold at the 2012 London Olympics, has been a national hero aiding Kyiv\u2019s war efforts. \u201cFriends, everything is fine,\u201d Usyk said in an Instagram post. \u201cThere was a misunderstanding that was quickly resolved. Thank you to everyone who was concerned.\u201d Usyk\u2019s charity fund, Usyk Foundation, aids Kyiv\u2019s forces in the war that Russia launched with a full-scale invasion against Ukraine in 2022. It buys ambulances and delivers humanitarian aid to the front line."

            "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he believes the war with Russia is \u201ccloser to the end\u201d than many believe and called on allies to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s army. In excerpts of an interview with ABC News\u2019 Good Morning America, set to be broadcast in full on Tuesday, the president said \u201cI think that we are closer to the peace than we think \u2026 We are closer to the end of the war.\u201d He added: \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re asking our friends, our allies, to strengthen us. It\u2019s very important.\u201d Zelenskyy told ABC that Putin is \u201cafraid\u201d of Ukraine\u2019s Kursk operation, in which it has taken more than 1,000 square km of Russian territory. Zelenskyy is in the US to attend sessions at the UN general assembly as well as to present a \u201cvictory plan\u201d to US President Joe Biden and presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. After a bipartisan meeting with members of the US Congress, Zelenskyy also said \u201cdecisive action now could hasten the just end of Russian aggression against Ukraine next year.\u201d The US played a \u201ccritical role\u201d in protecting freedom around the world, he said in a Telegram post, and praised the US Congress and both main parties for their \u201cunwavering commitment to this cause\u201d. His comments came as Republican presidential candidate Trump suggested Zelenskyy wanted Harris to win the November election. \u201cI think Zelenskyy is the greatest salesman in history. Every time he comes into the country, he walks away with 60 billion dollars,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Pennsylvania. \u201cHe wants them [the Democrats] to win this election so badly.\u201d Trump said if he wins the election, he would call Putin and Zelenskyy and urge them to reach a deal to end the war. Foreign ministers of the G7 major democracies were on Monday to discuss the issue of sending long-range missiles to Ukraine that could be used to hit Russian territory, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the UN general assembly, Borrell said it was clear that Russia was receiving new weapons, including Iranian missiles despite Tehran\u2019s repeated denials. Zelenskiy also held talks in New York with German, Indian and Japanese leaders on Monday trying to shore up support for Kyiv\u2019s war efforts. \u201cWe talked about how to make a just peace closer,\u201d Zelenskiy said on his Telegram messaging app after meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. \u201cThe main thing is to maintain unity.\u201d He said he had discussed energy aid with Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida, and that Delhi and Kyiv were \u201cdynamically developing\u201d their relations after a meeting with prime minister Narendra Modi. Jails controlled by Russia are deliberately withholding medical care for Ukrainian prisoners, with doctors in one prison even taking part in what it called \u201ctorture\u201d, according to a commission mandated by the UN rights council. The commission, set up by the Human Rights Council to investigate violations in Ukraine since Russia\u2019s invasion, had already concluded that Moscow\u2019s occupying forces were using torture \u201csystematically\u201d. But in his oral report to the council, commission chair Erik Mose said torture had become a \u201ccommon and acceptable practice\u201d, with Russian authorities acting with \u201ca sense of impunity\u201d. A UN-backed human rights expert monitoring Russia decried on Monday increased violence in the country caused by former prisoners who have their sentences shortened or pardoned to fight in Ukraine and then return home. Mariana Katzarova said the return home to Russia of former criminals who have had their legal slates wiped clean is adding to more domestic violence. Katzarova said an estimated 170,000 convicted violent criminals have been recruited to fight in Ukraine. \u201cMany of them who return \u2013 and this is an emerging trend \u2013 have been perpetrating new violent crimes to begin with against women, against girls, against children, including sexual violence and killings,\u201d she said in Geneva. Katzarova also said the rights situation inside Russia had become \u201cmuch worse\u201d over the past year amid a tightening \u201cstate-sponsored system of fear and punishment\u201d. \u201cNobody is safe,\u201d Katzarova said. Already a year ago, the independent expert said repression had hit unprecedented\u201d levels. But the quashing of dissent had intensified since then, Katzarova warned. Ukraine accused Russia at an international court on Monday of flouting sea law by trying to keep the Kerch Strait between mainland Russia and annexed Crimea under its sole control. Kyiv began proceedings at The Hague-based intergovernmental Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2016 after Moscow began building the 19 km (12 mile) Crimea Bridge link to the peninsula it seized from Ukraine two years previously. The bridge is crucial for the supply of fuel, food and other products to Crimea, where the port of Sevastopol is the historic home base of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet, and became a major supply route for troops after Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022. Russian forces launched the latest of a series of strikes on Ukraine\u2019s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia on Monday evening, killing one person, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said. A city official, quoted by public broadcaster Suspilne, put the injury toll at five, including a 13-year-old girl. Strikes on the city earlier in the day and the previous night wounded at least 23. Ukrainian shelling killed three people, including a child, in the Russian border village of Arkhangelskoe, the provincial governor said Monday. \u201cThe village came under shelling by the Ukrainian armed forces. Two adults and a teenager were killed by the enemy strike,\u201d Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a post on Telegram. Russia will not test a nuclear weapon as long as the United States refrains from testing, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s point man for arms control said on Monday after speculation that the Kremlin might abandon its post-Soviet nuclear test moratorium. \u201cNothing has changed,\u201d deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov, who is in charge of Russian arms control policy, told Russian news agencies about the speculation that a nuclear test could be Russia\u2019s answer to missile strikes deep into Russia. Russia\u2019s Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile \u2013 known in the west as Satan II \u2013 appears to have suffered a \u201ccatastrophic failure\u201d during a test launch, according to analysis of satellite images. The images captured by Maxar on 21 September show a crater about 60 metres wide at the launch silo at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia. They reveal extensive damage that was not visible in pictures taken earlier in the month."

            "date": "2024-09-06T01:39:41Z",
            "content": "Vladimir Putin on Thursday said his main aim in Ukraine after 30 months of fighting was to capture the eastern Donbas area. The Russian offensive in February 2022 failed in its expansive goal to capture the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in the west, and Moscow has been unable to take full control of its supposedly annexed oblasts \u2013 administrative regions \u2013 of Luhansk and Donetsk in the geographical Donbas region. Putin claimed the Ukrainian offensive in Russia\u2019s Kursk region had no effect, and that by bringing \u201cquite well-prepared units\u201d into Kursk from elsewhere, Ukraine had made Moscow\u2019s advance in Donbas quicker. \u201cThe enemy weakened itself in key areas, our army has accelerated its offensive operations.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s top military commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, countered Putin\u2019s narrative in an interview broadcast on Thursday, saying the Kursk incursion was working and that there had been no Russian advances on Pokrovsk, a key sector of the Ukrainian front, for six days. \u201cThe enemy hasn\u2019t advanced a single metre in the direction. In other words, our strategy is working,\u201d he told CNN. Syrskyi said the military had also noted a decrease in shelling, and in the intensity of the Russian offensive in other sectors. The Institute for the Study of War wrote this week in an assessment on the Kursk offensive: \u201cThe wider impacts of the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast on the war and any envisioned diplomatic solution to the war are not yet clear, and assessments of these impacts are premature.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Thursday that Ukraine was \u201cmaintaining the defined lines\u201d in the Kursk region and one goal was to show Russians \u201cwhat is more important to him [Putin]: occupation of the territories of Ukraine or the protection of his population\u201d, while also strengthening Ukraine\u2019s hand for \u201cfair\u201d negotiations. Ukraine has achieved \u201ca lot\u201d in its Kursk offensive into Russia but it\u2019s hard to say how the situation will develop next, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Thursday. \u201cOnly the Ukrainians can make the difficult choices that are needed, such as where to deploy their forces and what type of warfare is appropriate in this situation.\u201d Stoltenberg emphasised that Ukraine had the right to self-defence, including having the opportunity to hit military targets on Russian territory. \u201cI am glad that many Nato countries have given that opportunity, and those that still have restrictions have softened the restrictions so that Ukraine can defend itself,\u201d Stoltenberg said. Kamikaze drones again attacked Ukraine on Thursday night, while Ukrainian air defence issued a warning of possible ballistic missile strikes. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, said a fire broke in warehouses out after a drone strike on Malekhiv, a district outside the Ukrainian city in Ukraine\u2019s far west. Germany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and Zelenskiy will meet on Friday in Frankfurt, according to a German government spokesman. The \u201cone-on-one\u201d talks will come as Ukraine\u2019s military backers, including the US, hold their regular Ramstein Group meeting at the German airbase of the same name. The US defence chief, Lloyd Austin, is due to host the meeting. The UK will send 650 new lightweight multirole missile (LMM) systems to Ukraine by the end of the year, the British government has announced. The missiles, also known as Martlet, are made by Thales in Belfast and perform \u201ca lightweight, precision strike multi-role missile\u201d according to the manufacturer. The UK has already provided hundreds of LMMs to Ukraine for air defence, the British defence ministry said, and they have been used to destroy Russian drones and other aerial threats. They can be fired from a shoulder launcher, from an armoured vehicle or mobile launcher, or from the air. Ukraine\u2019s parliament has approved the appointment of Andrii Sybiha as foreign minister, replacing Dmytro Kuleba as part of the biggest government reshuffle since the full-scale Russian invasion, Peter Beaumont writes. Critics have said that the reshuffle represents a consolidation of power by a small group of Zelenskiy loyalists allied with Andriy Yermak, the head of the president\u2019s office. Zelenskiy has demanded quick results from his new top team \u2013 calling on them to deliver more investment into Ukraine\u2019s arms sector, advance negotiations on EU membership, work to secure Ukraine\u2019s financial stability and deliver \u201cmore support for the frontline\u201d. The death toll from a Russian missile strike on Ukraine\u2019s city of Poltava rose to 55 with more than 300 wounded, Ukrainian officials said on Thursday. The strike hit the Poltava military communications institute on Tuesday, according to Ukrainian officials who did not specify how many of the victims were military or civilian. The US charged five Russian military officers on Thursday with conducting cyberattacks on civilian systems in Ukraine and other systems in the US and Nato countries. FBI special agent William DelBagno said the WhisperGate malware attack in January 2022 \u201ccould be considered the first shot of the war\u201d and was intended to cripple Ukraine\u2019s government and critical infrastructure by targeting financial systems, agriculture, emergency services, healthcare and schools, DelBagno said. All remain at large, wanted along with a civilian Russian hacker for a combined $60m reward. Poland backed away on Thursday from earlier claims that a drone had likely entered its airspace during a Russian attack on Ukraine in August, after a 10-day analysis and search for the object produced no results. General Maciej Klisz, head of the Polish army\u2019s operational command, said it was \u201ca very high probability there was no violation of the airspace of the Republic of Poland on August 26.\u201d He said, however, that violations were likely to happen again during Russian attacks on Ukraine. Ukraine said 75 countries and international organisations have agreed a \u201cshared vision\u201d of measures to ensure the uninterrupted supply of Ukrainian agricultural products and help global food security, in a follow-up meeting to the peace summit hosted by Switzerland in June. They also also committed to additional efforts to implement international law during the online meeting."

            "date": "2024-09-14T04:00:17Z",
            "content": "On 10 May 2024, Haroon Nafas was in his family\u2019s guesthouse in Baghlan, north Afghanistan, spending time with friends who had come to stay. It had been raining lightly all through the afternoon, but at about 3pm the group heard a loud crashing noise. \u201cWe immediately went outside to see what was causing the sound,\u201d says Nafas. \u201cInitially, we were confused, thinking it might have been a plane. But then we realised, no, it\u2019s a flood.\u201d Nafas rushed home to his own house, which fortunately was located up on a hillside, and started gathering his family. Meanwhile, several town members sought shelter atop the local mosque, including Nafas\u2019s brothers, who used a mulberry tree to climb on to the roof and reach safety. Others were not so lucky. \u201cThe flood was very severe, maybe up to 30 metres high,\u201d says Nafas. \u201cPeople were even dragged in from the roofs of certain buildings. The damage from the waters spread several kilometres. Some households lost up to 11 family members.\u201d Over two days, at least 315 people were killed in Baghlan and more than 2,000 homes destroyed. About 1,600 people were injured, and hundreds more were missing. Flash floods also wreaked havoc in other provinces across Afghanistan, with at least 50 people killed in Ghor. Afghanistan has always been prone to natural disasters. Among low-income nations, it ranked second in the number of deaths caused by them between 1980 and 2015, according to one report. However, the frequency and extremity of disasters such as flash flooding is on the rise, and climate breakdown is not solely responsible for these changes. The country\u2019s history of armed conflict has exacerbated the situation severely. Dr Najibullah Sadid, an environmental researcher and water resources expert based in Germany, says it is crucial that warring parties are held more accountable as toxic artillery often gets left behind and damages the environment. Explosives can damage ecosystems, disrupt biodiversity and weaken soil structure, and can damage groundwater resources. According to a report by the Progressive magazine, the US dropped more than 85,000 bombs on Afghanistan between 2001 and 2021. In spots where massive ordnance air blast bombs, nicknamed \u201cthe mother of all bombs\u201d, were dropped, such as Nangarhar province, scientists have found that plant yields halved due to the spread of toxins. Such toxins can also be carried to other regions by the wind or in water. Mine contamination is another problem. As of 2021, only one of Afghanistan\u2019s 34 provinces had ever (temporarily) been declared mine-free. The remaining 33 provinces still have explosive ordnance scattered across them. Despite this, funding for the country\u2019s mine action sector has been declining, from $113m (\u00a386m) in 2011 to $32m in 2020. The Taliban takeover in August 2021 has threatened these streams further, as many donors remain reluctant to engage with the new government, despite improved operating conditions and access to previously unreachable locations. According to the United Nations Mine Action Service about 45,000 Afghan civilians have been killed or wounded by landmines since 1989. Sadid says the mines have a direct connection to the recent flash floods: \u201cLandmines [and] de-mining activity disrupt soil structure. Disrupt this, and you are basically exposing the soil to erosion. The debris flow in Baghlan, for example, can be linked to war because the floods originated from a valley which is completely dry.\u201d Conflict-caused deforestation also worsens flash floods. In 1970, Afghanistan had 2.8m hectares (6.9m acres) of forest, covering 4.5% of the country. By 2016, this had shrunk to about 1.5%. In Nuristan, a province in eastern Afghanistan, forest cover had reduced by 53% in that time. \u201cVegetation retains a lot of rainwater,\u201d says Sadid. \u201cWhen there is no forest, the land becomes exposed to landslides, and the runoff increases. That\u2019s why we now see very extreme flash floods occurring in some parts of Afghanistan.\u201d For Sayed Abdul Baset, a disaster risk reduction expert and Herat resident, the issue hits close to home. The former adviser to the Afghan government says there is still an opportunity to unite and mobilise despite the problems caused by climate breakdown. \u201cThese natural disasters are related to the activities of the land,\u201d he says. \u201cThey show how unsafe our homes are, how weak our coping capacity and early warning systems are. We don\u2019t have water pipes. The topography of the soil is not good. There is no flood zoning. People live in floodplains. It is a very painful picture. It is no less than a war.\u201d Sohila Akbari, who is based in Herat, has been leading humanitarian efforts as part of a 12-woman team for more than a decade. With financial contributions collected from the Afghan diaspora and donors abroad, her grassroots organisation Committee Akbari regularly distributes emergency aid such as food, clothes and tents to the city\u2019s poorest and disaster-struck. \u201cI first started interacting with those struggling through my work as a teacher,\u201d says Akbari. \u201cSlowly, I started to develop an interest in finding other ways to help. I\u2019ve since connected with Afghans all over to try to take the work further.\u201d Akbari was herself a victim of the devastating series of earthquakes that hit Herat in October 2023, killing more than 2,000 people. \u201cIt was a very horrible day. We hadn\u2019t experienced an earthquake in years. It took us all by surprise.\u201d She recalls hearing a horrible noise that resembled explosions. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even stand. The ground would go out from under you. Our house was on the third floor so it was especially bad. I remember telling the children to run, just run. Don\u2019t worry about me. They ran. I was in the stairwell when the ceiling caved. I thought I was finished.\u201d They spent the next few days seeking shelter in a local school. After two days, Akbari resumed her distribution efforts to those who had been most severely affected. \u201cWe are in the city. What else can we do if we don\u2019t help? We will do our best. What little we can do, we will do it,\u201d she says. It is through locals such as Akbari, who are already familiar with the people affected, that aid can have the most successful outcome, says the longtime climate journalist Laurie Goering. \u201cThis is the giant question in climate finance right now. How do you actually move such big amounts of money from governments and organisations to those women in Afghanistan? Taking advantage of local systems and actors, and finding intermediary groups to get more of that money to where it\u2019s needed is really important,\u201d Goering says. As for how much compensation warring states owe for the destruction caused in Afghanistan, Goering refers to the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s loss and damage fund as a good place to start. This is a new fund aimed at helping impoverished nations cope with the damage caused by climate-induced natural disasters. Support will be offered in the form of grants. \u201cThe fund is designed to help communities and countries recover from things they couldn\u2019t have adapted to,\u201d says Goering. \u201cSo that money would be really useful in places like Afghanistan.\u201d Since their rise to power in August 2021, the Taliban have remained excluded from the global stage. For Goering, this poses an extra challenge: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get funds if you\u2019re excluded from international systems. There\u2019s a lot of thinking at the moment about how to move money to very vulnerable places without going through the government.\u201d Despite Afghanistan being one of the countries most vulnerable to global heating, due to its arid climate, mountainous topography and reliance on agriculture, it was once again excluded from the Cop28 climate talks last year, something Goering says is problematic. \u201cAfghanistan doesn\u2019t have high emissions,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is something that\u2019s happening globally, that everybody must work on together. Otherwise, we won\u2019t solve the problem.\u201d It is a sentiment shared by Rahmani, who believes support from international institutions and existing data could go a long way: \u201cWe need to create a roadmap for each region of Afghanistan. Also, 60% of Afghans are young. They can be taught. With a very small budget, they can be provided with employment, education and training in the climate field.\u201d However, to truly muster the potential of younger generations, Rahmani admits better climate awareness is a crucial first step: \u201cPeople think that this is God\u2019s will, that because of our sins, these disasters happen to us and that we can\u2019t do anything about it. Such beliefs and social behaviours have a lot of impact.\u201d Rahmani also hopes to see more remediation from warring parties, as well as high-emitting nations. \u201cThese countries have a responsibility,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is happening because of them. Places like the United States, England, Brazil and China \u2013 they keep their industry alive with fossil fuels and adapt themselves and raise their resilience. But for Afghanistan, which is currently very limited in terms of global relations, those conditions are completely closed.\u201d In March, the UN security council voted to extend its mission in Afghanistan for another year, but this is focused mostly on the humanitarian crisis rather than climate impacts. There is also an ongoing parliamentary inquiry in the Netherlands on the impact of the Dutch and Nato\u2019s 20-year intervention in Afghanistan. Similar initiatives by other countries embedded in the Nato campaign could accelerate reparations and aid. For Rahmani, prioritising smart policies and expanding irrigation projects, such as those implemented in recent years across Nangarhar province, is the way to go. \u201cWe had a very large climate project a while ago, backed by millions of dollars. But unfortunately, all the work is suspended. We need funds. These are very serious issues. It is very necessary for the people of the world to be united so that we can solve these problems.\u201d Since the Taliban takeover in 2021, large-scale conflict has reduced significantly. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, no new conflict displacement was recorded in 2023. However, by the end of that year, there were still 1.5 million people internally displaced as a result of natural disasters. For Baghlan resident Nafas, the most pressing need for those affected is clean water. He hopes the humanitarian response offers a solution before the situation on the ground worsens. \u201cThe tap systems have all been damaged,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the canals are covered with mud. There is no drinking water, no water for ablution, for people\u2019s livestock, for agriculture. Incomes have also been suspended. People are living in makeshift tents. It\u2019s chaos.

            "date": "2024-09-13T19:41:04Z",
            "content": "US officials and lawmakers shot back after Vladimir Putin said that Nato\u2019s potential lifting of restrictions on Ukraine to launch long-range strikes over the border into Russian territory would mean Nato countries were \u201cat war\u201d with Russia. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, met with the US president, Joe Biden, on Friday at the White House, where the two were expected to discuss \u2013 though not necessarily announce \u2013 a loosening of restrictions on Storm Shadow missiles that would allow Ukraine to strike targets as far as 155 miles inside Russia. \u201cThis will mean that Nato countries \u2013 the United States and European countries \u2013 are at war with Russia,\u201d Putin told Russian reporters on Thursday. \u201cAnd if this is the case, then, bearing in mind the change in the essence of the conflict, we will make appropriate decisions in response to the threats that will be posed to us.\u201d The missiles are jointly produced in the UK and France, and both countries appear to be seeking Biden\u2019s go-ahead to loosen restrictions on the use of the long-range missiles. Western officials have indicated that the US is not planning to allow its own missiles to be used to strike targets deeper inside Russia. Washington and London have indicated they do not plan to announce any change in policy. Moscow\u2019s ambassador to the UN told the security council on Friday that loosening the restrictions would mark an escalation to \u201cdirect war\u201d between Moscow and Nato. The remarks provoked an angry response in Washington, where officials accused the Russian ruler of sabre-rattling in order to scare Nato countries away from supporting Ukraine. Senator Jim Risch, the ranking member of the Senate foreign relations committee, said Ukraine should have authorisation to strike targets deep inside Russia, including active Russian bombers launching missiles against Ukrainian cities. \u201cPutin\u2019s latest threats about direct confrontation with Nato are simply an effort to coerce the west out of supporting Ukraine,\u201d Risch said. \u201cHe knows that long-range strikes from Ukraine would cause significant damage to his war effort. Several Russian missiles have landed in Nato territory and Nato has not escalated. \u201cUkraine must be allowed to defend itself, period. If that means striking a Russian bomber launching missiles at Ukrainian civilians from Russian airspace, then Ukraine should be able to take that shot,\u201d he added. Speaking with reporters on Friday, the US national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said that there would probably be no announcements about the lifting of restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s use of British and French-supplied missiles in Ukraine. But at the same time, he said that the US and its Nato allies have \u201cour own calculus for what we decide to provide to Ukraine\u201d. \u201cI never said that we don\u2019t take Mr Putin\u2019s threats seriously. He starts brandishing the nuclear sword, for instance, yeah, we take that seriously. We constantly monitor that. He obviously has proven capable of aggression. He\u2019s obviously proven capable of escalation \u2026 But it is not something that we haven\u2019t heard before. So we take note of it. We got it,\u201d Kirby said. Biden and Starmer were meeting for their second time at the White House after last month\u2019s Nato summit, which was held just days after Labour won the UK general election and retook power after 14 years in opposition. The two leaders were expected to discuss a host of foreign policy topics, including Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, the Aukus partnership between the UK, Australia and US, and more. The Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is expected to present his \u201cvictory plan\u201d to Biden on the sidelines of the UN general assembly this month. Pressure is growing on Ukraine in the run-up to the US presidential elections, which could see Donald Trump return to power. As fevered discussions over the future of the war take place behind closed doors, Washington and its allies have continued to pledge to stand behind Ukraine in the war. \u201cWe are going to do everything that we can so that Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself,\u201d said the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, on Friday. \u201cThat is our commitment. I think you have seen this, a very much focused, a tremendous amount of support from this administration and also from our partners and allies in doing just that. And that\u2019s what you could expect to see.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-29T10:05:50Z",
            "content": "European foreign ministers have stepped up calls for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, amid concern that Israel\u2019s killing of Hezbollah\u2019s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, risks seriously destabilising Lebanon and the region. Even as Israeli defence officials continued to raise the prospect of a cross-border operation into southern Lebanon, the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the UK voiced alarm over the latest escalation on the Israeli side. Israel must \u201cimmediately stop its strikes in Lebanon\u201d, the French foreign minister, Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, said, adding that his country was opposed to any form of ground operation by the Israelis. David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, said on X that he had spoken to the Lebanese prime minister, Najib Mikati. \u201cWe agreed on the need for an immediate ceasefire to bring an end to the bloodshed. A diplomatic solution is the only way to restore security and stability for the Lebanese and Israeli people,\u201d Lammy wrote. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, told the broadcaster ARD that Nasrallah\u2019s killing \u201cthreatens destabilisation for the whole of Lebanon\u201d, which \u201cis in no way in Israel\u2019s security interest\u201d. The US president, Joe Biden, has described Nasrallah\u2019s death as a \u201cmeasure of justice\u201d, though he also told reporters on Saturday: \u201cIt\u2019s time for a ceasefire.\u201d Since Nasrallah\u2019s death Hezbollah has said it will continue fighting Israel and has continued to fire rockets at it, including a salvo on Sunday morning. More than 700 people have been killed in Lebanon since Israel stepped up its bombardment of Hezbollah strongholds last Monday, according to health ministry figures. In Beirut, displaced families spent the night on benches at Zaitunay Bay, a string of restaurants and cafes on Beirut\u2019s waterfront where private security usually shoos away any loiterers. The UN refugee chief, Filippo Grandi, said \u201cwell over 200,000 people are displaced inside Lebanon\u201d and more than 50,000 had fled to neighbouring Syria. Nasrallah was killed in a massive Israeli air attack on Friday on Hezbollah\u2019s headquarters in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. It was a major blow to the group and to Iran, removing an influential ally who helped build Hezbollah into the linchpin of Tehran\u2019s network of allied groups in the Arab world. Israel announced his killing on Saturday and Hezbollah later confirmed his death. The growing international concern over the potential impact of Nasrallah\u2019s assassination came as Israel continued to launch dozens of strikes against Hezbollah. According to reports, one air raid in northern Lebanon on Sunday morning killed 11 people. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the military had endorsed a potential ground operation. It cited army officials as saying they had gained substantial experience in Gaza and that Israeli intelligence on Lebanon was much better than what it had had on Hamas in Gaza. Reports in the Israeli media suggested that the leadership of the Israel Defense Forces was continuing to push for a limited ground offensive within weeks, seeing a closing window of opportunity. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Saturday that Nasrallah\u2019s killing was a necessary step toward \u201cchanging the balance of power in the region for years to come\u201d. \u201cNasrallah was not a terrorist, he was the terrorist,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement, warning of challenging days ahead. The Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said: \u201cHis elimination makes the world a safer place.\u201d Hezbollah began low-intensity cross-border strikes on Israeli troops a day after its Palestinian ally Hamas staged its unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October, triggering the war in Gaza. The Israeli military said on Sunday that it had killed Nabil Kaouk, another top Hezbollah leader, on Saturday. Kaouk was one of the few remaining senior members of the organisation, and reportedly one of those being considered to succeed Nasrallah as leader. Analysts suggest that Hashem Safieddine, the head of Hezbollah\u2019s executive council, is the favoured pick to succeed Nasrallah. Naeem Qassem, the deputy secretary general of the organisation, is also reportedly in the running. Hezbollah\u2019s leadership has been decimated by a relentless Israeli assassination campaign."

            "title": "Lebanon ceasefire hopes fade as Netanyahu issues contradictory statements",
            "date": "2024-09-27T12:02:12Z",
            "content": "Optimism that a three-week ceasefire could be reached between Hezbollah and Israel appeared to recede as Benjamin Netanyahu issued a pair of contradictory statements on the proposal within hours of each other, as fresh Israeli strikes on Lebanon in the early hours of Friday killed 25 people. In the latest statement from Netanyahu\u2019s office, issued overnight on Friday, the Israeli prime minister chided reporting on the issue as he confirmed Israel had been consulted regarding a US-led ceasefire proposal. \u201cIsrael shares the aims of the US-led initiative of enabling people along our northern border to return safely and securely to their homes. Israel appreciates the US efforts in this regard because the US role is indispensable in advancing stability and security in the region,\u201d the statement read. A previous release earlier on Thursday, however, had said that reporting \u201cabout a ceasefire is incorrect. This is an American-French proposal that the prime minister has not even responded to.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s twin statements appeared to replicate his response to previous US-led diplomatic initiatives over a Gaza ceasefire, where Israel has suggested it is more open to talks in private before reversing in the face of opposition from his coalition members. Not for the first time US officials appear to have been wrongfooted by Netanyahu, saying initially they had believed his government was \u201conboard\u201d with the plan for a 21-day ceasefire when it was announced by the US, France and other allies, saying the proposal had been \u201ccoordinated\u201d with Israel. \u201cWe had every reason to believe that in the drafting of it and in the delivery of it, that the Israelis were fully informed and fully aware of every word in it,\u201d John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, told reporters on Thursday, adding that the US \u201cwouldn\u2019t have done it if we didn\u2019t believe that it would be received with the seriousness with which it was composed\u201d. The late-night statement came after Abdallah Bou Habib, Lebanon\u2019s foreign minister, urged all parties to implement the proposal, saying the escalating violence threatened his country\u2019s \u201cvery existence\u201d. Speaking at the UN general assembly in New York, Bou Habib said the US-French ceasefire proposal was an \u201copportunity to generate momentum, to take steps towards ending this crisis\u201d. Earlier, the office of Netanyahu \u2013 who is addressing the UN general assembly on Friday \u2013 said the IDF would \u201ccontinue fighting with full force\u201d to achieve its war goals. Those war goals include the safe return home of more than 60,000 Israelis forced to abandon their homes in northern Israel by Hezbollah bombing, which began on 8 October last year, the day after the start of the Gaza war. The International Organization for Migration estimated that more than 200,000 people have been displaced in Lebanon since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in October in support of Hamas. According to officials in Lebanon, 25 people have been killed in Israeli strikes on Lebanon since the early hours of Friday, including a family of nine in the Lebanese border town of Chebaa after a missile destroyed their three-storey building. On Thursday, Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said nearly 700 people had been killed this week, as Israel dramatically escalated strikes it says are targeting Hezbollah\u2019s military capacities. According to health authorities, a total of 1,540 people have been killed within its borders since 7 October. The IDF said a strike on a southern suburb of Beirut killed the head of Hezbollah\u2019s drone force, Mohammad Surur. Israel has carried out several strikes in Beirut this week, targeting senior Hezbollah commanders. The UN refugee agency says \u201cwell over 30,000\u201d people have crossed from Lebanon into neighbouring Syria over the past 72 hours in the wake of fighting between Hezbollah and Israeli forces in Lebanon. Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, the representative for the refugee agency UNHCR in Syria, said roughly half of the people who have fled were children and adolescents. He said about 80% were Syrians returning to their home country and the rest were Lebanese. \u201cNow these, of course, are people who are fleeing bombs and who are crossing into a country that has been suffering from its own crisis and violence for 13 years now,\u201d he told reporters in Geneva by video from the Lebanon-Syria border. Syria is facing \u201ceconomic collapse\u201d, he said. \u201cI think that this just illustrates the kind of extremely difficult choices both Syrians and Lebanese are having to make,\u201d he said. After the Beirut explosion, dozens of rockets were fired toward the northern Israeli city of Safed, with one hitting a street in a nearby town. In total, 175 projectiles were fired from Lebanon on Thursday, the military said. Most were intercepted or fell in open areas, some sparking wildfires. The IDF said on Friday it had intercepted a missile fired from Yemen that set off air raid sirens across Israel\u2019s populous central area, including Tel Aviv. Another missile from Yemen landed in central Israel about two weeks ago. The strikes came after Israel\u2019s military chief said on Wednesday the country was preparing for a possible ground operation in Lebanon. On Thursday, the Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee reiterated that the military was preparing for a ground operation while awaiting a decision on whether to go ahead, and that the air force had reduced Hezbollah\u2019s weapons stockpile and was working to prevent the transfer of further arms from Iran. Hezbollah has yet to respond to the call for a truce, although it and its backer Iran have previously said it would halt its strikes only if there is a ceasefire in Gaza. Emmanuel Macron \u2013 who was a co-backer with Joe Biden of the 21-day ceasefire proposal \u2013 said Netanyahu would have to take responsibility for a regional escalation if he did not agree to the truce. \u201cThe proposal that was made is a solid proposal,\u201d the French president said, adding that the plan supported by the US and the EU had been prepared with Netanyahu himself. The domestic political repercussions of a ceasefire for Netanyahu were made clear when his national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, told the prime minister that his party, Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power), would not vote with the coalition if the government agreed a ceasefire with Hezbollah. \u201cWe will not abandon the residents of the north. Every day that this ceasefire is in effect and Israel does not fight in the north, Otzma Yehudit is not committed to the coalition,\u201d Ben-Gvir said at a party meeting. The leader of the opposition Democrats party, Yair Golan, also argued against committing to a three-week ceasefire, saying Israel should initially agree to a truce of a few days to see how well it was enforced."

Israel has rejected a US-French proposal for a 21-day truce with Hezbollah to allow for comprehensive talks, after three days of Israeli bombing that killed more than 600 people in Lebanon. Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office ruled it out, saying: \u201cThe news about a ceasefire \u2013 not true. This is an American-French proposal, to which the prime minister did not even respond.\u201d It came after the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, warned \u201chell is breaking loose\u201d in Lebanon and Israel\u2019s top general said it was preparing for a possible ground incursion into the country, intensifying fears of a regional war.

The exchange of fire since October 7th, and in particular over the past two weeks, threatens a much broader conflict, and harm to civilians.\u201d Why does the US not call for an immediate ceasefire?

This would make him the first sitting New York City mayor to be criminally charged.

            "date": "2024-09-27T21:12:23Z",
            "content": "Benjamin Netanyahu shrugged off global appeals for a ceasefire in a defiant speech to the United Nations that was delivered barely an hour before massive airstrikes targeting Hezbollah\u2019s leader levelled several apartment blocks in Beirut. Addressing the general assembly in New York, Israel\u2019s prime minister presented his country as a champion of peace and prosperity for the Middle East, even as its security forces prepared an attack that spread terror in the streets of the Lebanese capital and heightened fears of an all-out regional war. \u201cIsrael seeks peace. Israel yearns for peace. Israel has made peace and will make peace again,\u201d he said, but made no mention of the ceasefire deals for Gaza and Lebanon that have been championed by the US. Instead he threatened more attacks in a campaign against Hezbollah that began last week with exploding pagers, and this week expanded to airstrikes that have killed more than 700 people and displaced at least 90,000. \u201cWe will continue degrading Hezbollah,\u201d he told a half-empty hall. Many national delegations had walked out in protest when Netanyahu took the podium. It was a clear retreat from plans for a 21-day ceasefire across the Lebanese border that had been backed by the US and France and drawn up in close collaboration with the Israeli government. Soon after he finished speaking, huge explosions ripped through southern Beirut, reducing six buildings to rubble, reportedly in an attempt to assassinate Hezbollah\u2019s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, by taking out an underground bunker. Netanyahu\u2019s office said he would fly home immediately, breaking a usual rule against travel on the Jewish Sabbath. It released a photo of the prime minister ordering the strike, apparently from a landline in a makeshift command centre in New York. World leaders gathered in New York for the UN general assembly this week repeatedly used their moment in the global spotlight to plead for a halt to the war in Gaza and across the Lebanese border. Before Israel was given the podium on Friday morning, the Slovenian prime minister, Robert Golob, demanded: \u201cMr Netanyahu, stop this war now,\u201d and Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, described attacks in Gaza as \u201cthe systematic slaughter of innocent people\u201d. Netanyahu responded by denouncing the UN as an \u201cantisemitic swamp\u201d, and insisted that Israel was committed to military victory. \u201cWe are winning,\u201d he said, adding that since the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October, Israel had shown that \u201cif you strike us, we will strike you\u201d. Netanyahu said the campaign against Hezbollah would continue until Israelis could return to their homes in the north of the country, and the war in Gaza would stop only when Israel claimed \u201ctotal victory\u201d or Hamas laid down its arms. The Biden administration clearly thought it had brokered the outline of an agreement to halt the conflict in Lebanon earlier this week, and was angry about Netanyahu\u2019s last-minute decision to back away from that plan. Washington is Israel\u2019s most important ally, offering diplomatic protection in the UN as a permanent member of the security council and critical weapons for the military, but has struggled to leverage that support into influence over Netanyahu\u2019s political decisions. The US national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said pointedly that a statement about a 21-day pause \u201cwasn\u2019t just drawn up in a vacuum. It was done after careful consultation, not only with the countries that signed on to it, but Israel itself.\u201d Netanyahu said Israel was fighting an existential \u201cseven-front\u201d war against Hamas and its allies, from the Houthis in Yemen, to militias in Iraq and Syria, militants in the occupied West Bank and Hezbollah in Lebanon. \u201cMy country is at war, fighting for its life,\u201d he said, adding that he had left Jerusalem reluctantly, to \u201cset the record straight\u201d in New York. Nearly a year into a war that has reshaped politics in the region, his speech defiantly ignored those profound shifts. He called for a \u201chistoric peace agreement\u201d with Saudi Arabia, something that was on the table a year ago with strong backing from Washington. Now, though, Riyadh has ruled out normalisation without the recognition of a Palestinian state, and its delegation did not hear Netanyahu\u2019s proposal because they had left the room. He also urged global action to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. This has been a long-term US preoccupation, but frantic efforts to stave off a full-blown conventional conflict with Iran have forced nuclear concerns down the diplomatic agenda. He ended with an awkward adaptation of two lines from the Welsh writer Dylan Thomas\u2019 poem about confronting mortality, Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night, using them to insist that Israel would outlast its enemies. \u201cTo paraphrase a great poet: Israel will not go gentle into that good night, we will never need to rage against the dying of the light, because the torch of Israel will forever shine bright,\u201d Netanyahu said."

            "content": "Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel \u201cwill not stop\u201d its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon despite calls from the US, France and other allies for an immediate three-week ceasefire aimed at containing the spread of a conflict that is beginning to engulf Lebanon. The calls for an immediate ceasefire were backed on Thursday night by Lebanon\u2019s minister for foreign affairs, Abdallah Bouhabib, who told the UN general assembly his country was enduring a crisis that \u201cthreatens its very existence\u201d. Bouhabib welcomed the US/French initiative, saying \u201cDiplomacy is not always easy, but diplomacy is the only way to save innocent lives \u2026 Lebanon views the US-French initiative as an opportunity to generate momentum, to take steps towards ending this crisis.\u201d Bouhabib said peace was incumbent on Israel\u2019s government, and that there can be no lasting peace without a \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d. Israeli airstrikes continued in Lebanon on Thursday, killing 92 people including the head of Hezbollah\u2019s drone force, Mohammad Surur, and at least 150 rockets were fired from Lebanon at northern Israel, according to the Israeli military. The Israeli prime minister told reporters that his government\u2019s policy was clear as he landed in New York, where he is due to address the UN general assembly on Friday. \u201cWe are continuing to strike Hezbollah with full force, and we will not stop until we reach all our goals \u2013 chief among them the return of the residents of the north securely to their homes,\u201d Netanyahu said. His office had earlier distanced the Israeli government from the ceasefire plan, which it described as \u201can American-French proposal that the prime minister has not even responded to\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s office said Netanyahu had \u201cdirected the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to continue fighting with full force, according to the plan that was presented to him. The fighting in Gaza will also continue until all the objectives of the war have been achieved.\u201d Those war goals include the safe return home of more than 60,000 Israelis forced to abandon their homes in northern Israel by Hezbollah bombing, which began on 8 October last year, the day after the start of the Gaza war. US officials hope to persuade Netanyahu to accept the ceasefire proposal by the time he addresses the UN general assembly on Friday. They argue that a pause in the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah could also provide a breathing space in which to revive long-stalled negotiations with Israel and Hamas over the release of Israeli hostages in return for a truce in Gaza. On Thursday, the White House said the Biden administration had believed that Israel was \u201con board\u201d with the proposal. John Kirby, the White House\u2019s national security spokesperson, said \u201cwe had every reason to believe that in the drafting of it and in the delivery of it, that the Israelis were fully informed and fully aware of every word in it. We wouldn\u2019t have done it if we didn\u2019t believe that it would be received with the seriousness with which it was composed.\u201d Kirby said it was unclear why Netanyahu appeared to dismiss the idea. The US, France and some of their allies had on Wednesday called for an urgent cessation of hostilities, which they said presented \u201can unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation\u201d. \u201cWe call for an immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy,\u201d a joint statement said. \u201cWe call on all parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary ceasefire immediately.\u201d The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Thursday that it would be \u201ca mistake\u201d for Netanyahu to refuse a ceasefire in Lebanon, which he warned could not become \u201canother Gaza\u201d. Hezbollah has yet to respond to the call for a truce, although it and its backer, Iran, have previously insisted it would halt its strikes only if there is a ceasefire in Gaza, while the Israeli response has been overwhelmingly negative. After Netanyahu\u2019s remarks, the defence minister said he had met the country\u2019s top generals to discuss further military operations on the Israel\u2019s northern front. \u201cWe are continuing our sequence of operations \u2013 eliminating Hezbollah terrorists, dismantling Hezbollah\u2019s offensive infrastructure and destroying rockets and missiles,\u201d Yoav Gallant said. \u201cWe have additional missions to complete in order to ensure the safe return of Israel\u2019s northern communities to their homes. We will continue throwing Hezbollah off balance and deepening their loss.\u201d US officials have urged Israel to accept a ceasefire on the grounds that it could lead to a negotiated withdrawal of Hezbollah forces from the border area, from where they have been firing rockets and missiles at Israel. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has argued that diplomacy is the best way to create conditions to allow residents to return to their homes. \u201cGetting into a full-scale war is not the way to achieve that objective,\u201d he told the US TV channel MSNBC. \u201cThere\u2019s no way in that situation that people are going to be able to go back.\u201d But western diplomats gathered in New York for the UN general assembly expressed doubt that Netanyahu would agree to such a deal, despite his long history of juggling contrary demands from the US and the extreme right in his cabinet. Meanwhile, efforts by the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, and foreign secretary, David Lammy, to secure a New York meeting with either Netanyahu or his strategic affairs minister, Ron Dermer, did not bear fruit, possibly reflecting Israel\u2019s unhappiness over the UK\u2019s limited ban on arms exports. The families of the Gaza hostages have also said they are pushing for any Lebanon ceasefire deal to include clauses on Gaza, focused on securing the release of the roughly 70 hostages thought to still be alive and the bodies of about 30 others. An Israeli airstrike in Gaza on Thursday hit a school sheltering thousands of displaced Palestinians, killing at least 11 people and wounding 22, including women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry. The Israeli military confirmed it had struck the school, in the Jabalia refugee camp, but claimed the attack had been aimed at Hamas militants hiding there. Hezbollah has said that it will continue fighting Israel as long as the IDF keeps up its military operations in Gaza, but the ranks of the Iran-backed Shia militia have been shattered over the past nine days by a coordinated attack using booby-trapped communications devices, followed by a withering aerial bombing campaign. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said 19 Syrian refugees and a Lebanese citizen had been killed in one strike in north-east Lebanon on Thursday, bringing the death toll from several days of Israeli bombardment to about 700 people, about a quarter of whom the ministry said were women or children. The UK was one of the allies that backed the US-French call for a 21-day ceasefire. \u201cI urge President Netanyahu and the Lebanese Hezbollah leaders to pay heed to the combined voices at the United Nations to do just that,\u201d the British defence secretary said after a meeting with his US and Australian counterparts in London. John Healey said 700 British troops had been sent to Cyprus to help a potential emergency evacuation of civilians from Lebanon should a full-scale war break out. The domestic political repercussions of a ceasefire for Netanyahu were made clear when his national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, told the prime minister that his party, Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power), would not vote with the coalition if the government agreed a ceasefire with Hezbollah. \u201cWe will not abandon the residents of the north. Every day that this ceasefire is in effect and Israel does not fight in the north, Otzma Yehudit is not committed to the coalition,\u201d Ben-Gvir said at a party meeting. The leader of the opposition Democrats party, Yair Golan, also argued against committing to a three-week ceasefire, saying Israel should initially agree to a truce of a few days, and see how well it was enforced. Israel has said it is prepared to launch a ground incursion into Lebanon alongside its aerial bombing, and on Thursday the IDF announced its troops had completed training drills near the northern border, simulating combat in Lebanon. The IDF called up two reserve brigades at short notice on Wednesday to deploy to the northern border, where they will join Israel\u2019s 98th Paratrooper Division, which was put under the control of the northern command last week. However, Haaretz described this as \u201ca relatively limited reserve call-up\u201d. The Israeli newspaper said that after the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel, in the run-up to the ground invasion of Gaza, \u201chundreds of thousands of reservists were called up, as were several divisions\u201d. Haaretz\u2019s military correspondent, Amos Harel, argued that an Israeli invasion of Lebanon \u201cis still not a done deal\u201d."

            "content": "Good morning. US officials unsealed criminal charges against Hamas\u2019 top leaders over their roles in planning, supporting and perpetrating the 7 October attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people, including more than 40 Americans. The announcement of the charges yesterday came as the US state department said it was \u201ctime to finalize a deal\u201d that would end the conflict that has killed more than 40,800 Palestinians and laid waste to much of the territory. Unprecedented protests \u2013 and a general strike on Monday \u2013 have erupted throughout Israel over the past few days in favor of a deal over the discovery of six murdered hostages in Gaza, one of whom was Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a 23-year-old Israeli-American. \u201cWe are investigating Hersh\u2019s murder, and each and every one of Hamas\u2019s brutal murders of Americans, as an act of terrorism,\u201d said the US attorney general, Merrick Garland. Who is named in the complaint? The complaint names six defendants, three of whom are dead. The living defendants are Yahya Sinwar, the militant group\u2019s chief, who is believed to be in hiding in Gaza; Khaled Meshaal, who is based in Doha and heads the group\u2019s diaspora office; and Ali Baraka, a senior Hamas official based in Lebanon. The deceased defendants are the former Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in July in Tehran; the military wing chief Mohammed Deif, who Israel said it killed in a July airstrike; and Marwan Issa, a deputy military commander, who Israel said it killed in a March strike. What does the complaint say? The complaint describes the massacre as the \u201cmost violent, large-scale terrorist attack\u201d in Hamas\u2019s history, detailing how Hamas operatives arrived in southern Israel with \u201ctrucks, motorcycles, bulldozers, speedboats, and paragliders\u201d to engage in a brutal campaign of violence that included rape, genital mutilation and machine-gun shootings at close range. What has Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s stance been on ending the war? Netanyahu gave a televised address in response, during which he ruled out making any \u201cconcessions\u201d in the stalled talks or \u201cgiving in to pressure\u201d to end the war. His main political rival, Benny Gantz, has accused the Israeli prime minister of putting his personal interests before those of his country. Zelenskiy reshuffles Ukraine cabinet As Russia continued its relentless air barrage, killing seven in a missile attack in Lviv, Volodymyr Zelenskiy carried out the biggest government shake-up since start of the war in Ukraine, with his foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, resigning along with several other ministers and a presidential aide dismissed. Zelenskiy said this wide-ranging government reshuffle was meant to provide \u201cnew strength\u201d to the embattled country. Who else has resigned? Among other key ministers who are reported to have submitted resignations are Olha Stefanishyna, the deputy prime minister in charge of leading Ukraine\u2019s push to join the EU, and Oleksandr Kamyshin, the minister for strategic industries, who oversees arms production and development. What is the reason for this reshuffle? The reshuffle has been portrayed as a political \u201creset\u201d engineered by Zelenskiy and his close circle. Speaking in a video address on Tuesday evening, the president said he was refreshing his team before an \u201cextremely important autumn\u201d. He promised a \u201cslightly different emphasis\u201d in foreign and domestic policy. In other news \u2026 A former aide to the New York governors Andrew Cuomo and Kathy Hochul was charged on Tuesday with acting as an undisclosed agent of the Chinese government, with federal prosecutors alleging that she blocked representatives of the Taiwanese government from having access to the governor\u2019s office. The Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg has been arrested in Copenhagen at a protest against the war in Gaza. \u201cGigantic\u201d landslides are threatening a California coastal town, where the governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency, prompting officials to cut power to hundreds of homes. A teenager in San Francisco has been charged with five offenses for allegedly shooting the San Francisco 49ers player Ricky Pearsall during a robbery attempt in the city\u2019s shopping district. \u201cScamanda\u201d \u2013 the US woman who earned the derisive nickname by faking a prolonged fight with terminal cancer \u2013 may have Munchausen syndrome, a psychological disorder that involves feigning illness to win others\u2019 nurturing, prosecutors said. Stat of the day: At least 280m birds have died worldwide from a highly infectious H5N1 strain of avian flu A highly infectious H5N1 strain of avian flu has devastated poultry and caused the biggest sudden drop of the world\u2019s wild bird population in decades. Of the millions of wild birds that have died since October 2021, tens of thousands have been from endangered and endemic species. Australia and New Zealand remain the only countries still free of outbreaks among wild birds. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible for me to predict what\u2019s going to flare up where,\u201d said Prof Ashley Banyard, a virologist at the UK\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Agency laboratory in Surrey, UK. Don\u2019t miss this: The drug gangsters turned podcasters In Rio de Janeiro, a group of former drug gangsters who have collectively spent decades in jail have turned to podcasting as a way to stop younger generations from following the same law-breaking path. Each week, they talk to ex-offenders about how they embraced a life of crime, painting a wretched portrait of Rio\u2019s seemingly inexorable slide into one of the world\u2019s most deadly urban conflicts. \u201cWe want to teach young people that crime doesn\u2019t pay,\u201d said Alexander Mendes, 50, a former drug boss who was one of Rio\u2019s most wanted men until his arrest in Paraguay in 2011. \u2026 or this: how a natural gas project is upending residents\u2019 lives Since 2021, when Venture Global began construction on what will become one of the world\u2019s largest liquefied natural gas hubs along the Gulf coast, residents of Plaquemines parish, 70 miles south of New Orleans, say they have faced unreliable essential services, water shortages and impassible traffic. Venture Global has received permits to have up to 6,000 workers on-site at any one time, but the local sheriff\u2019s office said up to 12,000 workers entered the parish each day, equivalent to about half of Plaquemines parish\u2019s population, putting a strain on local resources including water, road space and emergency services. Climate check: The children behind South Korea\u2019s important climate win Last week, youth activists in South Korea won an important victory after the constitutional court ruled that parts of the country\u2019s climate law was unconstitutional for failing to protect the rights of future generations. But to campaigners, this is just the beginning. \u201cUntil now, Korea has responded to the climate crisis as if achieving targets alone was a success,\u201d said Hyunjung Yoon, 19, who joined the youth climate litigation team when she was 15. \u201cThe government never considered how the risks are actually growing or how people\u2019s lives are affected. We need to focus on safeguarding our rights, not just hitting numbers.\u201d Last Thing: The nope baby We have all heard about the nepo baby, the term du jour for the children of famous, wealthy and well-connected parents.

From Claudia Conway \u2013 the daughter of Kellyanne Conway, a former senior counselor to Donald Trump, who posted TikToks and tweets expressing her anti-Trump political views and airing out her mom\u2019s dirty laundry \u2013 to Vivian Jenna Wilson, who is retaliating against her father, Elon Musk, after he said he considered her dead after she came out as transgender and transitioned \u2013 the nope baby is unafraid to bite the hand that feeds them.

            "date": "2024-09-26T17:56:12Z",
            "content": "Wifi networks at a number of train stations across the UK have been suspended after a \u201ccybersecurity incident\u201d. Nineteen stations including London Euston, Manchester Piccadilly and Birmingham New Street had their wifi services suspended on Wednesday night after the incident. They were still down on Thursday. The Manchester Evening News reported that passengers accessing the wifi at Piccadilly station were directed to a webpage titled \u201cWe love you, Europe\u201d, which contained Islamophobic messages and details of several terrorist attacks that have taken place in the UK and in Europe. A Network Rail spokesperson said: \u201cWe are currently dealing with a cybersecurity incident affecting the public wifi at Network Rail\u2019s managed stations. This service is provided via a third party and has been suspended while an investigation is under way.\u201d A British Transport Police spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of a cyber-attack that affected some Network Rail wifi services, reported to us at around 5.03pm today [25 September]. We are working with Network Rail to investigate the incident.\u201d Telent, the company that provides wifi services for Network Rail, said the \u201cunauthorised change\u201d to the wifi landing page had been made from a \u201clegitimate administrator account\u201d and that the matter was now under criminal investigation. The firm said it was working with Global Reach, the firm that provided the page, to investigate and that none of its other customers, which include Openreach, Transport for London (TfL), National Highways, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the NHS Ambulance Radio Programme, had been affected. \u201cFollowing the incident affecting the public wifi at Network Rail\u2019s managed stations, Telent have been working with Network Rail and other stakeholders,\u201d Telent said. \u201cThrough investigations with Global Reach \u2026 it has been identified that an unauthorised change was made to the Network Rail landing page from a legitimate Global Reach administrator account and the matter is now subject to criminal investigations by the British Transport Police. \u201cNo personal data has been affected. As a precaution, Telent temporarily suspended all use of Global Reach services while verifying that no other Telent customers were impacted.\u201d Later on Thursday, the BTP said a man who was employed by Global Reach had been arrested under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and offences under the Malicious Communications Act 1988. In London, 10 major train stations have been affected: King\u2019s Cross, London Bridge, Euston, Victoria, Cannon Street, Charing Cross, Liverpool Street, Clapham Junction, Waterloo and Paddington. Manchester Piccadilly, Liverpool Lime Street, Birmingham New Street, Glasgow Central, Leeds City, Bristol Temple Meads, Edinburgh Waverley, Reading and Guildford stations were also affected. Earlier this month, TfL was hit by a cyber-attack that potentially breached thousands of customers\u2019 details. While services ran as normal, the company restricted access to live travel data that served travel apps such as Citymapper and TfL Go, and other customer services including those relating to journey history and photocard registration as it dealt with the breach. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said a 17-year-old boy from Walsall had been detained on suspicion of offences under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 in relation to the attack on TfL\u2019s systems. The teenager was released on bail after questioning by NCA officers. TfL said it was contacting about 5,000 customers as a precaution to warn that their email and bank account details could have been accessed. It is understood to relate to those who had applied for refunds on journeys made using Oyster cards. On Monday, TfL aid there was no date set for when passenger journey and live travel data would be accessible again. It added: \u201cWe can assure customers that once it is available they will be able to see their full journey history and correct any incomplete journeys or maximum fares.\u201d"

            "title": "Denial, terror and bravado in Beirut as residents await next Israeli air attack",
            "date": "2024-09-30T04:00:03Z",
            "content": "For months, the staff at Rafik Hariri university hospital had been preparing for the worst. Nurses ran drills in parking garages, practising transferring patients from the wards to the bombproof concrete structures. A building was left empty on the hospital campus so that if mass bombing occurred, medics could bring their families with them and not worry about their safety. On Friday night, the drills seemed to pay off. Dozens of bombs were dropped on Dahiya, the southern suburbs of Beirut, sending residents running to the safest place they could think of \u2013 the nearby hospital. People ran to the gates of Rafik Hariri hospital, asking to stay in the car park until the bombing ceased. Staff could not let them in because they had to keep the way clear for incoming wounded and were expecting hundreds of casualties from the airstrikes, which killed the head of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, and levelled a city block. The residents settled for waiting outside the hospital gates, staying as close to the structure as possible until the Israeli bombing of Dahiya slowed in the morning. Once the displaced left, the wounded started coming in. Hospitals in Dahiya transferred patients to Rafik Hariri and other surrounding medical centres after the ministry of health ordered the evacuation of all hospitals in the southern suburbs. Contrary to expectations, the wounded from Friday\u2019s strike on Dahiya came at a trickle, the health ministry reporting 11 dead and 108 wounded in its latest update. The deep craters where six buildings used to stand, a result of the powerful bunker bombs Israel had dropped, made search and rescue difficult. Lebanon\u2019s first responders, who had grown used to sifting through rubble over the last 12 months of fighting, found themselves combing through destruction the likes of which they had never seen before. Two days after the strike, the death toll continued to steadily climb. The hospital system had successfully passed its latest crisis, nurses and doctors exhausted after two weeks of non-stop mass casualty events. No one, however, was optimistic, bracing themselves for further escalation, including the possibility of an Israeli ground invasion. \u201cWe\u2019re facing a big psychological challenge. We\u2019re are scared that the basic supplies will be cut off. I\u2019m scared that if the situation continues, we will be cut off from everything,\u201d Shoshana Mazraani, the emergency room director of Marjayoun public hospital in south Lebanon, said. Those fears were multiplied when Israel continued to escalate its aerial campaign across wide swathes of the country. On Saturday in Shebaa, a town on the Lebanon-Israel border, residents\u2019 phones began to ring. An Israeli official on the line told them to evacuate their homes immediately, as they soon would be struck. \u201cThey told us which road to take; they even called the police. Everyone was frightened and fled. Just 10 minutes after the calls started, they started to bomb the town,\u201d Mohammed Saab, the mayor of the Shebaa, said over the phone. He added that three homes were destroyed by the Israeli strikes. Rumours of people receiving similar calls began to circulate on social media, with people warning each other to stay away from certain areas lest they be bombed. In one case, rumours swirled that residents of a building housing displaced people in the town of Baakline in the mountains of south-east Lebanon had evacuated after receiving a call. One of the building\u2019s residents later said that it was just hearsay and that no one had been called by the Israelis. On the streets of Beirut, Lebanese soldiers stood at intersections mostly devoid of cars. An Israeli drone patrolled overhead, the strengthening and receding of its buzz periodically sending residents to their balconies, where they craned their heads to spot any smoke that would signal a strike. The period of official mourning for Nasrallah\u2019s death did not start until Monday. For some people in the capital, there was a reluctance to believe he had gone. \u201cThey said that they killed Seyed Hassan Nasrallah, which until now 90% of the people don\u2019t believe. This is what the media wants us to hear, this is my thinking,\u201d Amir, a 24-year-old shop owner in Karkoun al-Druze, a mixed-sect neighbourhood in Beirut, said. \u201cIt will just take a little bit of time for him to get back. If he does come back and he\u2019s alive, things will get way worse [for Israel].\u201d About a mile away, as Amir was speaking, media reported that rescue workers had found Nasrallah\u2019s body, lifting his shrouded corpse with a crane. Amir\u2019s neighbour agreed with him that the late leader of Hezbollah, who during his three-decade command of the group achieved mythical status among supporters and enemies alike, was not dead. The group\u2019s announcement of his death was just a ploy to fool the Israelis, who to Amir and his neighbour were verging on hubris by even thinking of a ground invasion. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for them to set a foot in Lebanon. If we\u2019re facing 10 of them, there will be hundred of us,\u201d Amir said, saying that despite the fact that he was Sunni, he supported what he saw as the Shia organisation\u2019s defence of Lebanon against Israel. Even if some Lebanese might face the prospect of an Israeli invasion with bravado, there were doubts as to whether the Lebanese state was prepared for it. \u201cThey said they had been preparing for a year, but look what happened last Friday. No one was expecting it,\u201d Yusuf, who owned a shop next to Amir, said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it will be like 2006 all over again. It was very difficult then: food stocks ran out, supplies were low.\u201d In downtown Beirut, the lack of preparation was evident. Families displaced from Dahiya crowded together under the few trees that dotted a park, shielding themselves from the afternoon sun. The prospect of more fighting, regardless of whether it was missiles fired at or coming from Israel, was a disturbing one for some of those who had lost their homes. Murshid Yusuf\u2019s wife had been killed and his home destroyed in an Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon. \u201cI want the situation to get better. I want everyone to be in their homes sitting with their family,\u201d he said. \u201cI want people to be able to go out and be happy. That\u2019s it.\u201d"

            "title": "Myanmar journalists facing \u2018terror campaign\u2019 in deadliest year for media since coup",
            "date": "2024-09-13T09:50:16Z",
            "content": "Myanmar\u2019s junta has been accused of conducting a campaign of terror against the media after three journalists died in August, making this year the deadliest for the industry since the 2021 coup with more than three months to go. Htet Myat Thu, 28, and Win Htut Oo, 26, both freelance journalists, were shot dead during a raid on their home by the military junta on 21 August in the southern Mon state. In the same week, on 19 August, Pe Maung Sein, 50, an award-winning documentary film-maker, died at a private hospital in Yangon just three days after he had been released from a junta prison. Hours of beatings at an interrogation centre had left him with five broken ribs and four prolapsed discs, which were untreated for almost two years in jail, where he also endured periods without adequate food. His wife says he was left paralysed, and with such severe injuries he was unable to drink, eat or even talk. In total, four journalists have been killed this year, making 2024 the deadliest for members of the press since the military seized power in February 2021, ousting the government of Aung San Suu Kyi. The coup was met by widespread opposition from the public, and an armed uprising against the junta. Journalists documenting the conflict and the frequent human rights abuses by the military, have faced immense dangers. Hundreds of journalists have also been forced to flee into exile or fled to areas controlled by opposing armed groups, while others work underground. Pe Maung Sein was arrested in May 2022 while filming in Loikaw, close to the border with Thailand. He wanted to document the conflict and plight of people forced to flee their homes, his wife, Khin Su Su Htay said. She told the Guardian he was kept at an interrogation centre where his hands and legs were tied, and he was kicked for hours by a group of soldiers, denied food and allowed only a few sips of water. His memories of what happened next were vague as he lost consciousness. The only thing he remembered was pain. He was transferred to Loikaw prison, and charged with communicating with blacklisted organisations. He was denied proper medical treatment for his injuries, relying on medicine that his wife sent from Yangon. When conflict in Loikaw escalated in November 2023, Khin Su was unable to communicate with her husband, but learned he had received very little food as the prison had no regular supplies. He began collapsing from his injuries, and was left paralysed. Pe Maung Sein was moved to Loikaw military hospital in April 2024, before being moved again to Yangon, after a request from Khin Su. Despite being paralysed, his legs were chained to the hospital bed and he was watched over by armed guards. MRI results showed that he had five broken ribs and four prolapsed discs, while an endoscopic test showed he had a lump in his trachea in addition to bone tuberculosis. He was released four days before his sentence was completed and Khin Su rushed him to a private hospital. He died three days later. \u201cI had already prepared for him with a wheelchair. I expected him to return home at least as a disabled person, but not like this,\u201d Khin Su said. The Guardian was not able to reach a military representative for comment. Two days after Pe Maung Sein\u2019s death, freelance journalists Htet Myat Thu and Win Htut Oo were shot dead in the country\u2019s south. On 21 August, Thiri Lwin, the girlfriend of Win Htut Oo, received a phone call telling her that gunshots had been heard near the home that her partner shared with Htet Myat Thu in a small town in Southern Myanmar. Neighbours told her that about 30 military soldiers had raided the house, and both men had been shot. The military reportedly targeted the house after learning members of a local anti-junta group had visited them. Htet Myat Thu was shot dead as he went outside to open the gates, according to eyewitnesses. Win Htut Oo was killed later. It was the first time in post-coup Myanmar that a journalist has been shot dead in their home, according to the advocacy group Reporters Sans Fronti\u00e8res (RSF). Pro-junta Telegram channels have said that the two men were part of the anti-junta group, Kyaikhto Revolution Force, a claim that Thiri, Win Htut Oo\u2019s editor and independent media have contradicted. \u201cThey [soldiers] don\u2019t need to shoot and kill them. They could just arrest them,\u201d Thiri said Chan Chan, an editor who worked closely with Win Htut Oo, said he was hardworking, intelligent and their most prolific freelancer. \u201cIt is very difficult to be a journalist at the moment in Myanmar,\u201d she said, adding the country was in a \u201cdark age\u201d. The deaths in August followed the killing of Myat Thu Tun, also known as Phoe Thiha in January. He was shot dead while in military custody in Myanmar\u2019s western Rakhine State. Local media reported that his body, which showed signs of torture, was found buried at a Rakhine State military camp on 5 February. He had been arrested in 2022. Myanmar is the second-worst jailer of journalists, behind China, with 64 journalists currently detained in prisons that are notorious for torture and grim conditions. Arthur Rochereau, of RSF, said that 2024 had not only seen more journalists killed by Myanmar\u2019s military, but also the harshest sentences since the coup, as the junta has increasingly targeted reporters under terrorism-related charges. \u201cDespite the intensifying crackdown, courageous journalists continue risking their lives to report on the country\u2019s dire situation,\u201d said Rochereau. \u201cNow more than ever, the international community must increase pressure on the regime to end its terror campaign against the press.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 16 September 2024 to correct the spelling of Khin Su Su Htay\u2019s name."

            "content": "UK counter-terrorism police are providing support to the investigation into the death of a Daily Telegraph journalist in Gibraltar. David Knowles died while on holiday on Sunday after what his employers said was believed to be a cardiac arrest. The audio journalist, 32, had joined the Telegraph in 2020 and was behind its Ukraine: The Latest podcast. The Royal Gibraltar police (RGP) said in a statement on Thursday that a policing \u201cmutual aid\u201d request for specialist support had been submitted to UK police, adding: \u201cThere are no specific concerns at this time with regard to the death.\u201d \u201cFollowing the RGP\u2019s mutual aid request, detectives from UK counter terrorism policing have been appointed to provide support to the RGP investigation, due to their existing capability and their experience of dealing with international inquiries,\u201d it added. The coroner in Gibraltar has been informed and a coroner\u2019s investigation is under way, the force also said. Arrangements had been made for a postmortem examination to be conducted on Thursday. A spokesperson for the journalist\u2019s family said: \u201cWe note the statement from the RPG today about David, particularly the assertion that \u2018there are no specific concerns at this time with regard to the death\u2019. We do not wish to say anything further while the authorities continue their investigations and ask that the family\u2019s privacy be respected.\u201d A counter-terrorism policing spokesperson said that a request to UK police had been received from the Royal Gibraltar police to assist with the investigation. \u201cDue to the existing capability and experience of dealing with international inquiries, support to the RGP is being provided by officers from counter-terrorism policing,\u201d they added. \u201cPrimacy for the investigation remains with RGP and any further inquiries in relation to this should be directed to them.\u201d In Gibraltar on Thursday, a routine meeting of an official committee which oversees security and civil contingency decided that there was no reason to raise the terror threat level. The Gibraltar government said that the Gibraltar contingency council (GCC), which was due to meet before the death of Knowles, discussed the wider impact of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, as well as recent terrorist activity in Europe. \u201cThe GCC assessed that there was no change to the current moderate terrorism threat level, with an attack remaining possible but not likely,\u201d according to a statement issued by the Gibraltar government. Tributes were paid to Knowles in parliament earlier on Thursday by the Labour MP and new chair of the justice committee, Andy Slaughter, who called for a debate on the importance of investigative and public interest journalism. Lucy Powell, leader of the House of Commons, joined Slaughter in sending condolences to the journalist\u2019s family. \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely right \u2013 investigative journalism is so important to our democracy, and we should do whatever we can as a country to support it,\u201d she added."

            "date": "2024-09-26T17:37:23Z",
            "content": "Another pandemic as big as the Covid crisis that killed 7 million people worldwide is \u201ca certainty\u201d, Prof Sir Chris Whitty has warned, as he said that the UK\u2019s lack of intensive care capacity for the sickest patients was a \u201cpolitical choice\u201d. The NHS faced an \u201cabsolutely catastrophic situation\u201d when the virus first hit in 2020 but it could have been \u201csubstantially worse\u201d if the UK had not gone into lockdown, England\u2019s chief medical officer said. \u201cWe have to assume a future pandemic on this scale will occur,\u201d he told the public inquiry into Covid-19 on Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s a certainty.\u201d It would also be \u201cfoolish\u201d not to assume that asymptomatic transmission of a deadly virus would happen again, he added. The warning from Whitty came after a doctor repeatedly broke down in tears at the inquiry while describing how the Covid crisis for NHS staff had been like having to respond to a \u201cterrorist attack every day\u201d, with infected patients \u201craining from the sky\u201d. Prof Kevin Fong \u2013 a former clinical adviser in emergency preparedness, resilience and response at NHS England who was on shift during the 7/7 London bombings \u2013 said the scale of deaths in hospitals at the height of the pandemic had been \u201ctruly astounding\u201d. Some intensive care units in England had been so overwhelmed that staff had had to put dead bodies in clear plastic refuse sacks after running out of body bags, and then immediately put another Covid patient in that person\u2019s bed, Fong said. Giving evidence after Fong, Whitty said expanding the capacity of the NHS could help it cope better with a surge in sick patients in future. \u201cTaking ICU [intensive care units] in particular, the UK has a very low ICU capacity compared to most of our peer nations in high-income countries,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, that\u2019s a choice, that\u2019s a political choice. \u201cIt\u2019s a system configuration choice, but it is a choice. Therefore you have less reserve when a major emergency happens, even if it\u2019s short of something of the scale of Covid.\u201d Whitty said resolving the NHS workforce crisis was also crucial. Healthcare systems could not be \u201cscaled up\u201d in a future pandemic without \u201ctrained people\u201d, he added. \u201cYou can buy beds, you can buy space, you can even put in oxygen and things \u2026 But fundamentally, the limit to that system, as to any system, is trained people, and there is no way you can train someone in six weeks to have the experience of an experienced ICU nurse or an experienced ICU doctor. It is simply not possible. \u201cSo if you don\u2019t have it going into the emergency \u2013 if it\u2019s an emergency of this speed of onset \u2013 you should not have any illusions you\u2019re going to have it as you hit the peak.\u201d Among his other recommendations, Whitty said being able to conduct lightning-fast scientific research and reducing health inequalities deserved the most focus. \u201cIf we\u2019re not serious about trying to tackle health inequalities between pandemics, there is no way you\u2019re going to be able to do it when the pandemics occur,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest one that I think deserves slightly more emphasis is having the mechanism to be able to do research very, very fast.\u201d Referring to the development of vaccines and treatments, he added: \u201cI think people always, at the beginning of pandemics, underestimate that it\u2019s actually the science that\u2019s going to get them out of the hole, not all the other things. The other things are holding the line until the science does the work.\u201d Whitty said that, as well as direct harms from Covid such as deaths and long Covid, there were indirect harms \u201cthat come from the system being overwhelmed or at least unable to cope \u2026 all diseases, not just Covid, having higher mortality rates than they would have had\u201d. He admitted that messaging around what masks NHS staff should wear to protect themselves against Covid had been \u201cquite confused\u201d early in the pandemic. He also said officials \u201cdidn\u2019t get it across well enough\u201d that the public should continue to go to hospital for serious illnesses other than Covid. There was never going to be \u201cperfect balance\u201d when it came to stay-at-home messaging, he said. \u201cWe tried \u2026 we tweeted, we talked over the podium and so on. Whether we pushed too strongly on the messages the risks of Covid, I think that\u2019s a much harder one, actually.\u201d Whitty said he still worried today about whether the government got \u201cthe level of concern right\u201d about the dangers of Covid in 2020. \u201cWere we either overpitching it so that people were incredibly afraid of something where in fact, their actuarial risk was low, or were we not pitching it enough and therefore people didn\u2019t realise the risk they were walking into? \u201cI think that balance is really hard, and arguably some people would say we \u2013 if anything \u2013 we overdid it, rather than under, in the beginning.\u201d In a statement, Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, which represents thousands of people, said the scenes described in intensive care units \u201cwere not inevitable, can never be considered acceptable, and must never be repeated\u201d."

            "date": "2024-09-19T08:50:33Z",
            "content": "There are now more than 27 million people calling Australia home \u2013 a quick jump of 1 million people in less than two years thanks to post-pandemic overseas migration. The national population grew by 2.3% to 27.1 million in the year ending 31 March, according to new data released by the Australia Bureau of Statistics on Thursday. Since 2007, it has grown on average by a million about every two-and-three-quarter years. The 27 million milestone took just one-and-three-quarter years, which Phil Browning, the ABS demography director, said was \u201cfar quicker than the average\u201d. It was also quicker than population growth for the previous milestone of 25 million to 26 million, which took just shy of four years, from September 2018 to June 2022. This plateau is attributable to Covid-era lockdowns. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email When the border opened post-pandemic, net overseas migration increased in \u201cfairly large numbers,\u201d Browning said. Overseas migration made up 83% of the past year\u2019s population growth. Net overseas migration \u2013 counting both people who have entered and left Australia \u2013 was 509,800 people. Students made up a \u201csizeable chunk\u201d of that, Browning said. \u201cThat\u2019s down from a peak of 559,900 in September 2023 \u2026 but it\u2019s still high,\u201d he said. Annual natural increase \u2013 counting both births and deaths \u2013 was 105,500 people. \u201cNatural increase is not moving a whole lot, and overseas migration is the significant driver,\u201d Browning said. The total fertility rate sits at about 1.6 births per woman, which Browning described as \u201chistorically, fairly low\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if that will continue or not, but it doesn\u2019t show any signs of going up or down at the moment.\u201d Every state and territory had positive population growth. Western Australian had the largest, at 3.1%, and Tasmania the lowest, at 0.4%. The next milestone of 28 million is projected for 2027. The ABS has predicted Australia\u2019s population could hit 30 million by the year 2033."

            "date": "2024-09-17T20:16:16Z",
            "content": "The UK can expect a \u201ctsunami of missed cancers\u201d, leading experts have said, after an international study found that diagnoses fell sharply during the pandemic. Preliminary figures from the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership, presented to delegates at the World Cancer Congress in Geneva, compared data on the instance and stage of cancer diagnosis in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and the UK, before and during the pandemic. The results showed that UK nations had the biggest and most sustained falls in the diagnosis of lung, breast, colorectal and skin cancers during 2020. Particular data for Northern Ireland and Wales showed how badly they did compared with other countries studied. (Data for England and Scotland was still being collated but was expected to be as bad as the other UK nations.) While all countries reported a drop in cases diagnosed at the peak of the pandemic, most had caught up again within the year. In contrast, Wales and Northern Ireland still had not recovered their diagnosis rates by the end of 2020. The study calculated that between April and July 2020, breast diagnoses dropped by 35% in Northern Ireland and Wales, compared with 24% in Norway and 14% in Denmark. For lung cancer, over the same time period the decline was 16% in Northern Ireland and Wales, compared with 10% in Norway or 1% in New Zealand. For the most affected month, 44% of breast cancer cases and 30% of lung cancer cases were missed in Northern Ireland and Wales. There were also sharp declines in colorectal cancer diagnoses. The decline in cases diagnosed was largest for early stage cancers, partly due to the suspension of screening programmes. In Northern Ireland and Wales, stage 1 breast cancer diagnoses declined by 44% and 51%, respectively. Cancer experts said that as a result of such large drops in diagnoses, they are expecting to see many more patients presenting with more advanced, late stage cancers. \u201cThese data are a shocking wake-up call, providing the key evidence that the UK can expect a tsunami of missed cancers and a potential shift in stage that may lead to more aggressive cancers that are more difficult to treat,\u201d said Mark Lawler, professor of digital health at Queen\u2019s University Belfast and chair of the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership. \u201cAnd the fact we are still way off meeting the 62-day target to treat cancer can only compound the issue.\u201d A leading oncologist and co-founder of the Catch up with Cancer campaign, Prof Pat Price, said: \u201cThese figures are a timely and devastating confirmation of the colossal cancer crisis. Without urgent action, we will see more patients diagnosed at a later stage and more patients facing delays to treatment. \u201cWe were at the bottom of the cancer league tables before the pandemic, and as this study shows, we\u2019ve simply not recovered from the backlog in diagnosis. However, it does not have to be this way, as Lord Darzi\u2019s new NHS report highlights. If ever there was a time to deliver and implement a dedicated cancer recovery plan it is now.\u201d Naser Turabi, director of evidence and implementation at Cancer Research UK, said: \u201cThese findings suggest the UK health system lacks resilience in comparison with countries such as New Zealand, leaving it more vulnerable to the impact of Covid. This could have serious consequences for cancer patients who faced delays to diagnosis as a result of over-stretched services.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWhile we recognise the additional pressures placed on the NHS during the pandemic, it is unacceptable that so many people had to wait too long for a cancer diagnosis and treatment. \u201cLord Darzi\u2019s report laid out how severe the delays for patients waiting for a cancer diagnosis continue to be. This government is determined to change that as we create the 10-year plan to reform the NHS and make it fit for the future. \u201cWe will get the NHS catching cancer on time, diagnosing it earlier and treating it faster so more patients survive this horrible set of diseases, and we will improve patients\u2019 experience across the system.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-12T15:29:28Z",
            "content": "The world\u2019s demand for oil is growing at its slowest pace since the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, causing global market prices to slump to three year-lows, the International Energy Agency has said. The global energy watchdog used its closely watched monthly report to warn the industry that oil market prices could continue to fall as the leading producers kept pumping out more crude than the world could consume. The Paris-based agency said global oil demand increased by 800,000 barrels a day in the first half of the year. That was the equivalent to just over a third of the growth recorded in the same period last year, and was the smallest increase since 2020. Overall, demand this year is expected to reach 103m barrels a day (mb/d). In August, the world\u2019s oil-producing countries produced 103.5mb/d. The oversupply risks creating a glut of oil in the market. A barrel of crude has already slumped below $70 (\u00a354) to lows not seen since the global economy began recovering from the pandemic. The slow growth in global oil demand was attributed to the weakening of the Chinese economy. Demand for oil in China has decreased for four months in row this year. The IEA expects it to begin rising again, but at a slower pace than in recent years because of the country\u2019s progress in removing fossil fuels from its transport sector. A surge in electric vehicle (EV) sales in China has reduced the country\u2019s demand for road fuels, while the government\u2019s rollout of a vast national high-speed rail network has begun to reduce growth in domestic air travel, according to the report. The IEA has estimated that China\u2019s switch to EVs will outpace that in the west by the end of the decade, with almost one in three cars on Chinese roads being electric by 2030, compared with almost one in five in the US and EU. The agency said weak economic growth in the world\u2019s advanced economies could result in global oil demand this year being almost 2mb/d below pre-pandemic levels. \u201cWith the steam seemingly running out of Chinese oil demand growth, and only modest increases or declines in most other countries, current trends reinforce our expectation that global demand will plateau by the end of this decade,\u201d it said. The IEA has predicted that the world\u2019s demand for oil, gas and coal will begin to decline this decade in \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d of the fossil fuel era. Oil demand could reach highs of 105.7mb/d by 2028, it predicted, but it would probably plateau at this level before beginning a slow decline. The findings stand in contrast to forecasts produced by Opec+. The oil cartel also reduced its predictions for oil demand this year, but they remain more than double the IEA\u2019s forecasts."

            "date": "2024-09-27T15:00:38Z",
            "content": "The head doctor at Sydney\u2019s medically supervised injecting centre has compared the rise of synthetic opioids to a pandemic and says she is worried the government isn\u2019t willing to make the \u201chard decisions\u201d necessary to prepare for it. Dr Marianne Jauncey began raising the alarm about the increasing prevalence of nitazenes earlier this year but was concerned the Minns Labor government had been reluctant to act because it \u201cstill feels for many like an emerging news story\u201d. She said that while New South Wales Health officials were \u201ctrying to take this seriously\u201d, she was concerned about a lack of political will to take necessary measures to combat the threat, including by rolling out drug-checking services. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cSometimes public servants are limited in what they can do by the laws of the land and the politicians of the day,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether or not the politicians are prepared to make what might feel like some hard decisions, I don\u2019t know. That \u2026 is where I\u2019m concerned.\u201d Nitazenes are a type of synthetic opioid which are often mixed into other drugs without users\u2019 knowledge. They have been linked to more than 200 deaths in North America and Europe between 2019 and 2023. Earlier this year, NSW Health warned that nitazenes could be up to 500 times more potent than heroin and said four people had been hospitalised after ingesting them and suffering \u201csevere\u201d overdoses. Jauncey said the danger posed by synthetic opioids had reached a level where anyone who used illicit drugs, including \u201coccasional MDMA at a festival\u201d, should carry the opioid overdose treatment naloxone, which is free at pharmacies. \u201cIn my mind, it genuinely has got to that point,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not just that people are having some bad experiences. People are dying.\u201d Jauncey\u2019s warning comes after NSW parliament passed a motion on Wednesday, supported by the opposition and the government, to formally recognise nitazenes as a \u201cgrowing threat\u201d. Jauncey said the government should put the same energy and effort into preparing a public health response to nitazenes that they would a pandemic. \u201cI\u2019ve been in public health for 25 or more years. Everybody knows about flu pandemic planning, because even though the risk seems really small, the potential impact is so horrendous,\u201d she said. \u201cI would say we\u2019re in a similar position with nitazenes, although the risk of significant impact from nitazenes is not tiny \u2026 at all.\u201d Jauncey wasn\u2019t aware of any clients of the Uniting medically supervised injecting centre in Kings Cross using drugs there that were tainted with nitazenes. \u201cBut that begs the question, \u2018How would we know?\u2019,\u201d she said. The centre\u2019s only capacity for drug-checking was in the event of somebody having an \u201cunusual, unexpected, or really severe\u201d overdose, in which case they could send any leftover substance for testing, she said. Jauncey urged the government to introduce drug-checking services to allow people who used drugs to test their substances before taking them. The centre trialled drug-checking for six months this year through a research project run by Uniting and drug-checking advocacy and research centre The Loop, in partnership with the University of New South Wales. The findings are yet to be released. The premier, Chris Minns, has said his government will not make a decision on a drug-checking policy until after the drug summit later this year. The health minister, Ryan Park, said the government was concerned about nitazenes and it \u201ccontinues to embrace a comprehensive range of existing measures geared towards awareness, prevention and harm minimisation\u201d. Jauncey said MPs should approach the summit in good faith and act on the resulting policy recommendations rather than saying \u201cwe\u2019ll kick the can down the road\u201d."
