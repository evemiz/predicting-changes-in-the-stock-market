            "content": "A prolonged conflict in the Red Sea and escalating tensions across the Middle East risk having devastating effects on the global economy, reigniting inflation and disrupting energy supplies, some of the world\u2019s leading economists warn this weekend. Before a statement expected on Monday by Rishi Sunak in the House of Commons about UK and US airstrikes on Houthi sites in Yemen, economists at the World Bank say the crisis now threatens to feed through into higher interest rates, lower growth, persistent inflation and greater geopolitical uncertainty. After a second night of strikes against the Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen, President Joe Biden said that the US had sent a private message to Tehran that \u201cwe\u2019re confident we\u2019re well prepared\u201d. Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn on Saturday, on his way to Camp David, Biden declined to go into further detail. But there is now growing concern in government circles in London and Washington that as Sunak and Biden fight for re-election, events in the Middle East could dash what had looked like improved prospects for economic recovery and therefore their chances at the ballot box. While the airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen have broad cross-party support at Westminster, Sunak will face questions from anxious MPs about a prolonged conflict and the longer-term plan for Middle East peace. Some leftwing Labour MPs are expected to put Keir Starmer under pressure over why he backed the military strikes having said that he would only support such action after parliament had voted in favour of it. Biden also faced pushback from progressives in his own party, already deeply opposed to US military support for Israeli action in Gaza. California congressman Ro Khanna said: \u201cThe president needs to come to Congress before launching a strike against the Houthis in Yemen and involving us in another Middle East conflict.\u201d In its latest report on global economic prospects, the World Bank says the Middle East crisis, with the war in Ukraine, has created real dangers. \u201cConflict escalation could lead to surging energy prices, with broader implications for global activity and inflation,\u201d it says. \u201cOther risks include financial stress related to real interest rates, persistent inflation, weaker than expected growth in China, further trade fragmentation and climate change-related disasters.\u201d It adds: \u201cRecent attacks on commercial vessels transiting the Red Sea have already started to disrupt key shipping routes, eroding slack in supply networks and increasing the likelihood of inflationary bottlenecks. In a setting of escalating conflicts, energy supplies could also be substantially disrupted, leading to a spike in energy prices. This would have significant spillovers to other commodity prices and heighten geopolitical and economic uncertainty, which in turn could dampen investment and lead to a further weakening of growth.\u201d John Llewellyn, a partner at Independent Economics and a former chief economist of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), said: \u201cThis has escalated to become a serious problem.\u201d He put the probability of serious disruptions to world trade at 30%, up from 10% a week ago: \u201cThere is a horrible and inevitable progression that could see the situation in the Red Sea spread to the strait of Hormuz and the wider Middle East.\u201d An economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Ben Zaranko, told the Observer the crisis underlined the perils of the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, using limited fiscal headroom to promise tax cuts. \u201cIf we have learned anything over the last few years it is that bad shocks can and do come along,\u201d Zaranko said. \u201cSpending every single penny of \u2018headroom\u2019 on tax cuts leaves him no room for manoeuvre if a nasty shock comes along and the outlook deteriorates.\u201d The conflict in the Middle East widened on Thursday when dozens of British and US strikes hit Houthi sites in Yemen. The strikes were in retaliation for attacks on vessels passing through the Red Sea, which have paralysed shipping in one of the world\u2019s most important maritime channels. The Houthis say they are targeting only Israel-affiliated vessels, in an effort to support Palestinians in Gaza, but many of their targets had no known links to Israel. They have also fired missiles at Israel\u2019s territory. A US strike on a radar site in Yemen on Friday night prompted Houthi threats of a \u201cstrong and effective response\u201d to international attacks, and fuelled fears of regional escalation in a conflict already playing out across multiple borders. Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had had no significant impact on the Houthis\u2019 ability to prevent vessels from passing through the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. The top UN official for Yemen, special envoy Hans Grundberg, warned of \u201cserious concerns\u201d about stability and the fragile peace efforts in Yemen, which has endured years of civil war. The Houthis are just one of several Iran-aligned groups across the region, including in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon, which are attacking targets either inside Israel, or which they say are linked to Israel. Hezbollah in Lebanon represents perhaps the most severe threat. Farea Al-Muslimi, from the Chatham House Middle East programme, said: \u201cThe Houthis are far more savvy, prepared and well-equipped than many western commentators realise. Their recklessness, and willingness to escalate in the face of a challenge, is always underrated.\u201d William Bain, the British Chamber of Commerce\u2019s trade expert, said: \u201cAbout 500,000 containers were going through the Suez canal in November and that had dropped 60% to 200,000 in December.\u201d Ships are taking different routes, but that has raised costs, with a container that cost $1,500 in November rising to $4,000 in December. \u201cIf things get worse, it only adds to the disruption, and the cost of containers will go up and global trade will fall further,\u201d he said. Economists, many of them arriving in Davos this week for the annual World Economic Forum, have become increasingly worried that many of the world\u2019s major economies may now suffer a recession this year. They fear that central banks will make only modest cuts to borrowing costs, adding to the cost of living crisis faced by millions of households. The prospect of higher oil prices could convince central banks to hold firm and maintain high interest rates for a longer period than currently expected. Liam Byrne, chair of the Commons business and trade select committee, said: \u201cThere\u2019s now a real risk that a Red Sea battle will push up prices, just as inflation was beginning to fall. The World Bank is already warning that global supply chains are once more in peril \u2026 not least because this new struggle in Suez comes as drought is cutting trade through the Panama canal. Two of the world\u2019s five keys to trade are now in real jeopardy.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-25T13:51:33Z",
            "content": "The pace of US economic growth slowed in the last three months of 2023, but far less than had been expected, underlining the continued resilience of the economy. The commerce department reported on Thursday that US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of economic health \u2013 grew at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the final quarter of the year, down from 4.9% in the previous quarter but in line with pre-pandemic growth, and well ahead of the 2% economists had expected. Robust consumer spending and government outlays contributed to the growth. The Federal Reserve has been attempting to cool economic activity in order to bring down inflation. Since March 2022 the Fed has increased rates to a 22-year high and held them there. Inflation has fallen from a high of 9% in June 2022 to 3.4%. The rate rises have increased the cost of borrowing and many \u2013 including the Fed \u2013 had expected a subsequent slowdown in economic activity to lead to layoffs. But so far the Fed appears to be on course for what it has termed a \u201csoft landing\u201d. Hiring has remained robust \u2013 unemployment hovers at close to a 50-year low \u2013 and while growth has slowed, consumers have continued to spend, the US economy has weathered the rate rises and stock markets have hit record highs. \u201cThe Fed \u2013 so far \u2013 has managed to strangle inflation without strangling the economy,\u201d said Dan North, senior economist with Allianz Trade Americas. North said the Fed rate rises were still working their way through the economy and he expected 2024 to be a year of slow growth \u201cbut we are not using the recession word yet\u201d. Polling since the end of the pandemic shutdowns has consistently shown that consumers are pessimistic about the state of the economy. There are signs that the gloom may be lifting. Last week the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched monthly consumer sentiment index rose 9.1 points to 78.8, its biggest monthly advance since 2005. \u201cConsumer views were supported by confidence that inflation has turned a corner and strengthening income expectations,\u201d said Joanne Hsu, the University of Michigan\u2019s director of surveys."

            "date": "2024-01-15T17:45:00Z",
            "content": "Growing concern that heightened geopolitical tension could damage an already shaky global economy has dominated the start of the annual gathering of the world\u2019s business and political elite in Davos, Switzerland. Three potential flash points \u2013 Ukraine, the Middle East and Taiwan \u2013 threatened to overshadow the meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) aimed at rebuilding trust after the series of setbacks suffered in the past four years, including war, the Covid-19 pandemic and the cost of living crisis. Meanwhile, a study of global business leaders to mark the start of the gathering in the Swiss mountain resort showed UK chief executives embracing generative artificial intelligence more rapidly than their peers in other countries. France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, are all scheduled to address the WEF this week, as is Argentina\u2019s new president Javier Milei. With Middle East tensions rising, the US is sending its secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the its national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, to Davos. Israel\u2019s president, Isaac Herzog, is also attending, as are the prime ministers of Iraq, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, and Jordan, Bisher al-Khasawneh, and Iran\u2019s minister of foreign affairs, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian. The UK chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, and his Labour shadow, Rachel Reeves, are both speaking at this year\u2019s event. Hunt\u2019s predecessor, Kwasi Kwarteng, is also attending. Artificial intelligence will dominate Davos, with OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman due to appear on a panel. AI is seen by its proponents as a possible way of boosting growth, but the WEF said in last week\u2019s global risks report that it could be misused by hostile states and other malign forces. Interviewed by CNBC, Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that without measures to shape its use AI would lead to greater inequality. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s arriving \u2013 do not close your eyes or put your head in the sand. AI requires preparation.\u201d In its annual survey of chief executives, the accountancy firm PwC said almost half (42%) of those running UK companies had implemented the new technology in the past year, compared with 32% in other countries. The survey of 4,702 CEOs in 105 countries found the UK was one of the frontrunners in adopting the generative AI that runs chatbots such as ChatGPT and image generators such as Midjourney. Only 9% of German chief executives and 20% of French CEOs had adopted GenAI, along with 38% of US CEOs and 25% of China\u2019s CEOs. Only Norway, (53%), Japan (50%) and Finland (49%) had been faster. Kevin Ellis, a senior partner at PwC UK, said: \u201cAfter an uphill trek against economic headwinds, UK chief execs are seeking gamechanging opportunities. GenAI presents a \u2018move or lose\u2019 moment \u2013 implemented with care, it offers huge benefits for efficiency, competitiveness and ultimately profitability. \u201cThe UK\u2019s service-based economy makes it ideally placed for the GenAI revolution \u2013 building tech is only half the battle, ensuring people and businesses can use it is key.\u201d The PwC survey found UK chief executives upbeat about the prospects for the global economy, with 61% expecting it to improve this year \u2013 a threefold increase on the poll conducted in 2023. After almost two years in which the economy has moved sideways, UK business leaders were markedly less confident about the prospects for the UK than they were about the global economy. Only 39% expected it to improve in 2024, although PwC said this was up from 9% a year ago. At the Davos opening ceremony on Monday night, the WEF presented its annual crystal awards to architect and educator Di\u00e9b\u00e9do Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9, the Oscar-winning actor Michelle Yeoh, and the musician and producer Nile Rodgers. Yeoh, star of many hit films including Tomorrow Never Dies; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; and Everything Everywhere All At Once, was recognised for her work raising awareness and mobilising support for the United Nations\u2019 sustainable development goals, and for promoting sustainable fashion, disaster-preparedness and road safety. K\u00e9r\u00e9 received the award for \u201chis exemplary leadership\u201d helping Burkina Faso\u2019s Gando community create a socially, economically and ecologically sustainable future through projects that focus on education, health and the environment. The WEF also recognised Rodgers\u2019 humanitarian work, including fighting systemic racism, inequality and injustice, championing young people, and co-founding the We Are Family Foundation to promote cultural diversity after 9/11."

            "title": "UK economic growth to rebound in late 2024, leading forecaster says",
            "date": "2024-01-22T00:01:42Z",
            "content": "The UK economy will benefit from falling inflation and lower interest rates in the second half of the year, boosting growth and allowing the government to offer pre-election giveaways, according to a study by a leading forecaster. Handing Rishi Sunak a new year boost, the advisory business EY Item Club, which is sponsored by the accountancy firm EY, said its winter forecast showed that a long period of economic stagnation \u201cshould begin to fade this year as falling inflation, potential interest rate cuts and tax reductions create momentum for growth in 2024 and 2025\u201d. Sunak and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, hinted last week that a budget statement in March was likely to include tax cuts, building on the reduction in national insurance that was promised in last November\u2019s autumn statement and which took effect on 6 January. Further tax cuts could feature in the 2024 autumn statement before a general election expected before the end of the year, if the recovery proceeds as predicted. The report shrugged off the likelihood of a recession in the second half of last year and the possibility of a further three months of negative growth in the first quarter of 2024, saying the underlying signs of a recovery would soon take effect. An increase in gross domestic product of 0.7% in 2024 made in the firm\u2019s autumn forecast was upgraded to 0.9%, while the UK economy is now forecast to grow by 1.8% in 2025, up from the 1.7% predicted in October. Last year\u2019s growth was downgraded from 0.6% to 0.3%, emphasising a loss of momentum in the second half of the year owing to persistently high inflation and sharply higher interest rates. Yet a recession is still possible if the economy is shown to have in the fourth quarter of 2023 after contracting by 0.3% in the third quarter. Several economists said last week that a surprise 3.2% drop in retail sales in December revealed a level of weakness in consumer spending that could drag the economy backwards in the fourth quarter. Financial markets expect the situation to improve once inflation \u2013 which averaged above 6% in 2023 \u2013 falls as expected to 2% by April, and for the Bank of England to begin cutting interest rates in June. A report by Lloyds Bank found that seven out of 14 sectors of the economy reported growing demand, as measured by new orders, in December 2023, more than twice as many as in November 2023. A bounceback in the moribund property market, high levels of demand for flights and holidays and rising disposable incomes after a long period of decline were all credited with giving business a lift in confidence. \u201cBusiness optimism reached the highest level since May as 12 out of 14 sectors reported higher confidence levels about their output prospects for 2024 compared to the same time the year before,\u201d the report said. Simon French, chief economist at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said that despite fears of a recession last year and weak Christmas shopping figures, the UK\u2019s economic outlook had \u201cimproved markedly\u201d over the last 12 months. The EY Item Club said interest rates should fall from 5.25% to 4% by the end of the year. Martin Beck, the club\u2019s chief economic adviser, said: \u201cAlthough it remains possible that the UK may have slipped into a technical recession in the fourth quarter of 2023, the mood music around the economy is justifiably improving. \u201cHigh inflation and expensive borrowing costs have been two of the biggest obstacles to growth recently and, with both showing encouraging signs of subsiding, prospects for late 2024 and beyond appear brighter.\u201d However, he warned there were risks that his forecast could be undermined by global events. \u201cOngoing geopolitical tensions could push up energy prices, which may slow the decline of inflation and increase costs for households and businesses. \u201cPlus, while the Bank of England is expected to reduce interest rates this year, the timing and extent of these cuts remain uncertain and continued high rates could prolong financial strain. The first half of 2024 should tell us a lot about the UK\u2019s prospects of returning to growth over the medium to long term.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-07T09:00:16Z",
            "content": "Deep in the mountains of Hsinchu county in north Taiwan, a few dozen residents of Smangus are holding their daily morning meeting in a weatherboard hut, overlooking the towering peaks nearby. The remote Indigenous village, home to about 200 Atayal people, is preparing for Saturday\u2019s presidential election. They take it very seriously, running their own polling station since 2008, and discussing candidates with all the residents. \u201cWe normally don\u2019t talk about politics [at the meeting] but the presidential election is a big deal,\u201d says Lahuy Icyeh, a community leader. \u201cThe village elders encourage the tribe to choose who is best for Taiwan.\u201d The vote will be Taiwan\u2019s eighth direct presidential election since martial law ended in the late 1980s. The current president, Tsai Ing-wen, must step down due to term limits, and her current deputy, Lai Ching-te, is running to keep the Democratic Progressive party (DPP) in power. He\u2019s up against Hou Yo-ih of the national opposition Kuomintang (KMT), which ruled during the decades of authoritarianism, and the Taiwan People\u2019s party (TPP), led by founder Ko Wen-je. The campaign has been dominated by the Chinese Communist party\u2019s threat to annex Taiwan, but surveys have shown it is economic issues that are the main concern of voters, including low wages, housing affordability, energy security and inflation. In 2022, wages had the steepest yearly decline in 10 years, while housing in some Taiwanese cities ranks among the world\u2019s most expensive relative to income. Inflation was lower than many other countries in 2023 \u2013 2.48% \u2013 but a series of extreme price rises on individual products such as eggs worsened perception of the cost of living. Care for children and the elderly, corruption, judicial reform, education and rights for minorities are also immediate concerns. All three presidential candidates have made pledges addressing most big-ticket items but many of them are quite similar.Dafydd Fell, director of the Centre of Taiwan Studies at Soas University of London, says this has neutralised most debates except on the contentious future of Taiwan\u2019s nuclear power plants. Publication of polling \u2013 which could show any potential impact of these pledges \u2013 is banned in the 10-day blackout period prior to the vote. The Smangus community has clear asks: better assistance for elderly care, road improvements, and land rights and transitional justice for Indigenous tribes. But the village, which operates a kibbutz-style economy, including shared land and housing, and a flat-salary jobshare system, is protected from some of the economic issues. For them, the presidential election is about big picture themes, says Yarah Pihu, Smangus\u2019s Presbyterian minister and a community leader. \u201cWe want a president with an international perspective and a sense of Taiwanese identity.\u201d Masay Sulung a Smangus community leader, said: \u201cI expect 90% of Smangus to vote for Lai Ching-te. We have high expectations for Lai, he has a clear vision for the country.\u201d At a DPP rally in Taipei, 20-year-old university students surnamed Huang and Chen say they support the DPP\u2019s stance on gender issues, Taiwanese identity, and care for the elderly. But there are signs that young people \u2013 who make up about 16% of the voting public \u2013 are moving away from the DPP, which is now seen by them as the establishment. At a KMT rally, a 34-year-old man surnamed Liu says he\u2019s switching from the DPP because he thinks governments should change frequently. In Guanxi township, Hsinchu province, one woman surnamed Lee, feels the same, but she doesn\u2019t like Hou or Ko, so she\u2019s just not going to vote. Corruption is another major issue for most Taiwanese voters. Fell says political corruption is often the \u201cmost stressed issue in Taiwanese elections and has been the most influential issue in a number of local and national elections\u201d. \u201cAfter eight years in office, you would expect the DPP to be threatened by this issue, and the KMT has made a number of accusations. But it is not entirely clear which side owns this issue.\u201d Candidates have flung a dizzying range of accusations at each other, from plagiarism to illegal housing structures, dodgy income streams, and other forms of corruption. Past local elections have seen allegations of vote-buying, bribery, voter intimidation and political links with organised crime. \u201cTaiwan\u2019s local politics has been long dominated by \u2018electoral machines\u2019 - a system of voter mobilisation through networks of patronage and local political factions \u2013 ever since the authoritarian era,\u201d says Kevin Luo, assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThe entrenchment of the KMT party machine in Miaoli is a good example.\u201d According to the Taiwan Anti-Corruption and Whistleblower Protection Association, 11.6% of 1,677 city councillor candidates in 2022 had criminal records \u2013 more than 20% of them in the county of Miaoli, New Bloom Magazine reported. On a Friday night, independent candidate Tseng Wen-hsueh is rallying a crowd of people at a temple in Miaoli county on Taiwan\u2019s west coast, on a platform of anti-corruption and political change. Party loyalty runs deep here among a diverse mix of ethnic groups and a high proportion of state-run employers in its large natural resources sector. In 72 years, Miaoli has never voted against the KMT, regardless of national trends. A popular joke refers to it as \u201cMiaoli Nation\u201d. \u201cMiaoli\u2019s closed political environment allows those in power to do whatever they want,\u201d Tseng tells the Observer. Most people struggle to imagine change after so long without it, he says. \u201cSo most of the people tend to continue to choose KMT for the sake of stability in their own lives. \u201c[But] if someone wins for the first time, the public will have confidence when they vote, this is the most important thing. The public will understand that this vote in hand can really bring about changes.\u201d Once known as Taiwan\u2019s most remote village, Smangus only got electricity in 1980, and a road to neighbouring villages in 1995. That road \u2013 a trail of switchback turns and fuel-sucking inclines, punctuated by the remnants of frequent landslides \u2013 is now busy with campaign trucks and candidate advertising. But in Smangus the vote is largely decided. Since at least 2008, the village has voted for the DPP in almost direct inverse proportions to the pro-KMT region it sits in. But the main thing is that they will vote. \u201cWe enjoyed democracy later than other places,\u201d says Icyeh. \u201c It\u2019s important to choose someone who can protect and lead Taiwan and appreciate our hard-won democracy.\u201d"

The police received information that activists with the Palestine Action group were allegedly planning to stop the LSE from opening for trading on Monday by \u201clocking on\u201d to the building, and causing damage. Met officers, alongside officers with the Merseyside police, arrested a 31-year-old man in Liverpool on suspicion of conspiracy to cause criminal damage on Sunday morning.

All six individuals remain in custody. The group reportedly hoped to cause \u201chuge economic damage\u201d by climbing on top of two revolving doors at the front of the building, armed with red paint-filled fire extinguishers, before locking their necks to the glass entrance using bike locks. Other activists would lock themselves together in front of the main and back entrances, while fake bank notes, painted red to represent blood, were fired from \u201cmoney guns\u201d. The allegations come after a two-month investigation during which a reporter posed as a member of the group, the Express reported.

The software giant reported revenue of $62bn, up 18% year-over-year, surpassing anticipated earnings of $61.1bn. Its year-over-year net income rose 33% to $21.9bn. CEO Satya Nadella said: \u201cWe\u2019ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale. By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we\u2019re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.\u201d Microsoft Cloud revenue rose 24% year-over-year. Revenue from its Xbox content and services division increased 61% driven by the Activision Blizzard acquisition, according to the earnings report. Activision boosted the company\u2019s overall revenue by 4%. Microsoft, which recently overtook Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable company, last week became only the second business in history to reach a stock market valuation of $3tn. Microsoft is seen as a leading player in the realm of AI, both via its own efforts and its close ties to ChatGPT maker OpenAI, of which it is the largest shareholder. In November, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella played a key role in the return of Sam Altman as CEO of OpenAI after Altman\u2019s stunning ouster. Microsoft holds an observer seat on OpenAI\u2019s board. \u201cThe company\u2019s recent financial performance, marked by a remarkable 18% revenue surge in today\u2019s earnings release, signals a potent blend of innovation and strategic foresight,\u201d said Insider Intelligence/eMarketer senior director of briefings Jeremy Goldman. \u201cWhile peers like Alphabet and Meta navigate the AI landscape, Microsoft is firmly establishing itself as a frontrunner in the AI race.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s influence on the development of AI has grown so quickly as to attract scrutiny from regulators and those outside the tech industry. Investors shrugged off concerns over the growing headwinds as shares rose 10% over the past month. The US Federal Trade Commission announced last week that it had begun an investigation into the company\u2019s $10bn investment in OpenAI, as well as deals made by Google, Amazon and AI startup Anthropic. The United Kingdom\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority is likewise examining the deal. European Union regulators have said they may open similar investigations. The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in early December, alleging copyright infringement by ChatGPT. This quarter also marks the first time Microsoft reported earnings with Activision Blizzard, the A-list gaming studio behind hits like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, under its roof. In October, Microsoft completed its acquisition of the video game maker for $69bn following a lengthy back-and-forth with regulators. Citing redundancies within the two companies, Microsoft laid off 1,900 employees last week across its gaming division, including Activision employees as well as some working on the Xbox console."

            "content": "Kazakhstan\u2019s national airline has announced plans to float on the London stock market, bringing a potential windfall to BAE Systems, which has been an investor for more than two decades. Air Astana, which is 49% owned by the British defence company, hopes to list in London and Kazakhstan and raise $120m (\u00a394m). The airline, which is majority owned by the Kazakh sovereign wealth fund, did not say how much of the company would be floated and is yet to confirm an expected valuation range. The float, which has been years in the making, could offer a cash boost to BAE Systems, which manufactures fighter jets, submarines and warships, and acquired its stake via an unusual route. The company was pursuing a deal to sell its radar systems to the Kazakh military in 2001 and as part of the deal it agreed to help fund the launch of Air Astana through a $8.5m agreement. The radar deal fell through, reportedly under pressure from Russia, but BAE\u2019s interest in the airline remained, and the investment was valued at \u00a363m by the company last year. The listing offers a rare bright spot for London\u2019s stock market, which has experienced a dearth of floats in recent years. The City is struggling to compete with overseas rivals to land big flotations, and one of last year\u2019s biggest, the natural soda ash producer We Soda, was abandoned because of a disappointing valuation. Air Astana intends to use the proceeds of the twin listing to invest in expanding in its fleet and putting on more flights. It already flies to destinations across Europe, the Middle East and Asia, including key transport hubs such as London, Amsterdam and Seoul. Its board is chaired by Nurlan Zhakupov, a Kazakh citizen who was previously the managing director of the Kazakh mining company Tau-Ken Samruk and later chief executive of the Kazakhstan Investment Development Fund. The company has three Britons on its board, including its chief executive, Peter Foster, who ran Royal Brunei Airlines before taking over at Air Astana in 2005. Foster said: \u201cWe are confident that the initial public offering will accelerate the next stage of growth for the Air Astana Group, and we see significant opportunities to thicken our existing routes and expand into new geographic areas, supported by our continued fleet expansion plan and initiatives to increase operational flexibility.\u201d The former Soviet country has privatised a number of state-owned assets over the last decade, including national oil and gas, electricity and nuclear entities. If the listing is completed, it will bring a payday for bankers working on the deal at Citigroup and Jefferies."

            "content": "Peruse an online marketplace like Craigslist, and you\u2019ll find coded classified ads for \u201cStudy Help\u201d and \u201cStudy Hall\u201d, or calls looking for a \u201cStudy Buddy\u201d. Despite the scholarly language, these aren\u2019t people looking for pre-final cram session. They\u2019re plugs for Adderall: the trade name for a combination of amphetamine salts long prescribed as a first-choice treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It\u2019s a drug that is, of late, in perilously short supply. The US National Institute for Mental Health estimates that ADHD affects 4.4% of adults between the ages of 18 and 44. The number of adults treated for ADHD has increased in recent decades, attributable to the wider destigmatization of diagnosing the disorder in adults as well as the Covid-19 pandemic and its knockback effects on adult mental health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that adult prescriptions for ADHD medication increased by 7.9% between 2020 and 2021, compared with a 1.4% average annual increase between 2016 and 2020. In 2021, doctors authorized in excess of 30m prescriptions for Adderall, serving nearly 4 million patients. But over the past two years, many of patients have been unable to procure their prescription, due to manufacturing shortfalls. With the delta between demand and supply widening, some adults with diagnosed ADHD are forced to forsake CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and other drug retailers, and turn elsewhere. Smith (not his real name) is a lawyer in his mid-40s. He splits his time between New York City and Toronto, Canada. He was first prescribed Adderall in his 30s, while employed in the tech industry, work that demanded what he calls \u201csustained periods of concentration\u201d, to which he was unaccustomed. Between transitioning careers, and moving between countries (and healthcare systems with different best practices for prescribing amphetamines), he let his prescription lapse. \u201cMy ADHD is not so bad that I need to take something every day. But occasionally you just need it. You need it right now,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not difficult to find, if you know what to look for.\u201d Smith is familiar with those online black markets, and all the coded slang. In addition to looking for \u201cstudy help\u201d and \u201cstudy aids\u201d, search terms such as \u201cNFL\u201d and \u201cfootballs\u201d \u2013 a 30mg Adderall pill is typically pressed in orange, oblong tablets, vaguely resembling a regulation American football \u2013 also prove effective. There has always been an illicit market for Adderall, and similar drugs. Recreational amphetamine, typically called \u201cspeed\u201d, has been used for an array of purposes: as a performance enhancer for athletes; an appetite suppressant; a club drug stimulant, used to temper (or extend) the effects of alcohol and drunkenness. But increasingly, it seems that illicit amphetamines are being used for their stated \u201con-label\u201d effects: improving focus and concentration by tweaking the brain\u2019s production and regulation of the chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine. Smith says his typical contact is a \u201ca student in their mid-20s; not someone who typically takes part in drug trafficking. Just someone who has a script, and knows that people are willing to pay for it.\u201d He has made a habit of only buying a few pills on initial meetings, in order to guarantee the pills are bona fide, while also, in his terms, \u201climiting loss\u201d. But legitimacy is a huge issue with purchasing prescription amphetamines, or any drug, on the illicit market. In the months since the shortages began affecting the production and distribution of ADHD medications, pills have popped up underground that appear to be prescription drugs, but are anything but. The anonymous drug-testing database DrugsData.org has found \u201cAdderall\u201d pills circulating that contain straight methamphetamine, in cities from Boston to San Francisco to LA. In September of 2022, the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s (DEA) New England office seized a record 660,000 Adderall pills, which were laced with methamphetamine. (The Los Angeles Times also recently reported on an elaborate counterfeiting operation in Mexico, which repackages meth as Adderall, Vyvanse and other name-brand ADHD medications, in an attempt to fleece pharma-tourists seeking help south of the border.) Some experts have compared the increase of illegal meth in the underground Adderall supply to the opioid epidemic, which has seen diminishing reserves of oxycodone replaced with cheaper, and more dangerous, synthetic substitutes. Acetaminophen, aspirin, the antidepressant duloxetine and caffeine have also circulated illicitly, either pitched as, or pressed to resemble, legitimate Adderall. \u201cThe number of counterfeit generic Adderall analyzed by DrugsData was steady in the last 24 months,\u201d a spokesperson explains over email. \u201cThe big jump happened between 2021 and 2022.\u201d Gordon (also not his real name) is 40 and works in journalism. He was diagnosed with ADHD in his 20s, but always struggled with Adderall. An ex-girlfriend told him that the drug made him \u201can asshole\u201d. He confesses that, while taking Adderall, he could be \u201creally annoying\u201d. He had a stint selling cannabis, which put him in contact with underground retailers selling prescription ADHD meds. When there\u2019s a shortfall, he says, most illicit dealers tend to fit the profile described by Smith: prescribed users who \u201choard it in case of a shortage\u201d. Facing a dwindling supply \u2013 his local pharmacist told him: \u201cWe never have it\u201d \u2013 Gordon went to his doctors and switched prescriptions to methylphenidate, which is sold under the brand names Ritalin and Concerta (an extended release version). The switch-up has worked for him, especially because he retains a certain wariness about dealing and trading on the illegal market, given the widespread issues of quality and toxicity that have increased as a result of the opioid epidemic. \u201cGoing on the black market is very scary right now,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d rather just stay away from it, when things are so crazy.\u201d Other would-be buyers might not be as cautious as Gordon, or as savvy as Smith, and Adderall shortages look set to continue as drug manufacturers have production strictly limited by the DEA. The DEA has tried to reform its processes allowing drug manufacturers to apply for revised allotments on a quarterly (as opposed to yearly) basis. \u201cDEA is committed to ensuring that patients who need stimulant medications have access to them,\u201d Anne Milgram, the DEA administrator, wrote in a memo late last year. But for now, limited production remains a consistent problem, with supply falling short of demand by an estimated 1bn doses.

            "date": "2024-01-16T12:52:07Z",
            "content": "Pay growth in the UK slowed more than expected in November, in a sign that inflationary pressures have weakened more than the Bank of England was expecting when it issued its latest forecasts. Average pay growth was 6.5% in November, down from 7.2% in the previous month, according to the Office for National Statistics, as the UK jobs market weakened in response to high interest rates and stagnation across much of the economy. Economists polled by Reuters had expected total average earnings of 6.8% in November. Job vacancies tumbled at the fastest rate on record in December, the ONS said, in a further sign the UK labour market was now cooling. The ONS said despite the drop in wages growth, recent falls in inflation meant real wages grew for the fifth month in a row, easing the pressure on household disposable incomes. It added that overall, the jobs market remained stable with employment down only marginally and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.2%. The pound fell after the weaker than expected wage data prompted traders to raise bets that the Bank of England would start cutting interest rates in the spring. Sterling was down by 0.6% against the dollar at $1.2642. The central bank is expected to re-examine its outlook for the economy when officials meet next month. Most analysts expect the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee to hint at several interest rate cuts this year after acknowledging the weakening labour market and recent falls in inflation as indications of further stagnation. James Smith, the developed markets economist at ING, said it was probably a little early to expect a major change of direction by the Bank, \u201cbut recent data could lay the groundwork for a May cut as long as it continues to comply\u201d. He added: \u201cThe bottom line is that both wage growth and services inflation, the datasets that are guiding monetary policy right now, are below Bank of England projections.\u201d Financial markets expect five interest rate cuts this year by the Bank, taking interest down from 5.25% to below 4%. One of the Bank\u2019s key barometers, regular private sector pay growth, dropped further from a revised 7.2% in October (7.3% previously) to 6.5% in November, leaving it comfortably below the Bank\u2019s prediction for it to still be at 7.2% in December. Falling energy and fuel prices and the slowing economy have brought the headline rate of inflation down from 4.6% in October to 3.9% in November and are expected to exert further downward pressure in December when figures are released tomorrow. Samual Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said there was likely to be some concern inside the Bank that the steady picture for employment showed much of the jobs market remained tight, limiting further falls in wages and vacancies. The number of vacancies soared during the Covid pandemic as many older workers took early retirement, the number of workers signed off sick increased and younger workers opted to go back into education, but the ONS said vacancies fell for the 18th consecutive month in the three months to December, by 49,000 to 934,000. Analysts have also become increasingly concerned about recent global shocks from conflict in the Middle East that could harm trade and push shop prices back up again. The ONS figures on Tuesday showed that workers in the private and public sectors received almost the same level of pay rise, including bonuses, up by 6.4% and 6.6%, respectively, in the three months to November. In the private sector, restaurants, hotels and retailers offered the biggest pay rises of 7.2% on average, followed by City and finance workers, who received 7% on average. Construction workers were at the bottom of the pay league table with rises averaging 4.5%, reflecting the severe downturn across the building industry. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cIt has been tough for many families recently, but with inflation now falling and the economy gradually returning to growth today\u2019s continuing rise in real wages will offer further relief. \u201cOn top of this the cut in national insurance contributions will get more people back into the jobs market, not just supporting economic growth but saving a typical two-earner household about \u00a31,000 this year.\u201d"

            "content": "Inflation went in the wrong direction at the end of 2023. It might seem like a small, possibly insignificant, reversal of a downward trend, but December\u2019s rise in the consumer prices index (CPI) to 4% in December from 3.9% in November is a blow to the government and the Bank of England in their battle against rising prices. Setting aside the quirks in the figures, such as the rise in tobacco prices after a sharp increase in duty, the real problem was how businesses continue to charge each other ever-larger bills for their services. Last year, they had good reason to put up prices. They had higher gas and electricity prices to pay and workers had begun to play catch-up in annual wage demands to prevent a potentially huge drop in their living standards. Those pressures are ebbing away now, but still services firms are charging ever higher amounts for their work, and that is being passed on to consumers. Competition is supposed to prevent this happening. And while it seems to be influencing sectors such as food, where price inflation is coming down, in the areas of the economy most of us cannot see \u2013 the myriad of buying and selling for business and financial services \u2013 competition is failing to work its magic. Core inflation, which excludes items such as energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, was unexpectedly unchanged at 5.1% and services inflation increased from 6.1% to 6.2%. There are analysts who believe the Bank of England will be influenced by the latest figures to caution against any predictions of interest rate cuts. Before Wednesday\u2019s CPI release, financial markets had expected five rate cuts this year starting in May, taking the cost of borrowing down from 5.25% to below 4%. That timeline has since shifted slightly, with investors now forecasting June to be the start date for perhaps just four rate cuts this year. France, Germany and the US have seen the same blips in the downward path of inflation and officials at the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which covers the 20 members of the eurozone, have made more cautious speeches in recent days about the path of interest rate reductions. The UK is expected to see a small rise in January\u2019s figures when they are published next month, which economists are ready to put down to dramatic falls in energy price inflation last year that declines over the subsequent 12 months could not match. A rise in CPI for December and again in January will certainly make the Bank think twice about signalling sharp cuts in rates. It could judge that services companies need more harsh medicine in the form of high interest rates to force them to bring down prices. If that is the Bank\u2019s solution, Jeremy Hunt\u2019s plan to boast of sharply falling interest rates during an election campaign will be toast. There are still 1.5m households waiting to remortgage this year and their finances will look burned as well. Then again, much-predicted declines in the CPI during February, March and April, taking inflation down to 2% \u2013 notwithstanding an escalation of the Middle East conflict and its effect on shipping \u2013 could prove financial market bets to be more savvy than they currently look."

            "date": "2024-01-29T16:22:24Z",
            "content": "Households across England are facing an inflation-busting \u00a32bn council tax raid this spring despite Rishi Sunak\u2019s promise of pre-election giveaways to save his premiership. In a deal to address the worsening financial crisis hitting town halls across the country, officials in Michael Gove\u2019s levelling up department have told local authority bosses they expect the maximum possible 4.99% increase to be applied to council tax in April. The increases are likely to add about \u00a3100 to a typical band D council tax bill, adding to the financial pressure on families, with inflation currently at 4%. It comes as Sunak prepares to put cuts to income tax at the heart of the Tories\u2019 re-election strategy, with a raft of measures expected to be announced in the spring budget, to be paid for by \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d to limit spending on public services and welfare. Local government leaders and experts warned that by raising council tax, the burden of the financial crisis in councils was being shifted to the poorest households. David Phillips, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said it would hurt the poorest households most because council tax forms a larger share of their monthly outgoings than that of a wealthier family. \u201cIncreasing council tax while cutting most direct taxes \u2013 for example, national insurance, income tax and especially capital gains tax and inheritance tax \u2013 would be regressive,\u201d Phillips said. Last week Gove announced an injection of an extra \u00a3600m into local government funding in England to stave off the threat of a Commons rebellion by Tory MPs worried about cuts to services in their constituencies. He told MPs: \u201cTaking into account this new funding, local government in England will see an increase in core spending power of up to \u00a34.5bn next year, or 7.5% in cash terms, an above-inflation increase, rising from \u00a360.2bn in 2023-24 to up to \u00a364.7bn.\u201d However, in details glossed over by the government, almost half of the \u00a34.5bn boost is based on the assumption that every local authority in England applies the maximum allowable council tax rise. If it was frozen, the package would be worth a rise of about 4%, matching the current rate of inflation. Roger Gough, the Tory leader of Kent county council, said: \u201cThat spending power means us taxing the residents of Kent more. Or at least the government\u2019s expectations are based on that.\u201d James Lewis, the Labour leader of Leeds city council, said: \u201cPeople are paying more council tax each year and getting a lower level of service, as it stretches to cover reduced government grants.\u201d He said the share of his city\u2019s budget that was funded by Westminster had fallen from about 36% a decade ago to about 5%, after cuts worth \u00a32.5bn in total. \u201cBut we\u2019re still expected to cover that gap, largely through savings, council tax increases and money we make through fees and charges for services.\u201d Figures from the Institute for Government show councils have raised 30% more from council tax in real terms since 2010, in an attempt to fill a gaping hole from cuts to grant funding of about 40% during the Tories\u2019 first decade in power. Stuart Hoddinott, a senior researcher at the thinktank, said: \u201cIt\u2019s just shifting it to another place. You\u2019re replacing centralised taxation with localised taxation. It\u2019s as much of a burden on individuals as a rise in income tax, it\u2019s just one that\u2019s attributed to councils as opposed to central government. [But] if it allows the chancellor to announce they can cut tax by X at the budget, I can see why that would be appealing.\u201d Ben Bradley, the Conservative MP who is also leader of Nottinghamshire county council, welcomed last week\u2019s funding increase for councils, but said: \u201cThere\u2019s almost no point chopping \u00a3100 off tax bills nationally if you\u2019re adding on to it with council tax. There is support out there and polling that people are keen to see investment in public services as a priority. There is scope to do both.\u201d Council tax increases are capped at 4.99% each year unless a local referendum approves a higher amount, which has never happened. Only one referendum has ever been held, in Bedfordshire in 2015, when a majority of residents voted against it. Several troubled councils have been granted bigger increases of up to 15% by Gove in response to \u201cexceptional\u201d financial circumstances, including Croydon, Thurrock and Woking. Others, including Birmingham and Somerset, are seeking approval for 10% increases. The rises come amid growing calls for changes to council tax, which remains based on 1991 property valuations despite a vast increase in house prices over the past three decades. Council tax was introduced in 1993 to replace the community charge, known as the poll tax. Last week the Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP), the group founded by George Osborne to promote economic growth in northern England, said changes to council tax could help address the worsening \u201cemergency in local government\u201d for those authorities in less affluent areas with the lowest tax bases. The NPP said a household living in a house in Hartlepool worth \u00a3150,000 was paying more than \u00a3200 a year more in council tax than someone in Westminster in a property worth \u00a38m. A government spokesperson said: \u201cCouncils are responsible for their own finances and set council tax levels but we have been clear they should be mindful of cost of living pressures. We continue to protect taxpayers from excessive council tax increases through referendum principles.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-10T09:03:46Z",
            "content": "Greggs has hailed easing inflationary pressures after the UK\u2019s biggest bakery chain rang up bumper Christmas sales amid less travel disruption and enthusiasm for seasonal specialities such as festive bakes and chocolate orange muffins. The company said sales at established stores had risen 9.4% in the three months to 30 December as it attracted more customers with extended opening hours and by offering online ordering. Better weather and fewer transport strikes than in the same period in 2022 also contributed to growth, the chain said, as did higher prices on some items \u2013 although at a lower rate than earlier in the year. Extending its ranges had also helped sales, it said, with festive bakes, chocolate orange muffins and Christmas lunch baguettes \u201cin high demand\u201d, while pizza sales continued to perform strongly. Greggs said it had increased prices by between 5p and 10p on a some items last month but had held down the cost of bestselling items such as sausage rolls. Roisin Currie, the chain\u2019s chief executive, said the price rises were to help fund a pay increase for workers implemented this month, with store staff getting a 9.6% rise to at least \u00a311.62 an hour, ahead of the new legal minimum wage of \u00a311.44 from April for those 23 or older, but behind the independently verified living wage of \u00a312. She said Greggs had \u201cno plans\u201d to increase prices across its ranges as it expected a more stable cost base over the year ahead. Currie added that any further price rises would be \u201cminimal and would protect our value proposition\u201d. The strong Christmas topped off a good year for the Newcastle-based business, with sales rising by almost 20% to \u00a31.8bn in the year to 30 December as it bounced back with the return to high streets after the coronavirus pandemic. The company plans to step up the pace of growth and open up to 160 shops in the year ahead, having opened a net 145 last year, taking the total to 2,473. Greggs shares rose 8.5% in early trading on Wednesday. Currie said: \u201cI am proud of our teams, who did a fantastic job serving more customers as we continue to grow our shop estate and offer greater availability through digital channels and extended trading hours. \u201cWe enter 2024 with plans to continue to invest in our shops and expand supply chain capacity to deliver the growth strategy, supported by our strong balance sheet.\u201d The company added in a statement that while wage inflation remains, \u201cinflationary pressures are reducing and with good forward cover on food, packaging and energy we anticipate a more stable cost base in the coming year\u201d. It added that while higher rates of pay added to the bakery chain\u2019s costs, increased wages across the economy would also support shoppers\u2019 incomes."

            "date": "2024-01-05T13:13:40Z",
            "content": "Inflation across the eurozone rose in December after an increase in energy costs, reversing six months of consecutive falls and easing the pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut interest rates. Figures from the EU statistical agency Eurostat showed consumer prices across the 20-country bloc rose at an annual rate of 2.9% last month, up from 2.4% in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a slightly higher reading of 3% for December. The increase in the headline rate comes after the end of government support for utility costs, alongside a smaller annual decline in energy prices in December than in November connected to last year\u2019s one-off subsidy in Germany. In the flash estimate for December, inflation in food, alcohol and tobacco prices continued to moderate, easing some of the pressure on households across the bloc as the rate across those categories dipped from 6.9% in November to 6.1% last month. The figures come amid speculation the ECB will begin cutting interest rates within months amid a worsening economic slowdown across the eurozone, having increased borrowing costs to the highest level since the launch of the euro. Financial markets widely expect the world\u2019s largest central banks to slash interest rates this year as inflation falls back after the shock from the Covid pandemic and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, while there are growing fears of recession in several advanced economies. Economists said December\u2019s inflation data was unlikely to dramatically shift the timing of the ECB\u2019s first cut in interest rates because an increase in the headline rate had been widely expected after energy support schemes expired. \u201cSome investors will undoubtedly be concerned that this spike in inflation may put the ECB off cutting interest rates sooner rather than later,\u201d said Michael Field, the European market strategist at Morningstar. \u201cHowever, central bankers were always aware of the potential for this spike in inflation, thus it shouldn\u2019t factor in on their decision-making process. All eyes are on next month\u2019s inflation release, and whether we can get back to that all-important downward trend.\u201d Financial markets are betting the ECB will cut rates six times this year, with the first move coming as early as the spring. However, the central bank\u2019s president, Christine Lagarde, has warned it remains too early to \u201cstart declaring victory\u201d over inflation, while arguing that rates would need to remain high for a lengthy period to ensure inflation falls back to its 2% target. Jack Allen-Reynolds, the deputy chief eurozone economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the jump in December was \u201cjust a blip\u201d and that inflation across the 20-nation bloc would probably continue to fall over the coming months. \u201cPast declines in food producer prices have not yet fully fed through to consumer prices. Core goods inflation should keep falling as the impact of improved global supply conditions and lower energy prices continues to be felt.\u201d"

            "content": "The 20-nation eurozone has narrowly avoided recession after the region\u2019s economy flatlined at the end of 2023, official figures show. Zero growth in the single currency zone in the final quarter of last year followed a 0.1% economic contraction in the third quarter, meaning that recession \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 was just averted. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the eurozone\u2019s economy to shrink by 0.1% in the fourth quarter. The eurozone\u2019s two biggest economies both performed poorly in late 2023, with Germany contracting by 0.3% and France posting no growth for a second successive quarter, according to Eurostat, the EU\u2019s statistical agency. There was better news from the other two members of the eurozone\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d. Italy, which had been expected to stagnate, recorded growth of 0.2%, while Spain expanded by 0.6% \u2013 three times the 0.2% forecast. Of the smaller eurozone economies, Portugal grew by 0.8% in the final quarter, Austria expanded by 0.2%, while Ireland\u2019s economy contracted by 0.7% \u2013 its fourth successive quarterly fall in 2023. Eurostat said that the broader 27-nation European Union also posted no growth in the fourth quarter. From the fourth quarter of 2022 and the final quarter of 2023, the eurozone expanded by just 0.1%, while the EU grew by 0.2%. \u201cThe eurozone economy escaped recession by the skin of its teeth by the end of 2023,\u201d Diego Iscaro, head of Europe economics at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said. \u201cThe outlook for 2024 continues to be challenging amid faltering demand and increasing geopolitical tensions.\u201d The eurozone\u2019s stagnating economy will further pressurethe European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the countries in the monetary union, to start cutting borrowing costs. Bert Colijn, a senior economist at ING bank, said: \u201cA technical recession has just been avoided in the eurozone. Still, the eurozone economy has now been broadly stagnating since late 2022 and has lost substantial ground to the US in terms of GDP in recent years. After the buoyant post-pandemic reopening phase, the economy has now entered a phase of prolonged weakness.\u201d Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago, the eurozone has been struggling to cope with higher energy and food prices, and the damage caused to business and consumer confidence. The ECB raised interest rates last year to their highest level since the euro was launched in 1999. Nicola Mai, economist at asset manager Pimco, said: \u201cDespite a resilient early start in 2023, the eurozone economy was weak through much of the year, and we anticipate that this fragility will persist in 2024. \u201cThe reasons for this ongoing weakness are clear. Europe is still recovering from a lingering energy shock and has not experienced the same degree of fiscal stimulus as the more resilient US economy in recent years. The region\u2019s shorter debt maturities also mean that interest rate hikes have been felt more quickly.\u201d"

            "title": "IMF warns Hunt against tax cuts; eurozone avoids recession \u2013 as it happened",
            "date": "2024-01-30T15:59:44Z",
            "content": "Time for a recap The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has \u201cadvised the UK against further tax cuts\u201d. In its latest assessment of the world economy, the IMF said the government should prioritise preserving public services and investment, while keeping debt levels under control. An IMF spokesperson said: \u201cPreserving high-quality public services and undertaking critical public investments to boost growth and achieve the net zero targets, will imply higher spending needs over the medium term than are currently reflected in the government\u2019s budget plans. \u201cAccommodating these needs, while assuredly stabilising the debt/GDP ratio, will already require generating additional high-quality fiscal savings, including on the tax side.\u201d The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, hit back, saying: \u201cThe IMF expect growth to strengthen over the next few years, supported by our introduction of the biggest capital investment tax reliefs anywhere in the world, alongside National Insurance cuts to improve work incentives. It is too early to know whether further reductions in tax will be affordable in the Budget, but we continue to believe that smart tax reductions can make a big difference in boosting growth.\u201d The IMF also lifted its forecast for global growth, and said that a \u201csoft landing\u201d was in sight for the world economy. But there was gloom in the UK, with corporate insolvencies in England and Wales hitting their highest level since 1993 last year. In a busy day for economic data, the eurozone has narrowly avoided recession. GDP across the euro area was flat in October-December, despite a 0.3% contraction in Germany. France stagnated, while Italy, Spain and Portugal all grew. Here\u2019s the rest of today\u2019s news: There\u2019s been drama in the energy market today, with Saudi Arabia abandoning plans to grow its crude production capacity by 1m barrels a day. The world\u2019s biggest exporter signalled a big change in policy by ordering the state oil company, Saudi Aramco, to drop plans to expand its maximum production capacity to 13m barrels a day by 2027. US job openings unexpectedly rose in December to the highest level in three months, suggesting America\u2019s labor market remains strong. The latest JOLTS report shows that vacancies increased to 9 million at the end of December, from 8.9 million reading in the previous month. The report also shows fewer Americans quit their jobs in December. Over in the US, consumer confidence has risen to a two-year high as the slowdown in inflation cheers households. The Conference Board\u2019s Consumer Confidence Index rose in January to 114.8, up from 108.0 in December. The reading was the highest since December 2021, and marked the third straight monthly increase. Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, says: \u201cJanuary\u2019s increase in consumer confidence likely reflected slower inflation, anticipation of lower interest rates ahead, and generally favorable employment conditions as companies continue to hoard labor.\u201d The IMF has also given a thumbs-down to the free market policies of Argentina\u2019s new president, Javier Milei. The Fund has cut its growth estimate for Argentina, forecasting South America\u2019s second-largest economy will shrink by 2.8% this year, following a 1.1% contraction in 2023. Back in October, the Fund forecast 2.8% growth in 2024. Milei is making wide-ranging reforms to Argentina, deregulating the economy and removing regulations covering housing rental market, export customs arrangements, land ownership, and food retailers. He is also pushing through a wave of privatisations, ferocious spending cuts, a major expansion of presidential powers, and a scaling back of workers\u2019 rights and the right to protest, and proposing tax amnesties. But unions are resisting, holding nationwide strike action. The IMF\u2019s intervention comes less than two weeks after Jeremy Hunt hinted that he could deliver big tax cuts in his March budget. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in mid-January, Hunt told UK journalists that he wanted to take the UK in the direction of the faster-growing economies in North America and Asia which tend to have lower taxes. A week later, the latest public finances showed a drop in borrowing in December, giving Hunt up to \u00a320bn of fiscal headroom to lower taxes. The IMF, though, wants him to use that wriggle-room to keep the national debt in check, while also preserving public services and making critical investments. Some early reaction to the IMF\u2019s position: The last time the IMF intervened in UK government policy was September 2022, when it openly criticized then-Prime Minister Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget, points out Bloomberg. That mini-budget, which contained unfunded tax cuts and lacked independent assessment from the Office for Budget Responsibility, caused turmoil on financial markets and knocked the pound to a record low. Relations have improved under Rishi Sunak, who reversed most of the unfunded tax cuts proposed by Truss, but the fund\u2019s latest stance places it at odds with the government\u2019s clear ambition, Bloomberg adds. The IMF have confirmed that are advising the UK not to lower taxes further. They\u2019re holding a press conference now on their latest World Economic Outlook, released 40 minute ago, where chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas has been quizzed about their advice to the UK. Gourinchas explains that the IMF expects the UK to grow by 0.6% this year, rising to 1.6% in 2025 \u2013 which would be a return to \u201csome level of normalcy\u201d. And the IMF\u2019s message to the UK, and a number of other countries, is that they need to put in place medium-term fiscal plans that will accommodate a \u201cvery significant increase in spending pressures.\u201d In the case of the UK, Gourinchas says, that could include spending on health care and modernising the NHS, spending on social care, and on education. There is also the need for critical public investment to address climate issues, and also to boost growth. This means it is \u201cvery important\u201d to have medium term fiscal plans in place that accommodate this pressures, and ensure that debt dynamics remain remain \u201cstable and contained\u201d, Gourinchas explains. That requires a combination of tax and spending measures, so the government can allocate resources where they are needed while preventing your debt levels from increasing. Gourinchas adds: \u201cIn that context we would advise against further discretionary tax cuts as envisioned and discussed now.\u201d Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has responded to the IMF\u2019s warning, saying it\u2019s \u201ctoo early\u201d to know if he\u2019ll be able to cut taxes in the budget: \u201cThe IMF expect growth to strengthen over the next few years, supported by our introduction of the biggest capital investment tax reliefs anywhere in the world, alongside National Insurance cuts to improve work incentives. It is too early to know whether further reductions in tax will be affordable in the Budget, but we continue to believe that smart tax reductions can make a big difference in boosting growth.\u201d The timing of the IMF\u2019s warning against UK tax cuts is \u201cincredibly inconvenient\u201d for chancellor Jeremy Hunt, says ITV\u2019s Joel Hills. He writes: The IMF suggests there\u2019s a strong case for putting taxes up, given that, it believes the pressures on the public finances in Britain will only increase in the years ahead. An IMF spokesperson said: \u201cPreserving high-quality public services and undertaking critical public investments to boost growth and achieve the net zero targets, will imply higher spending needs over the medium term than are currently reflected in the government\u2019s budget plans. Accommodating these needs, while assuredly stabilising the debt/GDP ratio, will already require generating additional high-quality fiscal savings, including on the tax side.\u201d The global economy is gliding towards a \u201csoft landing\u201d after coping with the impact of tough central bank interest-rate action to reduce inflation, the International Monetary Fund has said. Revising up its growth estimates for 2024, the IMF said a number of major economies \u2013 including the US, China, Russia and India \u2013 had posted stronger than expected performances in 2023 and it was surprised by the resilience shown. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor said: \u201cThe clouds are beginning to part. The global economy begins the final descent toward a soft landing, with inflation declining steadily and growth holding up.\u201d Announcing details of the interim World Economic Outlook (WEO), Gourinchas said the IMF expected global growth to be 3.1% in both 2023 and 2024, upward revisions of 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points respectively. But he stressed the pace of expansion \u2013 which compares with an average of 3.8% during the 2010s \u2013 remained slow and there was a risk of turbulence ahead. More here. The IMF has warned UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt against cutting taxes, an intervention that is unlikely to be welcomed by the government ahead of the budget in early March. Instead of tax giveaways, the IMF argues the UK needs to curb public borrowing, rebuild its fiscal buffers, and prioritise spending in areas such as health, education and tackling climate change. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, IMF chief economist, told the Financial Times the UK\u2019s focus should be on \u201cthe path towards a fiscal consolidation\u201d despite expectations that Hunt will cut taxes at his spring Budget. Gourinchas says: \u201cWe would rather wish they would not do this type of tax cuts, and that they would instead focus on both addressing the spending needs and on the path towards a fiscal consolidation.\u201d More here. The IMF has cut its forecast for eurozone growth, in its updated World Economic Outlook. It now expects euro area GDP to grow by 0.9% this year, down from the 1.2% forecast in October. Expected growth in 2025 has been trimmed to 1.7% from 1.8%. It has also revised down Germany growth forecast to 0.5% in 2024, down from 0.9% expected in October. Newsflash: the International Monetary Gund has raised its forecast for global growth this year to 3.1%, up from 2.9% forecast in October. And in news that will cheer investors, the IMF believes that the much-hoped-for \u201csoft landing\u201d is in sight, in its latest update to its World Economic Outlook. The IMF\u2019s chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, says: \u201cWe find that the global economy continues to display remarkable resilience and we are now in the final descent toward a \u2018soft landing\u2019 with inflation declining steadily and growth holding up. But the base of expansion remains on the slower side and there might be turbulence ahead.\u201d Gourinchas warns, though, that overall growth and global trade are still lower than the historical average. Eurozone GDP will continue to stagnate in 2024 Q1, with growth below trend during 024, predicts Aline Schuiling of ABN AMRO Financial Markets Research. Schuiling explains: Growth will continue to be limited by the high level of interest rates. Moreover, fiscal policy will be restrictive as well, with energy-support measures for households and companies being unwound. On the other hand, the combination of a drop in inflation and still elevated wage growth will support household income. Besides, the upcoming start of interest rate cuts by the main central banks has resulted in some easing of financial conditions and has also lifted consumer and producer confidence, which should support domestic spending. No sharp rebound in growth is expected, however, and we do not expect growth to gain momentum and rise above the trend growth rate until around the end of the year Away from the eurozone, Mexico\u2019s economy only managed modest growth at the end of 2023. Government statistics show that Mexico\u2019s economy grew 0.1% in the fourth quarter, weaker than the 0.4% growth expected by economists. On an annual basis, Mexico grew by 2.4%, below the 3.1% expected. Today\u2019s GDP report shows that Ireland\u2019s GDP contracted in each of the four quarters of 2023, shrinking by 1.9% in Q1, 0.4% in Q2, 1,9% again in Q3 and then 0.7% in Q4. Ireland\u2019s Central Statistics Office says this is due to a decrease in the \u201cmultinational dominated sectors of Industry\u201d \u2013 ie large international corporations who base themselves in Ireland, partly for tax reasons. Ireland\u2019s GDP readings can be volatile due to the large multinationals based in the Republic, and isn\u2019t really a good tracker of its econony. The eurozone\u2019s refusal to fall into recession (yet, anyway) takes some pressure off the Euroepan Central Bank as it assesses when would be safe to start cutting interest rates. Alex Livingstone, head of FX and trading at Titan Asset Management, says: \u201cThe Q4 2023 growth numbers for the Euro Area revealed stagnant 0% growth, surpassing the -0.1% consensus for the quarter. Because growth isn\u2019t crumbling under the pressure of higher rates like some thought it might, this latest data print will buy [Christine] Lagarde some more time for inflation to return to the ECB\u2019s 2% target before cutting rates. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom for the eurozone, insists Michael Field, European market strategist at Morningstar: Field points out that growth among Europe\u2019s peripheral countries helped the eurozone avoid a recession, while the Big Two members struggled. Here\u2019s his take on this morning\u2019s GDP data: \u201cEuro area GDP was flat in the last quarter of 2023, coming in better than expectations of a 0.1% fall. This means that for the entire year, growth in the euro area economy was essentially steady. There are two ways to look at this. On the negative side, 2023 was effectively a dead year with zero growth, but on the positive side, despite record high interest rates and high inflation levels not seen since the 1970\u2019s, the euro area economy successfully managed to avoid a recession. \u201cA rebound in the peripheral economies of Belgium, Spain, and Portugal, registered the highest level of growth at 0.8% in the fourth quarter. While not blistering, this growth helped mitigate depressed growth in Europe\u2019s two powerhouse economies of Germany and France. \u201cLack of growth in the euro area contrasts uncomfortably with the over 3% growth in the US over the same period. The negative implication of this is that it makes regional investment decisions for international firms all that much easier to make, with Europe looking much less attractive at this point in time. This situation is reflected in economic sentiment readings released today, which declined month on month. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s not all doom and gloom in Europe. Inflation is within touching distance of central banks\u2019 targeted levels, meaning interest rates should decline over the course of this and next year. This brings much welcome relief to businesses and indeed consumers\u2019 pockets.\u201d Today\u2019s data shows that the eurozone fell further behind the United States at the end of last year. Data last week showed that US GDP rose by an annualised rate of 3.3% in Q4, which means a quarter-on-quarter increase of around 0.8%. Rather more impressive than the eurozone\u2019s 0% growth. That means the US grew as fast as the quickest-growing eurozone country in Q4, Portugal. We find out next month how the UK performed in Q4. The broad picture is that the eurozone has stagnated over the last year. GDP rose by just 0.1% in both Q1 and Q2 2023, before shrinking by 0.1% in the third quarter and stalling (as we just learned) in Q4. The eurozone economy \u201cescaped recession by the skin of its teeth\u201d by the end of 2023, says Diego Iscaro, head of Europe economics at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence Iscaro also fears thar that eurozone will struggle to grow in the first half of this year, after stagnating in the final quarter of 2023. He explains: Declining activity in Germany was offset by stronger than expected growth in Spain, while the French economy stagnated. The outlook for 2024 continues to be challenging amid faltering demand and increasing geopolitical tensions. The expected fall in inflation should help to support households\u2019 finances, although this positive impact will be at least partly offset by less supportive fiscal conditions. Similarly, we expect labour market conditions to gradually become less positive, although we currently project a modest increase in the unemployment rate this year. All in all, we think that eurozone activity will remain virtually stagnant during the first half of 2024. Among the eurozone member states for which data are available so far, Portugal (+0.8%) recorded the highest growth in Q4 compared to Q3, followed by Spain (+0.6%), Belgium and Latvia (both +0.4%). Declines were recorded in Ireland (-0.7%), Germany and Lithuania (both -0.3%). The year on year growth rates were positive for six countries and negative for five, Eurostat adds. Newsflash: the eurozone has avoided falling into recession, despite Germany\u2019s economy contracting and France stagnating in the last quarter. GDP across the eurozone, and the wider European Union, was flat in the fourth quarter of 2023, data from Eurostat shows. That follows the 0.1% contraction in the third quarter, and means Europe has narrowly avoided a technical recession (two negative quarters in a row). The growth reported in Italy (_0.2%), Spain (+0.6%) and Portugal (+0.8%) this morning will have helped keep the eurozone away from another contraction. Nick O\u2019Reilly, restructuring and recovery director at accountancy firm MHA, predicts there will be more large administrations in 2024: Following the news that England and Wales saw the most company insolvencies since 1993 last year, O\u2019Reilly says: \u201cThroughout 2023 we saw a steady rise in the number of reported corporate and personal insolvencies which we saw reflected on the ground in our work. This growth has been primarily driven by smaller businesses having difficulty paying back government COVID support leading to an uptick in the number of Creditor\u2019s Voluntary Liquidations. \u201cHowever, as we head further into 2024, we are likely to see more large-scale administrations compared to 2022 and 2023, as the impact of high interest rates begins to bite even further. This year is likely to be the busiest 12 months for insolvencies since 1993 as similar challenging conditions to 2023 will prevail \u2014 ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, falling house prices, still low levels of consumer confidence \u2014 combined with the lack of availability of interest payment holidays. This is highly likely to lead to some high-profile casualties.\u201d Newsflash: the number of company insolvencies in England and Wales has hit a thirty-year high. The Insolvency Services there were 25,158 registered company insolvencies in England and Wales in 2023. This is the highest annual number of company insolvencies since 1993, as firms across the country were hit by high interest rates and the squeeze on consumer spending. Last year there were 20,577 creditors\u2019 voluntary liquidations (CVLs), in which a company is voluntarily wound up after running out of money, plus 2,827 compulsory liquidations, 1,567 administrations, 185 company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) and two receivership appointments. One in 186 active companies (at a rate of 53.7 per 10,000 active companies) entered insolvent liquidation in 2023. So, as there are more companies in existance than 30 years ago, the 2023 rate remained much lower than the peak rate of 94.8 insolvencies per 10,000 active companies during the 2008/09 recession. Back in the UK, there\u2019s a small pick-up in the number of mortgages being agreed. The Bank of England reports that 50,500 loans for house purchases were agreed in December, up from 49,300 in November. And in a boost to borrowers, the \u2018effective\u2019 interest rate \u2013 the actual interest paid \u2013 on newly drawn mortgages fell by 6 basis points to 5.28% in December. This is the first drop since November 2021. The GDP data keeps coming\u2026 with Portugal reporting that its economy grew by 0.8% in the last quarter of 2023. Statistics Portugal adds that GDP grew by 2.2%, year-on-year, in Q4 2023, explaining: The contribution of domestic demand to the year-on year growth rate of GDP remained high in the fourth quarter, with an acceleration in private consumption and a slowdown in investment. The contribution of net external demand to the year on-year rate of change of GDP became positive, with Exports of Goods and Services in volume increasing more intensely than Imports. Germany\u2019s economy remains stuck in \u201cthe twilight zone between recession and stagnation\u201d, says Carsten Brzeski, ING\u2019s global head of macro. Following the news that Germany shrank by 0.3% in October-December, Brzeski argues that the country is probably in a shallow recession: The year 2023 was the first full year since 2020 in which the German economy contracted (by -0.3% year-on-year). The GDP numbers from previous quarters were revised. As a result, the German economy has just avoided a technical recession (ie two consecutive quarters of contraction). But with an average quarterly growth rate of 0% QoQ since the second quarter of 2022, the German economy is anything but fast-growing. The best way to describe the state of the German economy is probably that it is in a shallow recession. In fact, the economy remains stuck in the twilight zone between recession and stagnation. While Germany and France struggle, Italy has beaten expectations! Italy\u2019s economy grew by 0.2% in the fourth quarter of last year, statistics body ISTAT reports, beating expectations for no growth in Q4, despite weak domestic demand. On a year-on-year basis, GDP in the euro zone\u2019s third largest economy was up 0.5%. Istat reports: The quarter on quarter change is the result of a decrease of value added in agriculture, forestry and fishing and of an increase in that of both industry and services. From the demand side, there is a negative contribution by the domestic component (gross of change in inventories) and a positive one by the net export component. Newsflash: Germany\u2019s economy contracted in the final three months of last year, putting Europe\u2019s largest economy on the brink of recession. Statistics body Destatis reports that German GDP shrank by 0.3% in Q4 2023, in line with forecasts. That follows flat GDP in both the second and third quarters of last year (Q3 has been revised up from a 0.1% fall). Destatis says: After the German economy more or less stagnated in the first three quarters, economic performance decreased in the fourth quarter of 2023. Compared with the previous quarter, there was a marked decline, in particular, in gross fixed capital formation in construction and in machinery and equipment after price, seasonal and calendar adjustment Charlotte de Montpellier, ING\u2019s senior economist for France and Switzerland, says there are \u201cfew indicators\u201d that suggest the French economy will pick up strongly in the first quarter of 2024. De Montpellier writes: In fact, we expect stagnation to persist. We expect the French economy to recover only gradually in the course of 2024, with growth picking up slightly in the second quarter and then accelerating in the second half of the year. This recovery should take place thanks to more dynamic consumption against a backdrop of falling inflation and slightly improved purchasing power. Added to this will be the impact of a tight labour market. We expect growth to be even weaker in 2024 than in 2023, at 0.5% compared to 0.8%. Back in the UK, the slowdown of grocery price inflation has stalled this month, according to data from data provider Kantar. Kantar reports that supermarket prices were 6.8% more expensive than a year ago in January, slightly lower than the 6.9% drop in the year to December. The Czech economy grew by 0.2% in the fourth quarter versus the previous three months. That\u2019s in line with expectations, and shows a return to growth after Czech GDP shrank by 0,6% in Q3. On a year-on-year basis, the economy fell 0.2% in real terms, according to a flash estimate by the Czech Statistics Office. Over in Austria, the \u201cdownward trend in the domestic economy observed last year\u201d was halted in the final few months of 2023, statistics body WIFO says. WIFO reports that Austria\u2019s economy grew by 0.2% in Q4 2023, better than the 0.2% contraction expected. That follows two quarters of negative growth \u2013 -1.1% in Q2, and 0.5% in Q3 \u2013 meaning Austria has escaped a technical recession. WIFO reports that Austria\u2019s industrial economy expanded by 0.4% in Q4, while the services sector stagnated and construction shrank by 1%. For 2023 as a whole, Austria\u2019s economy shrank by 0.7%. Spain\u2019s economy minister, Carlos Cuerpo, has said the pick-up of growth in Q4 2023 is a good starting point for this year. Reuters reports: Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said that trend was expected to continue into 2024. The fourth-quarter reading \u201cprovides a good starting point to meet our target of 2% growth in 2024,\u201d Cuerpo said in a recorded video message. Newsflash: Spain\u2019s economy grew at a faster pace in the final quarter of 2024. Spanish GDP expanded by 0.6% in the October-December quarter, up from growth of 0.4% in July-September. That\u2019s faster than the 0.2% growth forecast by economist, which may mean today\u2019s eurozone GDP report is a little stronger than expected\u2026. On an annual basis, Spain\u2019s fourth-quarter economic output expanded by 2%, beating the average estimate of 1.5% in a Reuters poll. Here\u2019s a chart showing French GDP over the last three years: Here\u2019s economist Julian Jessop on this morning\u2019s French GDP report: In the City, Diageo, the world\u2019s top spirits maker, has missed first-half sales estimates this morning, following a sharp fall in demand in Latin America. Diageo has reported that organic net sales fell by 0.6% in the second half of 2023, driven by a $310 million or 23% decline in the Latin America and Caribbean region. Europe performed slightly better, with organic net sales growing 3%, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Turkey and high single-digit growth in Great Britain and Ireland (partly due to strong growth in Guinness). Diageo\u2019s brands also include Johnnie Walker, Tanqueray, Baileys, Smirnoff, Captain Morgan, Crown Royal and Don Julio. Debra Crew, Diageo\u2019s CEO, says: The first half of fiscal 24 was challenging for Diageo and our sector, particularly as we lapped strong growth in the prior year and faced an uneven global consumer environment. Excluding LAC, our group organic net sales grew 2.5%, driven by good growth in Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa. While North America delivered sequential improvement in line with our expectations, we are focused on returning to high-quality share growth as consumer behaviour continues to normalise in our largest region. As previously announced in November 2023, materially weaker performance in LAC, driven by fast-changing consumer sentiment and high inventory levels, significantly impacted total business performance. Newsflash: The Bank of England has fined HSBC bank \u00a357.4m for failing to protect some customer depositors for several years. The BoE\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority said in a statement the bank failed to accurately identify deposits that were eligible for Britain\u2019s Financial Services Compensation Scheme - which protects customer cash up to 85,000 pounds. The failings occurred for HSBC Bank (HBEU) between 2015 and 2022, and for HSBC UK Bank between 2018 and 2021, says the PRA, This is the second highest fine imposed by the PRA, which it says \u201creflects the seriousness of the failings.\u201d Sam Woods, Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation and CEO of the PRA, said: \u201cThe serious failings in this case go to the heart of the PRA\u2019s safety and soundness objective. It is vital that all banks comply fully with our requirements around preparedness for resolution. HBEU fell far short of its obligations in this area, and failed to disclose its failings to us in a timely manner. These failures led to today\u2019s action, including the significant fine.\u201d The news that France\u2019s economy failed to grow in the fourth quarter of 2023 comes as French farmers hold protests being dubbed the \u201csiege of Paris.\u201d Farmers argue they are being hit by regulations, taxes and falling pay. Yesterday, a tractor strike stopped traffic on eight main motorways into the capital, prompting the French government to warn farmers that any action to block access to Paris\u2019s main market for fresh food would be crossing a red line. President Emmanuel Macron held a crisis meeting with key cabinet ministers, on what was being called \u201cOperation Paris Siege\u201d. Prisca Thevenot, a government spokesperson, said announcements would be made on Tuesday. \u201cThe whole government and the president are mobilised,\u201d she said. Newsflash: France has avoided falling into a technical recession, after stagnating in the last half of 2023. Statistics body INSEE has got eurozone GDP day (details here) up and running by reporting that France\u2019s economy was stable in October-December, with growth of 0.0%. Trade supported the French economy, while its domestic economy struggled. INSEE explains: Final domestic demand (excluding inventories) contributed negatively to GDP growth this quarter (\u20110.1 points after +0.4 points in Q3 2023), due to the decrease of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF, \u20110.7% after +0.2%) and of household consumption (\u20110.1% after +0.5%). Conversely, foreign trade recovered in Q4 2023 and contributed positively to GDP growth (+1.2 points after \u20110.1 points). Imports fell sharply (\u20113.1% after \u20110.4%), while exports remained virtually unchanged (\u20110.1% after \u20110.6%). Finally, the contribution of inventory changes to GDP growth was negative again this quarter (\u20111.1 points after \u20110.3 points in Q3 2023). France\u2019s GDP for the third quarter of 2023 has been revised up too, to show zero growth, not the 0.1% contraction previously reported. Over 2023 as a whole, France\u2019s economy grew by just 0.9%, down from 2.5% growth in 2022. If it\u2019s poor, today\u2019s eurozone GDP data could prompt the European Central Bank into starting to cut interest rates this year, perhaps as early as April. Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets, explains: The French economy is predicted to improve modestly to 0% in Q4 from -0.1% in Q3, however there is considerable downside risk to this estimate if recent PMI numbers are any guide. In Italy the picture looks little better with a stagnation also expected, and a modest slowdown from 0.1% in Q3, while in Germany the economy is expected to be in recession with a -0.1% contraction in Q3 followed by a bigger -0.3% contraction in Q4. The only silver lining is Spain where the economy is expected to grow by 0.2%, however that is unlikely to be enough to prevent the bloc sliding into a technical recession with another quarterly contraction of -0.1% following a similar contraction in Q3. Inflation across UK shops has fallen to its lowest level since May 2022, as households benefitted from a slowdown in price rises of food and other goods. Annual shop price annual inflation eased to 2.9% in January, new data from the British Retail Consortium and NielsenIQ show. That\u2019s down from 4.3% in December, meaning prices are still rising, but at a slower rate. Food inflation decelerated to 6.1% in January, down from 6.7% in December, helped by a fall in the price of tea and milk, Alcohol, though, remained more expensive than a year ago due to increased duties, the BRC says. Fresh food inflation dropped to 4.9%, down from 5.4% in December, while non-food inflation eased to just 1.3% in January, down from 3.1% in December. This may cheer the Bank of England, which is due to set UK interest rates at noon on Thursday. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: \u201cSome New Year cheer as January shop price inflation slid to its lowest level since May 2022. Non-food goods drove the fall, as many retailers offered heavily discounted goods in their January sales to entice consumer spend amidst weak demand. Good news for the morning brew as the price of tea and milk fell, while evening tipples remained more expensive on the back of increased alcohol duties. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. We get a major healthcheck on Europe\u2019s economy this morning, as new GDP data for across the eurozone is released. Growth figures for France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria and Portugal will be released over the next few hours, culminating in the first estimate of eurozone growth in the final quarter of 2023. And it may show that the eurozone is in recession. Economists predict that GDP in the single-currency bloc shrank by 0.1% in Q4 2023. If so, that would be the second quarterly contraction in a row (GDP fell 0.1% in July-September), meeting the technical definition of a recession. The eurozone economy has been weighed down by high interest rates, and the cost of living squeeze caused by the jump in energy and food prices after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The euro weakened yesterday ahead of today\u2019s data, as Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG, explains: EUR/USD is trading lower at 1.0832 (-0.18%) ahead of the EA flash GDP data, expected to show a second consecutive quarter of contraction (-0.1% exp) and confirm the Euro Area entered recession. Also coming up today In a busy morning for economic data, we\u2019ll also learn if UK grocery inflation fell in the last month, and whether lenders approved more, or fewer, mortgages. The US economy, which has been doing rather better than Europe, will also be in focus, with the latest JOLTS report into job vacancies, a consumer confidence report and a house price index. We also get a healthcheck on the global economy, with the International Monetary Fund releasing an update to its world economic outlook this afternoon. There will also be disruption on UK railways today, as members of the Aslef union at Southeastern, Southern/Gatwick Express, Great Northern, Thameslink and South Western Railway strike in an ongoing pay dispute. The agenda 6.30am GMT: French GDP report for Q4 2023 8am GMT: Kantar\u2019s latest UK grocery inflation data 8am GMT: Spanish GDP report for Q4 2023 8am GMT: Austria\u2019s GDP report for Q4 2023 9am GMT: Germany\u2019s GDP report for Q4 2023 9am GMT: Italy\u2019s GDP report for Q4 2023 9.30am GMT: Portugal\u2019s GDP report for Q4 2023 9.30am GMT: UK mortgage approvals for December 10am GMT: Eurozone GDP report for Q4 2023 Noon GMT: Mexico\u2019s GDP report for Q4 2023 1pm GMT: IMF to publish its January World Economic Outlook Update 2pm GMT: US house price index for November 3pm GMT: Conference Board index of US Consumer Confidence 3pm GMT: JOLTS survey of US job openings"

            "date": "2024-01-15T12:00:33Z",
            "content": "Germany is on track for its first two-year recession since the early 2000s after its economy shrank in 2023 amid the impact of higher energy costs and weaker industrial demand. The German national statistics office said \u201cmultiple crises\u201d affecting the economy had contributed to a 0.3% fall in gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023, compared with the previous year, as higher interest rates and elevated living costs took their toll. \u201cDespite recent price declines, prices remained high at all stages in the economic process and put a damper on economic growth,\u201d said Dr Ruth Brand, the president of the statistics office, at a press conference in Berlin on Monday. \u201cThe German economy did not continue its recovery from the sharp economic slump experienced in the pandemic year of 2020.\u201d Germany\u2019s economy was 0.7% higher in 2023 than in 2019, the year before the pandemic began. However, analysts said Europe\u2019s largest economy was on track for another year of stagnant growth in 2024 at best, with a heightened risk of a second consecutive year of negative output. Carsten Brzeski, the global head of macro research at the Dutch bank ING, said: \u201cThere is no imminent rebound in sight and the economy looks set to go through the first two-year recession since the early 2000s. \u201cWe expect the current state of stagnation and shallow recession to continue. In fact, the risk that 2024 will be another year of recession is high.\u201d After adjustment for calendar effects, the decline in economic performance in 2023 amounted to 0.1%, the statistics office said. It added that in the final quarter of last year the German economy shrank by 0.3%, compared with the third three months, when output had stagnated. Germany\u2019s dominant industrial base, excluding construction, fell by 2% over the course of the year, as higher energy costs and dwindling demand at home and from abroad weighed on factory output. Reflecting the impact of higher energy bills and borrowing costs on consumers, household consumption fell 0.8% on the previous year, while government spending fell 1.7%. As well as having one of the worst performances among advanced economies last year, Germany is expected to experience one of the weakest performers in 2024, with EU forecasts published in November predicting growth of 0.8%. Experts said the country\u2019s economy was in \u201cpermanent crisis mode\u201d as supply chain frictions, persistent inflationary pressures, weaker global demand for manufactured goods and higher interest rates weighed on national output. Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe recent fall in inflation should provide some relief for households, but residential and business investment are likely to contract, construction is heading for a steep downturn and the government is tightening fiscal policy sharply. We forecast zero GDP growth in 2024.\u201d Separate figures on Monday showed industrial production across the wider eurozone fell for a third consecutive month in November, with a slump of 0.3% on the month as declines in Italy and Germany were offset by growth in France and Spain."

            "content": "Time to wrap up\u2026 here are today\u2019s main stories: In other travel news\u2026. Eurostar traffic has returned to pre-Covid levels with a 22% rise in passenger numbers in 2023. The cross-Channel train operator has announced that booming demand from London drove growth of 25% for journeys to Paris and more than a third on Eurostar routes to Brussels and Amsterdam, as total passenger numbers reached 18.9 million. Eurostar also said it had found a partial solution to allow it to maintain a limited service to the Netherlands during work at Amsterdam station, which had threatened to halt the popular route in 2024. The RMT union has announced that cleaners employed on TransPennine Express trains have suspended their strike action following an improved pay offer. Bidvest Noonan. which employs cleaners to work on TPE services, has agreed to implement a \u201cliving wage\u201d of \u00a312 an hour, as part of a pay deal, plus staff travel facilities which will save cleaners \u00a31,000 a year for rail travel. Back at the UK parliament, the top civil servant at the Treasury has rejected comments by the head of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that public spending forecasts last year were a \u201cwork of fiction\u201d. James Bowler, the Permanent Secretary at the Treasury, was asked about Richard Hughes\u2019s comments yesterday, and said he disagreed with them. Bowler told the Treasury Committee: I don\u2019t agree with what excellent head of the OBR said and I don\u2019t agree with the language he used. There\u2019s nothing new here. \u201cYou set out your spending plans, we have a three year spending plan, they\u2019re due to finish in just over a year\u2019s time and then you have an assumption as to what spending will be thereafter. \u201cThat\u2019s not a new, nothing\u2019s changed in that, so I don\u2019t particularly recognise that there\u2019s anything different. \u201cIt\u2019s very good that we have multi-year spending plans. As you go through a multi-year spending plan as you get further towards the end of it, the closer you get to setting new plans so it is the case that in just over a year\u2019s time that runs out, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s new.\u201d Hughes told the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords that the OBR\u2019s forecasts were based on \u201cquestionable assumptions\u201d that lead people to call his efforts a work of fiction, due to a lack of support from the government about its public spending plans. Over in New York. British billionaire Joe Lewis has pleaded guilty to insider trading charges on Wednesday, and apologized to a judge for his conduct. Lewis, 86, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and two counts of securities fraud, as part of an agreement with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan. As part of the plea deal, Lewis has the right to appeal in the event he is sentenced to prison time, his lawyer David Zornow said. Lewis, whose family trust controls a majority of the Tottenham Hotspur soccer team, was charged in July 2023 with passing inside information on his portfolio companies to two of his private pilots as well as friends, personal assistants and romantic partners, enabling them, according to prosecutors, to reap millions of dollars of profit. Addressing U.S. District Judge Jessica Clarke, Lewis said he knew at the time that what he was doing was wrong. Lewis said: \u201cI am so embarrassed and I apologize to the court for my conduct.\u201d Lewis was charged with 16 counts of securities fraud last July, which he denied, accusing prosecutors of making an \u201cegregious\u201d mistake. Over at the Post Office inquiry today, a former investigator has maintained that a branch owner-operator who had his conviction for embezzlement overturned last year was guilty. Raymond Grant, an investigator involved in the prosecution of the post office operator William Quarm, who died in 2012 not knowing he would eventually be cleared years later, had to be legally forced to appear to give testimony at the public inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal. He told the inquiry on Wednesday he had a \u201cclash of priorities\u201d and wanted to focus on his current job at the Salvation Army. Encouraging economic news from the US: American companies are growing their output at the fastest rate for seven months. Data provider S&amp;P Global reports that its Flash composite US PMI has risen to 52.3, from 50.9 in December, showing faster growth. But, as in the UK, the growth was driven by the services sector \u2013 while factories suffered from supply chain problems. S&amp;P Global explains: Businesses in the US signalled a stronger upturn in activity at the start of the year, as output growth quickened to the sharpest rate in seven months. The expansion was driven by service providers, as manufacturers continued to see a drop in production amid intensifying supply issues. The report also shows that the prices charged by firms are rising at the slowest rate since May 2020, which may show that inflationary pressures are easing. It\u2019s done it again\u2026 Also at PMQs, Rishi Sunak claimed that the Government\u2019s \u00a3500m rescue package for Tata Steel has saved 5,000 jobs and prevented the closure of its Port Talbot plant. The Prime Minister insisted the UK Government\u2019s intervention would also protect further workers in the South Wales\u2019 steelworks supply chain, Sunak said he knows it\u2019s an anxious time for steel workers, and claimed criticisms of the support package were \u201cchurlish\u201d. That\u2019s likely to go down like a steel balloon with workers at the Port Talbot site, who learned on Friday that up t0 2,800 jobs are at risk through the closure of two blast furnaces. Instead, Tata is building an electric arc furnace \u2013 partly funded by the UK \u2013 which will melt scrap steel, rather than producing virgin steel from iron ore. The owner of the Port Talbot steelworks has also been accused of \u201cgross hypocrisy\u201d, because it is prepares to open a new blast furnace in India, which will be one of the largest blast furnaces in the world. This morning\u2019s report from Ofcom into Royal Mail\u2019s universal service obligation is causing ructions in Westminster. Liam Byrne MP, chairman of the Business and Trade Committee, is urging the government to engage with the issue, saying: \u201cToday\u2019s report demonstrates once and for all that Government and Royal Mail must now get round the table to agree how the Universal Service Obligation works now and for the future. \u201cLet\u2019s be absolutely clear: the USO is a vital public service which is why we\u2019ve called for Government to get serious about talks with Royal Mail to agree a plan to secure its future.\u201d But prime minister Rishi Sunak told MPs he is committed to Royal Mail\u2019s universal service obligation \u201cremains as it is\u201d, after Ofcom suggested the six-days-a-week letter delivery requirement could be cut to five, or even three days. Asked at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions in the Commons if under his watch there will be no reductions in postal services provided by Royal Mail, Sunak said: \u201cI agree about the importance of the Royal Mail\u2019s universal service obligation, and as you will have heard from the minister this morning, we remain absolutely committed to ensuring that it remains as it is.\u201d Over in Argentina, the popularity of President Javier Milei\u2019s austerity blitz will be tested today as unions stage a general strike. Bloomberg has the details: The protest Wednesday organized by the CGT, one of the South American nation\u2019s oldest and most powerful union groups, will help set the tenor of debate as the libertarian economist attempts to slash the size of the state in a bid to tame triple-digit inflation. \u201cDepending on how many people they mobilize, the union will be able to demonstrate how much weight it carries at the negotiating table,\u201d political analyst Raul Timerman said in an interview. Milei won power last year promising a dramatic shake-up of Argentina\u2019s moribund economy amid rampant inflation and widespread poverty. He has already issued a decree deregulating vast swaths of the economy, while a so-called omnibus bill of austerity measures is making its way through the Argentinian parliament. Milei startled Davos last week with a fiery speech hailing free enterprise capitalism and claiming that the Western world was in danger having fallen to socialism. Eliminating cervical cancer across the UK would save thousands of lives and is estimated to save the economy \u00a32.6bn, according to a new report, following a pledge by the NHS in England to end the disease by 2040. Around 3,200 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in the UK every year \u2013 nine women every day, according to Cancer Research UK. It says 99.8% of them are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), which means that nearly every case is preventable. The UK could save \u00a32.6bn by achieving the WHO global targets for cervical cancer by 2046, according to a report from the Office for Health Economics, which was funded by cervical vaccine maker MSD. It will be launched in parliament at 1.30pm today. The World Health Organisation has set a target of four cases of per 100,000 women, by ensuring that 90% of girls are vaccinated by age 15, 70% of women between 35 and 45 are screened, and 90% of women with cancer are treated. The report said the UK would hit these targets by 2046, but warned that progress is not guaranteed, and called on governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to follow England\u2019s lead in pledging to eliminate cervical cancer by 2040. Vaccination and screening rates have worsened, according to the latest data published yesterday. This shows a one-dose coverage rate of 75.7% in year 9 girls in England, down from 82.2% in 2021/22. Of women aged 25-49, 65.8% received age-appropriate screening \u2013 down from 67.6% in 2021/22. Cervical cancer in the UK is associated with a lifetime cost of \u00a3208,086 per case. There are six licensed cervical cancer vaccines globally \u2013 MSD\u2019s Gardasil and GSK\u2019s Cervarix as well as jabs made in China and India. The NHS used Cervarix in the routine immunisation programme for girls aged 12-13 from September 2008; from 2012 it was replaced by Gardasil. Both vaccines protect against infection with HPV-16 and HPV-18, which cause the majority of HPV-associated cancers. Gardasil also protects against HPV-6 and -11, which cause genital warts. Metro Bank\u2019s white knight investor \u2013 the Columbian billionaire who helped rescue the bank in early October \u2013 has clinched a seat on the lender\u2019s board. Metro confirmed that the 65-year-old banking tycoon Jaime Gilinski Bacal would become a non-executive director, months after ploughing \u00a3100m of emergency funds into the lender in exchange a 53% stake. Metro Bank\u2019s chair, Robert Sharpe, said: \u201cJaime\u2019s appointment underscores the commitment he has long shown to the bank as a supportive, long-term shareholder. He brings decades of banking expertise and experience which will prove invaluable on the next stage of the bank\u2019s journey.\u201d As part of his rescue agreement, Bacal has been given the green light to appoint up to three directors in total to the board. However, he already leveraged his position into a boardroom seat for his daughter Dorita Gilinski in autumn 2022. Bacal said in a statement: \u201cThere are many opportunities for Metro Bank to grow and I am looking forward to playing a part in the evolution of the bank as we build on the solid foundational work undertaken to date.\u201d Economic storm clouds are also gathering over Germany. This morning, Germany\u2019s Ifo institute downgraded its 2024 economic growth forecast to 0.7%, down from 0.9%. Ifo cited uncertainty caused bya constitutional court ruling that has left the government scrambling to revamp this year\u2019s budget. And there could be worse ahead, if geopolitical tensions worsen. The Bundesbank has estimated today that an economic crisis in China would knock some 1.5% off German economic growth. According to its simulations, real German GDP would be 0.7% lower in the first year of the crisis and just under 1% in the second year. UK factories aren\u2019t the only parts of the economy finding January tough. Revolution Bars slashed its outlook for the year, telling shareholders that \u201cJanuary trade has started softly as guests recover from the expense of Christmas.\u201d Revolution is also facing higher wage bills, with the minimum wage set to rise by almost 10% in April, while customer numbers have been hit by Aslef train strikes. Rob Pitcher, CEO of Revolution Bars Group, says last Christmas was the best in four years, adding, It was pleasing to see our Revolution guests experience their first uninterrupted Christmas since 2019, driving growth for the brand. Revolution\u2019s younger guests are however still feeling the disproportionate effect of the cost-of-living crisis. Looking forward, both business rates and national living wage will increase materially in April 2024 and therefore we have had to take the view that, with inflation remaining high, the recovery for the Revolution business, our largest brand, will take longer than we had previously forecast. Newsflash: British manufacturers have been hit with a fresh drop in orders and have scaled back their investment plans, new data from the CBI shows. The CBI\u2019s industrial trends survey shows a contration in orders \u2013 its quarterly order book balance dropped to -13 in the three months to January, its lowest since July 2020. The survey also shows firms expect to cut back on investment in tangible assets such as buildings, machinery and equipment. It also shows a rise in costs \u2013 which may be due to the Red Sea crisis disrupting supply chains, as this morning\u2019s PMI report showed. CBI Deputy Chief Economist Anna Leach says: \u201cConditions in the manufacturing sector deteriorated unexpectedly at the start of the year, with output falling and order books at their weakest since the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d Worryingly, the report also shows manufacturers are cutting back on their headcounts: The pound has strengthened against the US dollar, after this morning\u2019s PMI report showed supply chain disruption was pushing up costs. Sterling has hit $1.277, the highest in over a week, suggesting a dialling-back of interest rate cut expectations\u2026. The UK PMIs point to brighter growth outlook but stubborn inflation, says ING developed markets economist James Smith. \u201cThe UK service sector, which accounts for the lion\u2019s share of economic output, edged further into growth in January, according to the latest purchasing manager\u2019s index. What\u2019s particularly interesting is that this extends a recent trend whereby UK service sector growth is apparently accelerating at a time when the equivalent eurozone index is edging further into contraction (though Europe\u2019s manufacturing sector appears to be bottoming out). Before last autumn, the UK\u2019s services PMI had largely tracked what was happening in its closest neighbours. This is another signal that the consensus among economists going into this year, which suggests the UK will underperform most major European economies in 2024, looks a bit too gloomy. While the recent sharp fall in market rates is good news for all economies, in the UK it makes a particular difference to the mortgage squeeze given the relatively high share of households due to refinance this year (around a fifth). Over in the eurozone, business activity in the euro area fell at the slowest rate for six months in January. The eurozone Composite PMI Output Index has risen to 47.9, showing the smallest monthly contraction in six months (but below the UK\u2019s 52.5, which showed growth). And although disruptions to shipping in the Red Sea caused eurozone supply chains to lengthen for the first time in a year, manufacturing input costs continued to fall on average, S&amp;P Global reports. Today\u2019s Flash PMI report on the UK economy (see 9.44am) shows that price pressures remain high, points out Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics. And that may worry the Bank of England, and make policymakers less keen to consider cutting interest rates. Webb explains: The services output prices balance nudged down from 58.6 to 57.3. But that remains consistent with services CPI inflation easing only gradually from 6.4% in December to around 5.0% in about six months\u2019 time. What\u2019s more, the shipping disruptions in the Red Sea led to the steepest lengthening in suppliers\u2019 delivery times since September 2022 and caused the input prices balance of the manufacturing PMI to rise from 47.5 to 53.5, to its highest level since March 2023. The further small rise in the composite activity PMI, from 52.1 in December to 52.5 in January, suggests that \u201cthe economy has improved\u201d, Webb adds. Newsflash: the Red Sea crisis is hitting UK manufacturing supply chains and pushing up input costs. Data firm S&amp;P Global reports that its flash UK Manufacturing Output Index, which tracks factory production, has fallen to a three-month low of 44.9. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction. S&amp;P Global\u2019s survey of UK purchasing managers has found that manufacturing supply chains suffered from longer wait times for container freight during January in the wake of the Red Sea crisis. With supplies taking longer to arrive, firms have been running down their inventories. S&amp;P Global explains: Supplier delays were overwhelmingly linked to longer international shipping times as vessels rerouted away from the Suez Canal. At the same time, preproduction inventories fell to the greatest extent since last August as safety stocks were depleted. These longer delivery times are adding to costs, with S&amp;P Global predicting UK inflation will remain \u201cstubbornly higher\u201d in the 3-4% range in the near future (it rose to 4% in December). The better news is that services companies are growing at the fastest rate in eight months, with the UK Services PMI rising to 53.8. That helped the wider recovery in private sector output gains momentum in January, lifting the overall UK PMI Composite to a seven-month high of 52.5. That should help the economy avoid recession, they say. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence said: \u201cUK business activity growth accelerated for a third straight month in January, according to early PMI survey data, marking a promising start to the year. The survey data point to the economy growing at a quarterly rate of 0.2% after a flat fourth quarter, therefore skirting recession and showing signs of renewed momentum. Businesses have also become more optimistic about the year ahead, with confidence rebounding to its highest since last May. Business activity and confidence are being in part driven by hopes of faster economic growth in 2024, in turn linked to the prospect of falling inflation and commensurately lower interest rates. Shares in Royal Mail\u2019s parent company, International Distributions Services, have now jumped 3.4% in London, as traders ponder the savings it could make from fewer deliveries. That\u2019re up 9p at 270p, adding to their earlier gains. Royal Mail shares floated at 330p in 2013, and swiftly surged over 500p. But they\u2019ve had a choppy ride since, hitting record lows below 120p early in the pandemic before receiving a boost from parcel demand. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, points out that there is opposition to Ofcom\u2019s suggested improvements to the Royal Mail universal service obligation: Royal Mail has long had its calls to scrap the government\u2019s USO rejected. Now it looks like the tide could potentially be turning. Although there is still considerable opposition including from the Communication Workers Union (CWU) which argues a three day service would \u2018destroy\u2019 the company, as well as the Postal Affairs Minister Kevin Hollinrake who said the government is committed to a six-day service. The company owned by International Distribution Services, has been facing a series of painful setbacks like the postal strikes, a fine from Ofcom for missing delivery targets and a cyber security incident. It has also been struggling with heavy operating losses on the back of a long-term structural decline in letter demand and the loss of its 360-year-old monopoly on delivery parcels from Post Office branches. Ofcom said letter volumes have halved since 2011, raising existential concerns about the future of Royal Mail and prompting calls for a drastic overhaul of the business to revitalise its finances and operations to ensure it doesn\u2019t become \u2018unsustainable.\u2019 Shares in IDS are trading higher today reflecting optimism towards the regulator\u2019s openness towards change at the embattled postal business. But shares are still sharply lower than the recent highs seen in 2021 during covid.\u201d Shares in easyJet have jumped 5%, despite the budget airline taking a \u00a340m hit from the conflict in the Middle East. EasyJet reported that there was a temporary slowdown in flight bookings for the wider industry after the 7 October attacks, as well as an ongoing pause on flights to Israel and Jordan. But, it says, demand and bookings have recovered strongly from late November. This allowed it to narrow its pre-tax loss in the last quarter, to \u00a3126m, from \u00a3133m in October-December 2022. Over in China, policymakers are cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in their reserves, to stimulate the economy. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) has announce it will cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for all banks by 50 basis points (bps) from 5 February. This is the first RRR cut this year, and should free up 1 trillion yuan (\u00a3110bn) to support lending. China\u2019s stock markets rose today, with the CSI 300 index up 1.4%. Mining stocks are rallying in London too. Kevin Hollinrake, the minister for postal services, believes Japanese IT firm Fujitsu should pay \u201chundreds of millions of pounds\u201d in compensation for its role in the Post Office scandal. Speaking to the Today programme, Hollinrake said: This will cost the taxpayer a billion pounds, maybe more than that. He added that Fujitsu, which supplied the flawed Horizon software, should pay \u201ca significant proportion\u201d of that bill. Last week, Fujitsu Europe\u2019s boss admitted the firm has a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to contribute to compensation for sub-postmasters who were wrongly prosecuted due to Horizon reporting that money was missing from their branches. The inquiry into Horizon also heard last week that some Horizone bugs were known about as early as 1999, but this information was kept from the courts. Hollinrake says what has happened is \u201cabsolutely disgraceful\u201d and a \u201chorrendous scandal\u201d, in terms of both its scale and depth, and the impact on people\u2019s lives. There\u2019s bad news for workers at asset manager Abrdn this morning. Abrdn is stepping up its cost-cutting programme, and today announced it will strip out another \u00a3150m of costs in 2024 and 2025, mainly across its group functions and support services. The plan will eliminate around 500 jobs. Abrdn says: The programme includes the removal of management layers, increasing spans of control, further efficiency in outsourcing and technology areas, as well as reducing overheads in group functions and support services. Citizens Advice are calling for proposals to tackle the causes of Royal Mail\u2019s \u201cpersistent failings\u201d. Morgan Wild, interim director of policy at Citizens Advice, says simply cutting services won\u2019t automatically make deliveries more reliable: \u201cGiven Royal Mail has failed to meet its targets for nearly half a decade, it\u2019s clear the current Universal Service Obligation (USO) is falling short of its fundamental purpose: safeguarding consumers. Any changes must prioritise their needs, not Royal Mail\u2019s bottom line. \u201cWe agree that improving reliability is essential. Late post has real consequences - people miss vital medical appointments, legal documents and benefit decisions. \u201cCutting services won\u2019t automatically make letter deliveries more reliable, so we must see proposals to tackle the cause of Royal Mail\u2019s persistent failings. Ofcom and the government have to spell out how any revised USO will start to deliver for the millions of us who rely on it.\u201d Shares in International Distributions Services, Royal Mail\u2019s parent company, rose by 1.8% at the start of trading in London, as traders digest Ofcom\u2019s report into its USO. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) have said a three-day delivery service would \u201cdestroy\u201d Royal Mail. CWU general secretary Dave Ward said the union could not support such a plan: \u201cWe are not resistant to change, but we will not sign up to a three-day universal service obligation, which would destroy Royal Mail as we know and would impact on thousands of jobs. \u201cRoyal Mail has the biggest fleet in the country, a presence in every community, and boasts and unrivalled infrastructure. \u201cThis is the bedrock that a serious growth agenda, and the future of the company, can be built.\u201d Ofcom CEO Dame Melanie Dawes is on Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme now, to discuss the regulator\u2019s report into Royal Mail\u2019s Universal Service Obligation. Q: Why should politicians make Royal Mail\u2019s job easier? They\u2019re failing to meet their current targets, and have terrible industrial relations\u2026. Dawes agrees that Royal Mail is not delivering. It needs to improve their quality of service. But there\u2019s also been a \u201chuge shift\u201d in the postal markets, with letter volumes falling and parcel demand rising. We have to respond to that, Dawes says, otherwise the service becomes too expensive, or worse, unsustainable. Q: Are you saying that Royal Mail could go bust if their obligations don\u2019t change? Dawes replies that Royal Mail is currently loss-making, and has a big transformation ahead. She adds that Ofcom fined them \u00a35.5m, just before Christmas, because of their poor service (missing delivery targets). Dawes adds: We will remain absolutely vigilient in making sure they deliver what they are supposed to do at the moment. But the regulator is also identifying where change is needed in the future, and wants to have a debate about this. Q: So, Royal Mail could scrap Saturday deliveries, and maybe other days as well? Dawes says some other countries already have an every-other-day service. But that needs to be combined with a really good overnight service, for deliveries that are urgent. Dawes says she isn\u2019t proposing a third class of service, on top of 1st and 2nd class \u2013 (implying, I think, that 1st class would be a guaranteed overnight delivery). Postal Affairs Minister Kevin Hollinrake said that Government was committed to a six-day service from the Royal Mail (as flagged earlier). Speaking after Ofcom suggested letter delivery days could be cut to five, or even three, Hollinrake told Times Radio: \u201cThe Prime Minister been very clear on this, six-day delivery is really important for many people in this country, many of our citizens, but also for many of our businesses.\u201d Questioned over whether the six-day model for letters remained sustainable, Hollinrake said: \u201cRoyal Mail made significant profits in previous years. They\u2019ve had a couple of difficult years not least because of some of the industrial action they\u2019ve been subjected to. But nevertheless we are keen to see Royal Mail become more efficient.\u201d He added: \u201cI believe the Royal Mail can build a sustainable model. But that sustainable model must be based on a-six day service.\u201d The UK\u2019s Communication Workers Union says Ofcom\u2019s report into the Royal Mail\u2019s Universal Service Obligation is \u201ccompletely dead in the water\u201d. The CWU is planning to produce its own report on the future of Royal Mail: CWU general secretary Dave Ward says: \u201cThe response to the leaked information over the week showed that CWU members, the public and politicians are united against the deliberate, manufactured destruction of the postal service. \u201cIn the ongoing debate, Ofcom now have no credibility whatsoever, and their views are an irrelevance to the discussion that must take place between postal workers, businesses and customers. \u201cTo produce a report without any input whatsoever from frontline workers or their union is an attempt to railroad through the failed agenda of the previous Royal Mail management team. \u201cThe CWU will not stand for that. We will now launch an extensive engagement exercise and produce our own report on the future of Royal Mail, taking on board the views of our members and customers. \u201cThis will be a blueprint for a sustainable Royal Mail that can grow our economy and our communities. Royal Mail could save up to \u00a3650m if it delivered letters just three days a week and \u00a3200m by stopping Saturday deliveries, the communications regulator has said (see 6.52am). The watchdog said a reduction from six to five days a week would save \u00a3100m to \u00a3200m, and going down to three days \u00a3400m to \u00a3650m, my colleague Alex Lawson reports. In a much-anticipated review, Ofcom laid out a series of options for the future of the universal service obligation (USO), which requires Royal Mail to deliver nationwide, six days a week, for a fixed price. The regulator began gathering evidence to show how the future of the service may be reformed to better suit consumers\u2019 needs, amid a long-term decline in letter volumes and a surge in the number of parcels sent as online shopping has grown. It has conducted consumer research and modelled Royal Mail\u2019s finances in the review, and will seek views with a further update planned later this year. More here: Ofcom want to hear your views to its suggestion that Royal Mail could deliver letters slower, or less often. The regulator is inviting views from interested parties by 3 April 2024, to understand the potential impact on people and businesses. This includes vulnerable people, those in rural and remote areas of the UK\u2019s nations, as well as large organisations who use bulk mail services. Ofcom will hold events around the country to discuss the evidence and options, and after considering feedback it will provide an update in the summer. Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom\u2019s chief executive, says: \u201cPostal workers are part of the fabric of our society and are critical to communities up and down the country. But we\u2019re sending half as many letters as we did in 2011, and receiving many more parcels. The universal service hasn\u2019t changed since then, it\u2019s getting out of date and will become unsustainable if we don\u2019t take action. \u201cSo we\u2019ve set out options for reform so there can be a national discussion about the future of universal post. In the meantime, we\u2019re making sure prices will remain affordable by capping the price of Second Class stamps.\u201d Ofcom argues that most people\u2019s needs could still be met if Royal Mail delivered letters less often. Having conducted market research, it says: Nine in 10 people (88%) say reliability is important for letter deliveries, compared to 58% for delivery on Saturdays (down from 63% in 2020).[7] Most participants in our research were also open to reducing some services and standards \u2013 particularly for letters \u2013 in the interests of keeping prices down and only paying for what was required. Similarly, there was strong acknowledgement that most letters were not urgent, but people still needed to have a faster service available for the occasional urgent items, even if that meant paying a premium for it. What about a possible subsidy for Royal Mail, as some other countries provide? Ofcom reckons it\u2019s preferable to change the specification of the universal service, rather than using taxpayer funds to maintain the existing levels of service and products. Ultimately this is a decision for Government, it adds. Ofcom is also not proposing downgrading Royal Mail\u2019s delivery targets \u2013 saying this is not an option for reform. It adds: In fact, it will be important to consider whether additional safeguards are necessary to ensure people\u2019s needs are fully met. Any changes must improve existing levels of reliability. Ofcom estimates that Royal Mail could achieve a net cost saving of \u00a3100m-\u00a3200m if letter deliveries were reduced to five days; and \u00a3400m-\u00a3650m if reduced to three days. If the large majority of letters were delivered within three days, it could achieve net cost savings of \u00a3150m-\u00a3650m, the regulator adds. NEWSFLASH: Ofcom is calling for the UK\u2019s universal postal service to modernise, as it publishes its review of Royal Mail\u2019s universal service obligation (see opening post). The regulator is inviting views on a range of options for redesigning the universal postal service to secure its future, while ensuring it reflects the way people use it. Ofcom points out that letter volumes have halved since 2011. And it says options for reform include changing letter delivery speed or the number of delivery days, as other countries have done, but not downgrading delivery targets. That could include cutting letter deliveries to just three days a week! Ofcom says it is proposing two primary options: Making changes to existing First and Second Class and business products so that most letters are delivered through a service taking up to three days or longer, with a next-day service still available for any urgent letters. Reducing the number of letter delivery days in the service from six to five or three. This would require Government and Parliament to change primary legislation. Ofcom does not have the power to scrap Saturday letter deliveries, as the six-days-a-week service is part of the universal service requirement stipulated by law under the Postal Services Act 2011. Changing the obligation would require primary legislation, and a vote by MPs in the Commons. Ahead of Ofcom\u2019s announcement, my colleague Alex Lawson has examined how other countries run their own postal operations: The chair of Royal Mail\u2019s parent company says its universal service \u201cneeds help to survive\u201d. Keith Williams, chairman of International Distributions Services, argues against \u201cnostalgia for a bygone era\u201d when assessing the future of Royal Mail. Writing in The Times this morning, Williams says there needs to be an \u201chonest conversation\u201d about how to protect the one-price-goes-anywhere postal service. He says: The number of letters we deliver has fallen from 20 billion to 7 billion. We only deliver about four letters per address, per week. This means we have to walk more than three times as far to deliver the same number of letters as we did before, increasing the cost per letter of each delivery. Williams warns that Royal Mail is currently \u201cstuck in a vicious spiral\u201d \u2013 without reform of the regulatory system, or a subsidy \u2013 leading to \u201cheavy losses and an unsustainable service\u201d. And on the possibility of Saturday letter deliveries being scrapped, Williams says there are other options\u2026 He says: There has been a lot of discussion about dropping letter deliveries on a Saturday, while retaining daily parcel deliveries, to tackle the problem of declining letter volumes and Royal Mail\u2019s material financial losses. The truth is there are a range of other options, including ways we can ensure a reliable service for time-critical mail such as hospital appointments and weekly magazines. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial market and the world economy. Royal Mail\u2019s future is in the spotlight today, with UK communications regulator Ofcom expected to release the findings of its review into its universal service obligation (USO). Currently, Royal Mail is legally obliged to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week, for a fixed price, something the postal operator insists is unaffordable. Ofcom\u2019s review will outline various options for the future of the USO, reflecting changes in the postal market as letter volumes fall, and parcel demand rises thanks to online shopping. Possible changes to the legal requirements of the British postal service could include changing its first and second class delivery targets (which it has strugggled to hit), or higher stamp prices. It\u2019s also possible Ofcom could recomment changing the current six-day USO, paving the way for the axing of letter deliveries on a Saturday. That should please Royal Mail\u2019s parent company, International Distributions Services, which warned last week that the six-day USO was \u2018simply not sustainable\u2018. But that would be controversial, not least with prime minister Rishi Sunak. Earlier this week, Sunak\u2019s spokesman said the PM \u201cwill not countenance\u201d scrapping postal deliveries on Saturday, as they provide \u201cflexibility and convenience\u201d for customers and are \u201cimportant for businesses and particularly publishers\u201d. Ofcom itself has said its review will set out evidence and options on \u201chow the universal postal service might need to evolve to more closely meet consumer needs\u201d. They added: \u201cWe will be inviting views on this, not consulting on specific proposals. \u201cIt would ultimately be for the UK government and parliament to determine whether any changes are needed to the minimum requirements of the universal service.\u201d The agenda 7am: Ofcom expected to publish its review into the Royal Mail\u2019s universal service 9am GMT: Eurozone flash PMI report into company growth in January 9.30am GMT: UK flash PMI report into company growth in January 11am GMT: CBI industrial trends survey of UK manufacturing"

            "date": "2024-01-19T09:27:02Z",
            "content": "The UK economy was probably in recession during the second half of 2023 if the latest retail sales figures were anything to go by. A surprise 3.2% slump in the level of sales in Great Britain during December appeared to show the cost of living crisis was continuing to hurt household finances despite a rise in wages that gave many consumers a bit more spending power. It will be a mild technical recession should the gross domestic product readings for the third and fourth quarters of last year prove to be negative when the latest data is released next month. But the R-word alone would undermine Jeremy Hunt\u2019s claims that the UK is on the right track and make his assertions that tax cuts are the main route out of stagnation look more Truss-like by the day. Hunt was probably unaware when he made his comment in Switzerland on Thursday of the dire situation on the high street (shops make most of their profits in the \u201cgolden quarter\u201d of October to December) after City analysts forecast only a 0.5% month-on-month drop. The downturn reported by the Office for National Statistics was unexpected after most of the big supermarket chains reported a healthy festive season and many large high street retailers \u2013 Next, for instance \u2013 said the same. Only the luxury brands such as Burberry were supposed to be having problems shifting their gear in the last month of the year. Analysts expected sales to remain largely steady after a 1.4% increase in November that was tied to Black Friday and forecast a small uplift in shoppers looking for pre-Christmas bargains. Now it seems those November sales simply stole from December, and rocketing prices, which have pushed up inflation by more than 16% over two years, took their toll. Food sales were down, along with sales of clothing and fuel. It was as if everyone stayed at home and did not drive anywhere in December, or at least not as much as they had for several years. Alex Kerr, an economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said Friday\u2019s figures would subtract about 0.15 percentage points from economic growth in December, \u201cwhich increases the chances the economy may have ended 2023 in the mildest of mild recessions\u201d. Looking back further, the ONS said a 3.4% annual fall in the volume of sales in 2022 was compounded by a further 2.8% drop in 2023. \u201cThis put annual sales volumes at their lowest level since before the pandemic in 2018,\u201d it said. Kerr said: \u201cLooking ahead, some of the drag from higher interest rates on existing mortgage holders may result in a further modest decline in real consumer spending in the first quarter of 2024. \u201cBut interest rate cuts from June and the further boost to real household incomes from falling inflation will support a recovery in real consumer spending in the second half of this year.\u201d The figures will turn up the heat on Hunt to address rising business rates, which were cut during the coronavirus pandemic but will rise again in April. The British Retail Consortium, which represents most of the large shop chains, said earlier this week that retailers would face a number of extra costs this year that it fears could increase the already rising level of insolvencies. Ominously, it said: \u201cWith an election in the next 12 months, it is time political parties understand the value of retail to the wider economy and set out a clear and cohesive plan for retail in their manifestos.\u201d"

            "content": "The Republican primaries are under way and \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 the candidates have been ganging up on Bidenomics. Spoiler alert: they don\u2019t like it. Fact check: they are wrong. To a man \u2013 and one woman \u2013 the Republican candidates all say that the US economy is bad and that Americans are struggling financially. They\u2019re warning about sky-high deficits, over-the-top government spending and a potentially catastrophic level of national debt. They point out that interest rates are at a 20-year high and the costs of core things like food, gas and housing are significantly more than they were just a few years ago. They point to a downturn in manufacturing and falling small business confidence. \u201cBidenomics is crushing American families,\u201d said the Republican candidate Nikki Haley. \u201cWe\u2019re paying more for gas, groceries and other basic necessities.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll rip up Bidenomics on day one of my presidency,\u201d the Florida governor and presidential challenger Ron DeSantis warned. Yes, prices and rates are up. But really? Is the economy so bad? I\u2019m a Republican and a small business owner with hundreds of clients in many industries and honestly the economy isn\u2019t that bad. In fact, it\u2019s been really, really good. Just ask Donald Trump, who implicitly admitted this when he recently said he hoped for a \u201ccrash\u201d and that it would \u201cbe in the next 12 months because I don\u2019t want to be Herbert Hoover\u201d. If you don\u2019t believe me, just look at the numbers. Last quarter\u2019s gross domestic product showed growth of 5.2%. That\u2019s a number that dwarfs all other pre-Covid recovery numbers in recent memory. Unemployment is at a record low. Each month the economy is adding hundreds of thousands of new jobs. There are millions of more open jobs available today compared with 2019. Yes, prices are higher, but inflation is down from a 9% annual rate to about 3%, so whatever the Federal Reserve did to offset the treasury\u2019s spending on fiscal programs seems to be working. The stock market is near all-time highs, as is household wealth. Credit card delinquency rates are lower than they\u2019ve been for the past 30 years as are delinquencies on all loans across the banking system. Holiday retail sales were strong and online sales boomed. Plenty of capital is available for businesses that need it and corporations have more cash on hand than in any year before the pandemic. I speak to dozens of industry associations each year and here\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing: just about everyone had a good 2023. The CEOs of our major banks reported strong earnings, after taking into consideration special assessments and one-time charges. Retailers and restaurants have recovered from the pandemic. Convention traffic in Vegas is back to normal. There are almost as many travelers through the airports as there were before Covid. Businesses in the service industries recorded their 12th consecutive month of growth. Sure, there are struggles. Businesses in the real estate industry are challenged by high housing prices and a 13-year low in home sales. Manufacturing has been in contraction for the past 14 months. Media companies are flailing. Technology firms are struggling to find financing. The cost of capital is slowing down financing for small businesses. However, we live in a giant country. California\u2019s economy is as large as that of the entire United Kingdom. North Carolina\u2019s economy is bigger than Sweden\u2019s. Texas\u2019s is bigger than Canada\u2019s. Not every business is going to be doing well in an economy this size. There will always be those that are struggling, be it because of their location, their industry, or the makeup of their customer and supplier base. There are plenty of things that could knock things off course in 2024. Wars. Oil prices. A terrorist attack. Another pandemic. If you want to find the bad in the economy you can do it. And that\u2019s what all the Republican candidates are doing and fair enough, it\u2019s an election year. It\u2019s also true that Bidenomics may not be the reason behind our strong economy. But saying the US economy is bad just isn\u2019t true no matter who you vote for."

            "date": "2024-01-24T14:08:02Z",
            "content": "This November\u2019s presidential election ought to be a doddle for Joe Biden. Fears of recession have receded. More Americans have jobs than ever before. Inflation is on a downward trend. Interest rates will be cut soon. The US economy is comfortably the fastest growing in the G7 group of leading industrial nations. Share prices are at a record high. It is the sort of record Rishi Sunak would die for. Yet here\u2019s a strange thing. As the prospects for the economy have brightened over the past 12 months or so, Biden\u2019s approval ratings have steadily fallen \u2013 from 53% to just under 40%. The polls suggest Donald Trump \u2013 who won the support of Republicans in the New Hampshire primary \u2013 is on course to return to the White House. When he was advising Bill Clinton during the 1992 presidential race, James Carville famously said: \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d \u2013 and back then it was. The then sitting president, George Bush Sr, was struggling because the US had been in a mild recession on his watch and he had raised taxes after promising not to do so. But there has been no recession under Biden. By almost every yardstick, the US economy is in pretty good shape, yet Americans don\u2019t seem in the least bit grateful to their president. It is too early to write off Biden. He is only just behind Trump in the national opinion polls, and the incumbency factor should give him a boost as election day approaches. As things stand, a Biden-Trump race (assuming that is the eventual contest) looks like it will be a lot closer than the one between Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer. Even so, Biden is clearly struggling to get his message across and it is worth exploring why that is. One obvious explanation is that the US, like just about every other developed country, has been through a cost of living crisis that has resulted in sharply higher interest rates from its central bank, the Federal Reserve. The US was less exposed than western Europe to the higher energy prices prompted by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, but it still cost a lot more for motorists to fill up their tanks. Food prices also rose sharply, as did the cost of a mortgage. The upshot of all that was that Americans felt they personally were worse off last year. Even though the economy was growing, it didn\u2019t feel like that to individuals paying more for life\u2019s basics. The US annual inflation rate peaked in the summer of 2022 at 9.1% and \u2013 despite the odd bump in the road \u2013 has been falling ever since. It currently stands at 3.4%, prompting speculation on Wall Street that the Fed will start to cut interest rates in the spring. Falling inflation has started to affect consumer confidence. Voters are starting to feel more upbeat about the direction of the economy and, while that has yet to translate into a more favourable opinion of the president, Biden will be hopeful that he will reap a political benefit. But he may not. Perception matters, and the perception many Americans have is that inflation is rising not falling and they are becoming worse off when the opposite is true. Negative feelings about the economy are much more pronounced among Republicans than Democrats, which suggests that views about the economy are being formed by non-economic factors. If you think Biden is too old and unfit to be president, then how can the economy possibly be doing well? Britain\u2019s election looks like it will take place around the same time the US will be deciding who should be its president, and there are lessons for both Sunak and Starmer from Biden\u2019s travails. Of the two, the prime minister clearly has the bigger and more urgent problem. While a lot can happen between now and the autumn \u2013 the most likely date for a UK general election \u2013 Sunak is much further behind in the polls than Biden and has a much less impressive economic record to put to voters. To take one obvious example, in the third quarter of 2023 \u2013 the latest period for which data is available \u2013 the US economy grew at an annual rate of just over 5%. The UK economy contracted. According to official figures, things are starting to improve. As in the US, UK inflation is well below its peak of 11.1% and currently stands at 4%. Wages are rising faster than prices, which means living standards for the country as a whole are on the up. For the first time in two years, the spending power of households has increased. Yet unless there is a wholly improbable boom between now and polling day, the average Briton will be worse off at the end of this parliament than they were at its commencement. If Biden is struggling to be re-elected, imagine how much more difficult it will be for Sunak. The state of the economy currently tops the list of voter concerns in the UK, but they are also worried about other things \u2013 such as the NHS, migration and housing. Taxes might be at their highest level since the 1940s, but looking at the shabby state of the public realm voters don\u2019t think they are getting enough for their money. And that\u2019s the lesson for Starmer. His pitch to the electorate is that Labour under his premiership will increase the economy\u2019s growth rate, freeing up resources and obviating the necessity for tough choices on tax. But even if he pulls off this devilishly difficult trick, the message from the other side of the Atlantic is that growth on its own is not enough.

            "content": "Wall Street has opened flat to slightly higher after stronger-than-expected US jobs data. The Dow Jones was little changed while the Nasdaq edged 0.2% higher and the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.3%. Over here, the FTSE 100 index is 0.4% lower while the German and French markets are down 0.3% and 0.6% respectively. The US workforce added 216,000 jobs last month, more than expected by economists, capping another robust year of growth in the face of higher interest rates. Policymakers, weighing when to start cutting borrowing costs, are closely monitoring the strength of the labor market as they try to guide the world\u2019s largest economy to a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d, where price growth normalizes and recession is avoided. American employers had been expected by economists to add about 164,000 jobs in December. Recruitment across the public, healthcare, social assistance and construction sectors helped drive growth as 2023 drew to a close. However, the increases in US jobs in October and November were revised lower by a combined 71,000. Inflation across the eurozone rose in December after an increase in energy costs, reversing six months of consecutive falls and easing the pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut interest rates. Figures from the EU statistical agency Eurostat showed consumer prices across the 20-country bloc rose at an annual rate of 2.9% last month, up from 2.4% in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a slightly higher reading of 3% for December. The increase in the headline rate comes after the end of government support for utility costs, alongside a smaller annual decline in energy prices in December than in November connected to last year\u2019s one-off subsidy in Germany. Thank you for reading the blog. Have a great weekend! We\u2019ll be back next week. \u2013 JK NatWest Group chairman Sir Howard Davies has released a sort of mea culpa, a statement to clarify his earlier remarks that it\u2019s not \u201cthat difficult\u201d to buy a home and people just have to save for it. He said he \u201cdid not intend to underplay the serious challenges\u201d people face buying homes. The interview on radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning provoked outrage, including from campaign group Generation Rent. Critics said his claims showed he was out of touch with the reality faced by many people trying to buy a home. Clarifying his remarks, Davies said: Given recent rate movements by lenders there are some early green shoots in mortgage pricing and while funding remains strong, my comment was meant to reflect that in this context access to mortgages is less difficult than it has been. I fully realise it did not come across in that way for listeners and as I said on the programme, I do recognise how difficult it is for people buying a home and I did not intend to underplay the serious challenges they face. People have to save much more than they did in the past and that is tough for first-time buyers. The role for banks in today\u2019s environment is to lend responsibly and support customers to build a savings habit and move towards home ownership. Torsten Bell, who runs the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the time required to save for a typical first-time buyer deposit has spiralled in recent years. The dollar has given up the gains made since the US jobs numbers were released, as people realised they are not as strong as it first seemed. The greenback is now flat against the pound and the euro, after jumping 0.5% and 0.6% respectively when the data came out just under an hour ago. While employers hired 216,000 people in December, more than the 170,000 expected by Wall Street, the November and October increases in jobs were revised down by a total 71,000. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7%. Axel Merk, founder of Merk Investments, said: Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: There are a few vital signs officials can monitor when trying to diagnose the health of the economy, and the labour market is a crucial one. Developments show that the US labour market isn\u2019t losing steam, ultimately suggesting that economic activity will need a heavier hand to slow it down. That could see interest rate cuts across the pond pushed further out than hoped \u2013 bad news for the market, which until recently was pricing in heavy cuts this year. The data has short-term implications, but the bigger question looks to the future. The resilience shown by the US labour market has been markedly stronger than predicted, which makes bringing things in line without triggering a rock-hard landing becomes a much more delicate task. 2023 overall was a bumper year for the labour market, and the overall temperature is still too hot to be fully comfortable. There\u2019s every chance the Federal Reserve will demand a run of softer macro readings before hitting the rewind button on rates. It shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that the rate of labour growth is slowing, which is a step in the right direction, but there\u2019s work to be done. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said: The slightly bigger-than-expected 216,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in December coupled with a second consecutive 0.4% m/m gain in average hourly earnings means that this labour market report will trigger a further paring back of expectations for a March rate cut. At this stage, however, all that really matters for the Fed is the CPI and PPI data, due next week, which we expect to be more supportive of early action from the Fed. The 216,000 gain last month, was not quite as good as it looks at first glance. Gains in the preceding two months were revised down by a cumulative 71,000. The increase in December was once again concentrated in only a few non-cyclical sectors, with government employment rising by 52,000 and health &amp; social assistance employment up by 59,000. To the extent that it is still a leading indicator of broader employment trends, the 33,000 decline in temporary jobs is also a concern. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.7%, but only because a 676,000 drop back in the size of the labour force almost kept pace with a 683,000 decline in the household survey measure of employment. Those declines more than offset the big gains in November, meaning that both are now below the October levels. With the unemployment rate still muted, December brought a second consecutive 0.4% m/m gain in average hourly earnings, which was enough to push the annual rate back up to 4.1%, from 4.0%. The dollar jumped after the stronger-than-expected increase in US jobs in December, as this suggests the Federal Reserve won\u2019t be in a rush to interest rates. The dollar index hit 103.10, a fresh two-week high, and is now at 102.75, up 0.3%. The greenback strengthened as much as 0.5% against sterling and 0.6% against the euro. It is now trading 0.2% higher against the pound at $1.2650 and against the euro at $1.0917. Some 52,000 new jobs were in government while 164,000 came from the private sector. Here is our full story on the figures: However, Peter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, tweeted: NEWSFLASH: The US economy added 216,000 jobs last month, more than expected, although the November and October increases were revised lower. Economists had expected an increase between 150,000 and 170,000. November\u2019s rise was revised to 173,000 from 199,000 while the October figure was also revised lower, to 105,000 from 150,000, according to the US Labor Department. The unemployment rate stayed at 3.7%, while analysts had expected an uptick to 3.8%. In the meantime, shares in London-listed Revolution Bars have plunged nearly 20% after the company said it would shut eight of its worst-performing bars to reduce future site losses. The company\u2019s bars and pubs trade under the Revolution, Revoluci\u00f3n de Cuba and Peach Pubs brands. The closed bars are: Revolution Bars in Beaconsfield, Derby, Reading, St Peters Liverpool and Wilmslow, Revoluci\u00f3n de Cubas in Sheffield and Southampton and the Playhouse in Newcastle-Under-Lyme. Negotiations for five of the eight bars have already begun for them to be transferred to other operators or their leases rescinded. The closures come despite a 9% rise in like-for-like sales in the four weeks from 4 to 31 December, the group\u2019s best festive period since 2019. But it is worried about the current macro-economic conditions. Like-for-like sales for the first half, including New Year\u2019s Eve, were on an improving trend but remained negative, with a decline of 2.8%. Rob Pitcher, chief executive of Revolution Bars Group, said: We have had the best festive trading period for four years with all of our brands recording positive like for like sales and Revoluci\u00f3n de Cuba being the standout performer. However, our younger customers are still feeling the disproportionate effect of the cost-of-living crisis and the national living wage will increase materially in April 2024. Therefore, we have taken the difficult yet ultimately beneficial step for the Group to close several bars which are unprofitable. Less than 10 minutes to go until non-farm payrolls, a key US jobs report, for December. We are expecting an 150,000 increase in jobs after November\u2019s 199,000. The dollar is rising ahead of the data, heading for its steepest weekly rise since May, as traders are scaling back expectations of early US interest rate cuts this year. The dollar is up 0.2% against a basket of currencies, after touching a fresh three-week high. The index is up 1.3% this week so far, its strongest performance since the week to 15 May. The chair of NatWest Group, Sir Howard Davies, has been criticised as being out of touch, after he said it was not \u201cthat difficult\u201d buy a house at the moment. The campaign group Generation Rent said Davies\u2019s comments were \u201castounding to hear from a senior banker\u201d. Here is our full story: Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank, tweeted: If your home has been flooded, here\u2019s the ABI\u2019s six flood recovery steps: Step 1 - Contact your insurer as soon as possible. They will advise you on arranging emergency accommodation if necessary (or any temporary alternative trading premises if you are a business with business interruption cover), the information they will need from you to support your claim, and how to go ahead with the immediate clean-up and repair process. Step 2 - Assessing the damage and finding temporary accommodation. A loss adjuster will be appointed to assess the claim. An initial assessment of the damage will be done, the repair process explained and the options for alternative accommodation outlined. You should expect to hear from your loss adjuster after contacting your insurer and they will get in touch if they need to arrange a visit to your home. Step 3 - Cleaning and stripping out. Your loss adjuster will organise the cleaning and stripping out of your home. This work should start within four weeks of discussing it with your loss adjuster. Step 4 - Disinfecting and drying your home. Your insurer or loss adjuster will appoint a drying company to disinfect and dry out your home. This can take from a few weeks to several months. Your loss adjuster will give you a timetable and keep you informed. Step 5 - Repair and reconstruction. Repair work should begin shortly after you get your drying certificate from the drying company. Your loss adjuster will appoint a builder to do the repair and reconstruction work and will keep you updated on expected timeframes. Step 6 - Moving back into your home. Your insurer or loss adjuster will discuss with you when you can return home. Depending on how badly damaged your home is, this can be between a few weeks and a year or more after the flood. Some insurers will provide \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d which offers homeowners the chance to install Property Flood Resilience measures up to the value of \u00a310,000 when repairing their properties after a flood. Speak to your insurer about whether you are eligible. The ABI\u2019s guide is here. Here is some insurance advice for homeowners and businesses who have been affected by flooding and storm Henk, from the Association of British Insurers. Damage caused by floods and storm is covered by most standard home insurance and commercial business policies, and comprehensive motor insurance. Louise Clark, general insurance policy adviser at the industry body, said: Insurers expect bad weather to strike at any time and events such as this are exactly what your insurance is for. Their priority right now is to help any affected customers recover as quickly as possible. If you have been affected by flooding, contact your insurer as soon as you can and they will be able to offer help and advice. If you have suffered storm damage: \u00b7 Contact your insurer as soon as possible. Most will have 24-hour emergency helplines to ensure you get advice on what to do and arrange repairs as quickly as is possible. \u00b7 If necessary, arrange temporary emergency repairs to stop any damage getting worse, but speak to your insurer first. If you have to arrange emergency repairs yourself, tell your insurer and keep any receipts, as this will form part of your claim. \u00b7 Do not be in a rush to throw away damaged items, unless they are a danger to health, as these may be able to be repaired or restored. Your insurer will advise. If your home is uninhabitable while repairs are being carried out your insurer will arrange for, and pay the cost of, any alternative temporary accommodation you may need in line with your policy. Commercial polices will cover damage to premises and stock. Business interruption cover (which may be included or purchased separately) will cover additional trading costs, such as hiring temporary alternative trading premises if necessary. Here is the guidance in full. The downturn in the UK\u2019s construction sector eased last month to the slowest rate of decline since September, according to a survey. A sustained slump in house building was the main factor holding back construction output, which firms linked to elevated interest rates and subdued confidence among clients. The headline purchasing managers\u2019 index, which tracks changes in industry activity, rose to 46.8 in December from 45.5 in November. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction. Improving supply conditions meant delivery times for construction items shortened for the tenth month in a row. Price discounting among suppliers contributed to a moderate fall in average cost burdens across the construction sector at the end of 2023. Tim Moore, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, which compiles the survey said: Construction companies experienced another fall in business activity at the end of 2023 as weak order books meant a lack of new work to replace completed projects. House building was the worst-performing area of construction activity, but even in this segment there were signs that the downturn has started to ease. \u201c Elevated borrowing costs and a subsequent slump in market confidence were the main factors leading to falling sales volumes across the construction sector in the second half of 2023. Survey respondents also continued to cite worries about the broader UK economic outlook, especially in relation to prospects for commercial construction. However, expectations of falling interest rates during the months ahead appear to have supported confidence levels among construction companies. December data indicated that 41% of construction firms predict a rise in business activity over the course of 2024, while only 17% forecast a decline. This contrasted with negative sentiment overall at the same time a year earlier. Industry expert Noble Francis tweeted: The December uptick in eurozone inflation will prove temporary, says Nicola Nobile, chief Italy economist at Oxford Economics. As anticipated by yesterday\u2019s national numbers, eurozone inflation rate increased in December. But this was mainly driven by the energy component. German energy inflation, up to 4% was the main culprit as energy inflation was impacted by a strong base effect from the one-off gas price break in December 2022. Apart from energy, all the other components continued their disinflationary trend. Although some of the components, such as food remain elevated and subject to some volatility, the disinflation dynamic is still quite clear. Food inflation (which also includes alcohol and tobacco) was at 6.1% in December, down from around 10% in the summer. Moreover, the second monthly increase in unprocessed foods inflation was very likely driven by unfavourable weather conditions and hence should soon readjust downwards. Core inflation dropped to 3.4%, from 3.6% in November, driven by a decrease in non-energy industrial goods inflation. Services inflation remained at 4% over the year, but also in this area the monthly dynamic offers some optimism. The 0.7% m/m increase in services inflation is a touch lower than the 2010-2019 average December monthly increase\u2026 Overall, apart from the monthly volatility, this was another encouraging inflation report and further confirms that a quick disinflationary process is underway. But today\u2019s print will not offer any major insights on the ECB easing cycle. We expect that the January inflation print will be much more informative, as large price adjustments typically happen at the start of the year, with this year\u2019s January print also impacted by the end of the energy-related fiscal measures in some countries. We will follow up on this specifically in forthcoming research. Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at ING, said: The increase in headline inflation was mainly driven by energy base effects in Germany. The core inflation rate dropped from 3.6 to 3.4%, indicating that the underlying trend in inflation remains relatively benign for the moment. Food inflation also continued to trend down rapidly. Inflationary pressures made way for disinflation over the course of 2023 as demand weakened and supply shocks faded. This has brought inflation down more than expected at the start of last year. Currently though, base effects from easing supply shocks are moderating and some new inflationary concerns are surfacing. Think of the increased supply chain concerns related to the Red Sea. Besides that, German government measures are also adding to inflation for 2024. The European Central Bank\u2019s mantra has always been that the last leg is the hardest. Is this what we are currently witnessing? Don\u2019t overestimate the inflationary pressures for now though. Demand remains weak, which is a very important disinflationary driver right now. Also, inventories are high, making current supply chain concerns much less inflationary than the ones from 2021. And even though energy price shocks related to the Middle East are a clear risk to the outlook, oil prices are currently still below US$80 per barrel. So overall, the outlook for inflation continues to be quite benign and we expect eurozone inflation to be around 2% again by the end of the year. And what does this mean for interest rates? Current inflationary developments therefore seem to support our view that recent market expectations of a first-quarter hike are premature, but don\u2019t think that we\u2019re back to \u2018higher for longer\u2019 either. We expect the ECB to start cautiously cutting rates from June onwards, with 75bp in total for 2024. Sir Howard Davies, chair of NatWest Group, has caused a bit of a stir with his comments this morning that it\u2019s not \u201cthat difficult\u201d for people to get on the housing ladder. He said on BBC radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that difficult at the moment [to buy a house]. You have to save, and that\u2019s the way it always used to be\u2026 But what we saw in the financial crisis was the risk of having people being able to borrow 100% In order to get onto the property ladder and then suffering severe falls in the equity value of their houses and having to leave and having a bad credit record etc. So there were dangers in very, very easy access to mortgage credit. So I totally recognise that there are people who find it very difficult to start the process. They will have to save more. But that is, I think, inherent in the change in the financial system, as a result of the mistakes that were made in the last global financial crisis and we have to accept we\u2019re still living with that. The number of new cars registered in the UK has jumped by nearly 18% but electric vehicle demand is flatlining, prompting the industry to call for a VAT cut to stimulate sales. Annual figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) on Friday show 1.9m new cars were registered last year, well up on the previous year\u2019s figure of 1.6m and the highest level since the 2.3m registrations of 2019. The increase is a boost for the automotive industry after the pandemic led to supply chain problems and a shortage of vital computer chips that slowed production. Across the year, 315,000 new battery electric vehicles were sold. That was 50,000 more than 2022, but the number being bought as a share of total registrations failed to grow as expected. They represented just 16.5% of the total, slightly down on last year\u2019s 16.6%. Inflation in the eurozone has risen again and could go higher in the coming months, which makes early interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank less likely. Inflation across the 20-nation bloc rose to 2.9% in December from November\u2019s two-year low of 2.4% because of a reduction of government subsidies on gas, electricity and food. The data are in line with the ECB\u2019s expectation that inflation bottomed out in November. The central bank is projecting that price growth will range between 2.5% and 3% through 2024, well above its 2% target, before slowing again next year. However, underlying inflation \u2013 price growth excluding food and energy which tend to be volatile \u2013 eased to 3.4% from 3.6%. The ECB, which next meets on 25 January to discuss monetary policy, pushed back against investor expectations of imminent rate cuts last month. It wants to see wage pressures cool first to ensure infation is on track to fall back to its target. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Finalto Financial Services, said: European stock markets slipped in early trading, pushing the main indices firmly into the red in the first week of trading in 2024 as the data paints a picture of weakening economic activity and higher inflation. Weak PMI data for the euro area was confirmed, whilst German consumer inflation surged higher as energy subsidies faded. German\u2019s inflation hit 3.8% in December, up from 2.3% in Nov. Final inflation data for the Eurozone as a whole is due at 10am, expected up to 3.0% from 2.4%. Meanwhile FOMC minutes earlier this week suggested the Fed is not quite so close to cutting rates; the US 10-year Treasury yield broke above 4%, helping the dollar hit its highest since the middle of December and keeping the pressure on risk assets. Shares in London, Frankfurt and Paris all retreated on Friday morning, with the US jobs report in focus. The Nasdaq notched its fifth straight daily decline on Thursday, whilst the S&amp;P 500 dropped for a fourth session in a row with Apple suffering again on another downgrade. For the week, the FTSE 100 is off about three-quarters of a percent, held up relative to peers with oil firmer, whilst the Dax is down 1.4% and CAC is 2% lower with luxury taking a bit of a bashing on China fears. On the financial markets, stocks are falling while crude oil prices have risen more than 1% amid tensions in the Middle East. Brent crude futures are up 87 cents at $78.46 a barrel while US light crude is 97 cents ahead at $73.16 a barrel. US secretary of state Antony Blinken is heading to the Middle East for a week of diplomacy to try and prevent the Israel-Gaza conflict from widening. You can read more here: Attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen on commercial ships in the Red Sea have also triggered supply concerns. On the stock markets , the FTSE 100 index has fallen nearly 67 points, or 0.9%, to 7,656, as optimism about interest rate cuts fades. Germany\u2019s Dax is down 105 points, or 0.6%, at 16,513 while France\u2019s CAC has lost 66 points, a 0.9% drop to 7,384. Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has shed 184 points, or 0.6%, to 30,221. Sir Howard Davies, who chairs NatWest, has warned that we we could see a \u201crather slow reduction in interest rates\u201d this year because \u201cwage expectations are quite high\u201d. Speaking on radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he explained why lenders have already started to cut mortgage rates in a fierce price war. As financial markets are now expecting a series of rate cuts from the Bank of England this year, therefore you can, as a bank, fix your interest rate at a slightly lower level than you could even a couple of months ago. And it\u2019s that fixing of the rates in the market that determines what we can offer to customers. So the market expectations of rates are falling, therefore, we can pass that on to people who want a new mortgage. He said because the Bank of England was criticised for being slow to raise interest rates when inflation shot up mainly due to higher energy and food prices, policymakers will be careful when they reduce borrowing costs. Even at the last meeting in December, three of the nine members of the [rate-setting] committee still voted for a further increase in rates. So they\u2019re quite a long way away at the moment from a majority in favour of a reduction in rates. And there is a risk of that, having been burned once by reacting too slowly. They are now going to be rather cautious in coming down. It\u2019s likely that we will see a rather slow reduction in rates during the year. They will of course be influenced by what is going on in retail prices, not rising anything like as rapidly as they were, but still wage expectations are quite high and that if you read the recent speeches from the Bank of England, thats what\u2019s worrying them the most. Here\u2019s a lookahead to what 2024 might bring in the housing market: The EY Item Club forecasting group said the 1.1% month-on-month rise in the Halifax measure of house prices in December capped off a year when values proved much more resilient than forecasters had expected. An average of the Halifax and Nationwide measures was down 1.5% in the fourth quarter on a year earlier, in contrast to consensus predictions last January of a fall of 6.5%. Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the group, said: Two factors have led to a modest correction. Firstly, unemployment has remained low. Secondly, the rise in mortgage interest rates has been much more protracted than in the past, reflecting a shift in the mortgage stock from variable to fixed rate. Both factors have kept forced sales down and limited supply. The closing months of 2023 saw a recovery in demand for properties, albeit from a low level. Mortgage approvals in December rose to a six-month high. This was probably aided by falling mortgage rates, as investors have priced in a substantial series of rate cuts by the Bank of England this year. The EY Item Club thinks this recovery should continue as mortgage rates continue to drift down and lower inflation makes for a likely more predictable macroeconomic outlook. The fact that the ratio of house prices to average earnings is down by over a tenth since the 2022 peak, reflecting a fall in prices alongside strong growth in wages, should also support demand. This can cause a lot of stress and sleepless nights. My colleague Jedidajah Otte has talked to homeowners who fear a sharp rise in mortgage payments as they come off fixed-rate deals this year. However, mortgage costs are still much higher than they have been in recent years after the Bank of England raised interest rates to 5.25% to fight stubbornly high inflation. (Financial markets expect it to cut rates to below 4% by the end of the year.) As a result, homeowners are facing a \u00a319bn increase in mortgage costs as millions more fixed-rate deals expire and borrowers are forced to renegotiate their home loans after the toughest round of interest rate increases in decades, writes our economics correspondent Richard Partington. Despite an escalating price war between lenders cutting the cost of remortgaging in recent days, economists at the US investment bank Goldman Sachs said many UK households would still experience a dramatic leap in repayments compared with the deals they were leaving behind. In what has been described as a Tory mortgage timebomb by Rishi Sunak\u2019s critics, just over 1.5m households are expected to reach the end of cheaper deals in 2024 \u2013 with an increase in annual housing costs of about \u00a31,800 for the typical family, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank. As fixed-rate deals expire and households absorb the biggest hit to their finances in the postwar age, with inflation and tax rises taking their toll on spending power, borrowers are turning to a range of measures to cope with the increased costs, from renting out rooms in their homes to drawing down pensions early and even postponing having children. Anthony Codling, housing analyst at RBC Capital markets, said: The demise of the UK housing market is somewhat over reported. The Halifax reported today that house prices rose by 1.7% in 2023, an increase of \u00a34,800. Most, including us, thought house prices would fall during 2023, and most think they will fall in 2024, but not us. With rising wages, falling inflation, falling mortgage rates, and increasing talk of election related housing stimulus packages we expect house prices to rise in 2024. Our pessimism was misplaced in 2023, and we don\u2019t want to make the same mistake twice. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. House prices in the UK rose for the third consecutive month in December, reflecting a shortage of properties on the market, according to mortgage lender Halifax. It added that with mortgage rates easing, confidence among buyers may improve in the coming months. The cost of an average home rose by 1.1% to \u00a3287,105, just over \u00a33,000 more than in November and the highest level since March, Halifax said. This comes after monthly gains of 0.6% and 1.2% in November and October. Compared with December 2022, values were up 1.7%, the first annual growth in eight months, following a 0.8% drop in November. Kim Kinnaird, director of Halifax Mortgages, said: The housing market beat expectations in 2023 and grew by 1.7% on an annual basis. The average property price is now \u00a34,800 higher than it was in December 2022. Whilst it\u2019s encouraging that we saw growth in the last three months of the year, this was preceded with property price falls for six consecutive months between April and September. The growth we have seen is likely being driven by a shortage of properties on the market, rather than the strength of buyer demand. That said, with mortgage rates continuing to ease, we may see an increase in confidence from buyers over the coming months. Across all the UK regions, Northern Ireland recorded the strongest house price growth in 2023, as properties increased in value by 4.1% to \u00a3192,153. Scotland saw property prices increase by 2.6% to \u00a3205,170. At the other end of the scale, the south east fell most sharply, houses there now average \u00a3376,804, a drop of \u00a317,755 or 4.5%. Halifax expects prices to fall by between 2% and 4% this year as many still struggle to afford the sharply higher mortgage costs compared with recent years following a series of Bank of England rate hikes. The question is when will the central bank start cutting rates? Financial markets are betting that the first reduction will come by May. Kinnaird explained: As we move through 2024, the UK property market will continue to reflect the wider economic uncertainty and buyers and sellers are likely to be naturally cautious when considering making a move. While wage growth is now above inflation, helping to ease cost of living pressures for some and improving housing affordability, interest rates are likely to remain elevated for as long as inflation remains markedly above the Bank of England\u2019s target. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: The housing market saw a remarkably strong finish to the year, as buyer and seller confidence was boosted by three consecutive interest rate holds and the growing belief that the next move in rates will be downwards. Increased competitiveness among lenders leads to lower mortgage rates and we find ourselves in the midst of a price war. With HSBC launching the headline-grabbing 3.94% five-year fix and reductions from Halifax, NatWest, TSB and other lenders, the gloves really are off. With 2023 being a disappointing year in terms of amount of business done, lenders are keen to get this year off to a cracking start. Increased competition, rates aside, may also lead to lenders broadening criteria to attract business with longer mortgage terms or greater flexibility to allow certain variable incomes. Although those remortgaging this year will still see an increase in their payments, the pain will not be as bad as it could have been. Later today we will get the US non-farm payrolls report for December, which is expected to show that the economy added 150,00 jobs following November\u2019s 199,000 increase. The Agenda 9.30am GMT: S&amp;P Global/CIPS Construction PMI for December 10am GMT: Eurozone inflation for December (forecast: 2.9%) 1.30pm GMT: US Non-farm payrolls jobs report for December (forecast: 150,000)"

            "date": "2024-01-25T15:05:51Z",
            "content": "European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde has said that policymakers agreed at today\u2019s meeting that talk of interest rate cuts is \u201cpremature\u201d. Last week, she told Bloomberg in Davos that the bank could start cutting rates in the summer. The pace of US economic growth slowed in the last three months of 2023, but far less than had been expected, underlining the continued resilience of the economy. Growth slowed to an annualised rate of 3.3% from 4.9% in the third quarter. The economy grew by 2.5% in 2023, its best performance since 2021. Lloyds Banking Group is cutting around 1,600 jobs across its branch network as it shifts more services online to save money. It will also create around 830 jobs elsewhere in the bank. Britain\u2019s next government faces some of the toughest tax and spending choices for generations as it will be forced to grapple with the impact of weak growth and high debt interest payments, a leading thinktank has said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned that Jeremy Hunt\u2019s much-predicted budget tax cuts risked being reversed or paid for by spending cuts, and urged the Conservative and Labour parties to \u201clevel\u201d with voters before polling day. Our other main stories: Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Bye! \u2013 JK The government and the Bank of England will press ahead with the design of a digital pound without pledging that a \u201cBritcoin\u201d will become available to the British public. Officials at the Bank and the Treasury said a consultation exercise last year showed there was an appetite for a new method of transferring money electronically. Responding to concerns that the Bank and the government would have access to users\u2019 personal data, officials said primary legislation would safeguard digital currency users in the same way bank accounts are protected at the moment. The Treasury said it would also maintain cash in circulation after a strong backlash from among the 50,000 respondents to the consultation, including MPs, who feared paper banknotes and coins would be phased out. More than 40 countries are understood to be pursuing the development of a digital currency that is expected to rival the crypto currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are valued on independent exchanges. Supporters of the scheme, which could be launched before the end of the decade with the Bank acting as the backstop or custodian of the new digital currency, said it will allow innovation in the UK financial services sector, keeping firms in financial centres across the UK at the forefront of a global market place. Critics, including members of the House of Lords economic affairs committee, have said they have \u201cyet to hear a convincing case\u201d for why the UK needs a central bank digital currency (CBDC), while some MPs asked whether the plan is \u201ca solution in search of a problem\u201d. Simon Youel, head of policy and advocacy at research and campaign group Positive Money, said the government needed to respond to the rise of private crypto currencies. The huge response to the consultation highlights the importance of a genuinely inclusive national conversation on the future of our money, which is presently facing a rapid privatisation as cash gets replaced by electronic bank money. Colin Finlayson, fixed income investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, says the ECB may have to start cutting rates earlier than the summer. The ECB kept policy unchanged at 4%, as widely expected. Although Ms Lagarde attempted to push back on the current market expectations of rate-cuts in the coming month, she did have to concede that both underlying inflation and inflation expectations have continued to fall. With the ECB current growth outlook characterised as having risks to the downside, the market paid little attention to her attempts to dampen rate-cut enthusiasm. The ECB are guiding towards the summer at the earliest for any rate cuts to begin but we feel that they may not have the luxury of waiting that long. On the Lloyds job cuts, here is a statement from the bank: As more customers choose to manage their day-to-day banking online, it\u2019s important our people are available when it matters most. We\u2019re introducing a number of new roles and making changes to our branch teams so our customers can see us how and when they want to. Lloyds is cutting 1,600 jobs as part of a shift to more online services but is also creating 830 jobs elsewhere \u2013 \u201cin an expanded relationship growth team \u2013 part of our consumer relationships business \u2013 where colleagues will work to understand our customers\u2019 financial goals and needs and meet them through our products and services\u201d. The Accord union explains the changes in detail on its website: There will be no compulsory role reductions at grades A and B, although grade B colleagues can express an interest in voluntary redundancy. Changes to management structures will mean there will be redundancies at grade C and above. The aim is to achieve most of these reductions through voluntary redundancy. Asked whether she stands by her forecast made in December that the eurozone will avoid recession, Lagarde said the most recent PMI surveys are encouraging for the economy. People can challenge PMI numbers and they do but at least we are seeing numbers that are either to the upside or or stable\u2026 We recognise the weakness of of growth and that weakness obviously applies to Q4. You know there are multiple ways to define what is a recession, the technical terminology, two quarters in a row that that are negative is one way to look at it. I remember discussing that with my colleague and friend Janet Yellen, where the US had two quarters in a row that were negative. And when I said well, Janet, you must be in a recession and she said: \u2018What! With those unemployment numbers, forget it. We are not in recession.\u2019 So I think we have to be attentive to all sorts of data signals and understanding of the economy. This concludes the press conference. Back at the ECB in Frankfurt, chief Christine Lagarde is asked whether her comments mean that a rate cut in April is unlikely. She said: In terms of an overall evaluation of our policy trajectory, which many of you are after, we need to be further along in the disinflation process before we can be sufficiently confident that inflation will actually hit the target in a timely manner and in a sustainable way at target. So it\u2019s a disinflation process in which we are, it is working, but we need to be more advanced. and we need to be further along in that process, to be confident that inflation will be at target sustainably. So I\u2019m giving you a little indication about what I call the trajectory, but it\u2019s not forward guidance, it\u2019s trying to give you the mechanics that we will apply in our considerations when we look at data in the next few weeks. Just in: Lloyds Banking Group is cutting around 1,600 jobs across its branch network as it shifts more services online to save money. It will also create around 830 jobs elsewhere in the bank. Banks are keen to cut costs amid tough economic conditions and pressure on profit margins from competition and peaking interest rates. Rival Barclays also slashed thousands of jobs last year, with the majority in the bank\u2019s back office support division. Lagarde also said the ECB is keeping a close eye on developments in the Red Sea, where attacks on ships by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have led to ships being rerouted, and concerns about shipping delays and higher costs, which could push inflation up. We are observing very carefully because we are seeing that shipping costs are increasing, delivery delays are increasing. And while we all know that there is more shipping capacity than there was in in 2020 and 2021, we also know that costs and fees are increasing. The Q&amp;A has started. The first question is whether the governing council discussed a rate cut at today\u2019s meeting. Lagarde said: The consensus around the table of the Governing Council was that it was premature to discuss rate cuts. One other thing, which was very much a consensus around the table was that we had to continue to be data dependent. Lagarde summed up the risks to inflation: Upside risks to inflation include the heightened geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term, and hamper global trade. Inflation could also turn out higher than anticipated if wage wages increase by more than expected or profit margins prove more resilient by contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampens demand by more than expected or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsens unexpectedly. Moreover, inflation could decline more quickly in the near term if energy prices evolve in line with the recent downward shift in market expectations of the future path for oil and gas prices. Turning to inflation, ECB president Christine Lagarde said: Inflation is expected to ease further over the course of this year as the effects of past energy shocks, supply bottlenecks and the post pandemic reopening of the economy fade and tighter monetary policy continues to weigh on demand. Almost all measures of underlying inflation declined further in December. The elevated rate of wage increases and falling labour productivity are keeping domestic price pressures high, although these two have started to ease. And the growth outlook: Looking now at the risk assessment, the risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. Growth could be lower if the effects of monetary policy turn out stronger than expected. A weaker world economy or a further slowdown in global trade would also weigh on euro area growth. Russia\u2019s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East are key sources of geopolitical risks. This may result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted. Growth could be higher if rising real incomes mean spending increases by more than anticipated or if the world economy grows more strongly than expected. The pace of US economic growth slowed in the last three months of 2023, but far less than had been expected, underlining the continued resilience of the economy. The commerce department reported on Thursday that US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of economic health \u2013 grew at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the final quarter of the year, down from 4.9% in the previous quarter but in line with pre-pandemic growth, and well ahead of the 2% economists had expected. Robust consumer spending and government outlays contributed to the growth. The Federal Reserve has been attempting to cool economic activity in order to bring down inflation. Since March 2022 the Fed has increased rates to a 22-year high and held them there. Inflation has fallen from a high of 9% in June 2022 to 3.4%. The rate rises have increased the cost of borrowing and many \u2013 including the Fed \u2013 had expected a subsequent slowdown in economic activity to lead to layoffs. But so far the Fed appears to be on course for what it has termed a \u201csoft landing\u201d. Hiring has remained robust \u2013 unemployment hovers at close to a 50-year low \u2013 and while growth has slowed, consumers have continued to spend, the US economy has weathered the rate rises and stock markets have hit record highs. \u201cThe Fed \u2013 so far \u2013 has managed to strangle inflation without strangling the economy,\u201d said Dan North, senior economist with Allianz Trade Americas. North said the Fed rate rises were still working their way through the economy and he expected 2024 to be a year of slow growth \u201cbut we are not using the recession word yet.\u201d European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde has kicked off the press conference with a statement on the economy. Looking at the economic activity, the euro area economy is likely to have stagnated in the final quarter of \u201823. The incoming data continue to signal weakness in the near term. However, some forward looking server indicators point to a pickup in growth further ahead. The labour market has remained robust. The unemployment rate at 6.4% in November has fallen back to its lowest level since the start of the euro and more workers have entered the labour force. The US economy expanded more than expected in the fourth quarter, powered by consumer spending. GDP rose at a 3.3% annualised rate, according to the government\u2019s preliminary estimate, down from 4.9% in the previous quarter. This compares with market forecasts of 2.2% growth. In 2023, the economy expanded by 2.5%, its strongest performance since 2021. ECB president Christine Lagarde will hold a press conference at 1.45pm GMT. You can watch it here. The European Central Bank\u2019s governing council has kept interest rates unchanged, as expected. The ECB\u2019s rate on its main refinancing operations, which provide the bulk of liquidity to the banking system, is at 4.5%. Its deposit rate, which is paid on commercial bank deposits, is at 4%. The marginal lending facility, which offers overnight credit to banks, is at 4.75%. The central bank explained: The incoming information has broadly confirmed its previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook. Aside from an energy-related upward base effect on headline inflation, the declining trend in underlying inflation has continued, and the past interest rate increases keep being transmitted forcefully into financing conditions. Tight financing conditions are dampening demand, and this is helping to push down inflation. Ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s interest rate decision at 1.15pm GMT, Germany\u2019s 10-year bond yield rose to its highest level since early December. Germany\u2019s 10-year yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, touched a high of 2.371% earlier. Yields move inversely to prices. The central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged but investors will be looking for any hints on when borrowing costs will start to come down. The ECB\u2019s deposit rate, which is paid on commercial bank deposits, was last raised in September to 4% \u2013 the highest since the euro was launched in 1999. The rate on its main refinancing operations, which provide the bulk of liquidity to the banking system, is at 4.5%. The marginal lending facility, which offers overnight credit to banks, is at 4.75%. Jeroen Blokland, founder of Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund, tweeted: On the markets, shares are drifting lower while oil prices have risen and the pound is little changed. The FTSE 100 index is trading 14 points, or 0.2%, lower at 7,513. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 0.4%, while France\u2019s CAC is down 0.45% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has slid nearly 1% ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s interest rate decision. In the oil market, Brent crude, the global benchmark, is $1.07 higher at $81.10 a barrel, a 1.3% gain. US light crude has gained $1.11 to $76.2 a barrel, up 1.5%. Oil prices rallied after data showed US crude stockpiles fell more than expected last week, and the Chinese central bank\u2019s cut in banks\u2019 reserve requirements (the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve) raised hopes of more economic stimulus to kickstart the economy. Retail sales across the UK fell at the fastest pace in three years this month, according to an industry survey. The Confederation of British Industry\u2019s monthly retail sales balance, which measures sales volumes versus a year ago, fell to -50 in January from -32 in December, the weakest since December 2021 when Britain was in a Covid-19 lockdown. The balance measures the number of retailers who said sales volumes rose minus those who said sales fell. February won\u2019t be much better, the survey suggests. The volume of sales for this time of the year was -47, the lowest reading since May 2020. Martin Sartorius, the CBI\u2019s principal economist, said: Looking ahead, demand conditions in the sector will remain challenging as higher interest rates continue to feed through to mortgage payments and household incomes. Official figures published last week showed British retailers suffered the biggest drop in sales for almost three years in December, raising the risk that the economy slipped into recession late last year. Domino\u2019s Pizza shares have dived, wiping more than $1.5bn from the company\u2019s market value. A trifecta of problems facing the international operations of Domino\u2019s Pizza Enterprises sparked a 30% plunge in the share price of the Australian-owned company on Thursday. Domino\u2019s, which holds the branding rights in several countries of the American pizza chain, disclosed that net profit before tax for the recent six-month period was expected to be between $87m and $90m, down from almost $105m a year earlier. The shareholder response to the trading update was ruthless. Managing director Don Meij convened a call with analysts and investors, and sought to explain the troubles. \u201cIt\u2019s quite humbling to sit in front of you and to be able to share the disappointing results in part of our business today,\u201d he said on the video conference. \u201cIt really shows a rollercoaster.\u201d Norway\u2019s central bank has kept its benchmark interest rate at 4.5%, as expected, and said the cost of borrowing was likely to stay at that level \u201cfor some time ahead\u201d. The economic prospects for Norway do not appear to have changed materially since December, Norges Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee said. Norges Bank\u2019s governor Ida Wolden Bache said: The committee assesses that the policy rate is now sufficiently high to return inflation to target within a reasonable time horizon. Monetary policy is having a tightening effect, and the economy is cooling down. At the same time, business costs have increased considerably in recent years, and continued high wage growth and the crown depreciation through 2023 will likely restrain disinflation. In December, the central bank raised rates in a surprise move, even though inflation had slowed. Norway\u2019s core inflation was 5.5% in December, a 15-month low, down from a peak of 7% last June, but still above the central bank\u2019s 2% target. Economists are expecting a rate cut between July and September and another one in the final three months of 2024, which would bring the benchmark rate down to 4% by the end of the year. In the UK, the bike and car parts retailer Halfords said sales in December were much weaker than in October and November. It explained that mild and wet weather affected demand for winter products and brought fewer people into its stores, while cash-strapped customers reined in spending in the run-up to Christmas. Sales of car products fell 15.3% in December, after averaging 10.2% in October and November on a like-for-like basis (at stores open at least a year). However in January sales growth returned to those levels as conditions normalised, Halfords said. Group revenues grew by 2% in the 13 weeks to 29 December. However, cycling and consumer tyres were \u201cperforming significantly worse than anticipated and have weakened in Q3\u201d. Sales of bikes and accessories slid 1.2% in the quarter. Halfords said it performed better than the cycling market as a whole, with kids bikes sales up 5% in December. Volumes in the cycling and consumer tyres markets are below pre-pandemic levels by 28% and 14% respectively. The company is cutting costs of \u00a335m this year, more than previously flagged, and announced a partnership with the specialist tyre distributor Bond International. Graham Stapleton, the chief executive, said: Trading in Q4 has begun strongly and we remain focused on everything that we can control, with a number of initiatives underway to achieve further efficiencies within the business, as well as investing in areas where we see real opportunities for future growth. In German manufacturing, business expectations improved but remained pessimistic. Order books continue to shrink, albeit less rapidly than at the end of the year. The business climate in the service sector clouded over considerably while in trade, the index fell to its lowest level since October 2022. In construction, the business climate index also continued to slide. In Germany, business confidence worsened in January, as Europe\u2019s biggest economy remains weak. The closely watched business climate index from the Munich-based Ifo institute fell to 85.2 from 86.3 in December. The institute\u2019s president Clemens Fuest said: Companies assessed their current situation as worse. Their expectations for the months ahead were also once again more pessimistic. The German economy is stuck in recession. Technically, Germany dodged a recession at the end of last year (defined by two or more consecutive quarters of contraction). In the final quarter of last year, the German economy shrank by 0.3%, compared with the previous quarter, when output flatlined. But the economy contracted by 0.3% in 2023 and is on track for its first two-year recession since the early 2000s amid the impact of higher energy costs and weaker industrial demand. The boss of the London estate agents Foxtons, Guy Gittins, hailed a \u201ctransformational year\u201d following a turnaround plan, as it reported higher overall revenues and profits, although revenues in its sales business continued to slide. Sales revenues fell by 14% last year from 2022 while the market slumped by 22%, according to Foxtons. It said it has gone into 2024 with an under-offer pipeline far ahead of last year and expects year-on-year sales revenue growth in the first quarter, and further growth through the year. Things have improved in recent weeks. The firm explained: Buyer demand has grown as mortgage rates have begun to normalise, with good levels of growth seen in recent weeks as the first mortgage products are released with rates below 4% since the September 2022 mini-budget. Any sustained reduction in interest rates is expected to spur significant further growth in buyer demand. Total revenues rose 5% to \u00a3147m last year while adjusted operating profit edged higher to \u00a314m from \u00a313.9m. Gittins, the chief executive, has invested in the lettings business, which makes up 70% of group revenues and grew by 16%, delivering more than \u00a3100m revenue for the first time. In bad news for tenants, \u201crents are expected to stabilise and remain at historically elevated levels.\u201d Gittins, who returned to Foxtons (where he started his career) in September 2022 after running rival Chestertons, said: 2023 has been a transformational year for Foxtons, following the implementation of a refreshed strategy and operational turnaround plan. We have delivered a year of market share growth and have ended the year with revenue and adjusted operating profit ahead of market expectations; our operational upgrades and investment in fee earners, training, data and brand, coupled with a return to driving innovation in the industry, are now consistently delivering material benefits to our competitiveness and market positioning, helping us to end 2023 as the UK\u2019s fastest growing large lettings and sales agency brand. Dr Martens has been hit by lower sales in the US, as cash-strapped consumers refused to splash out for Christmas. The British bootmaker said sales made directly to customers fell 3% in the three months to the end of December, its third quarter, and wholesale revenues tumbled 46%. Overall group revenues were down 18%. The company, which was founded in 1960 in Northamptonshire, is still expecting a decline of nearly 10% over the full year (\u201chigh single-digit percentage\u201d). Kenny Wilson, the chief executive, said: This was driven by a weak USA performance, as expected. Trading in the quarter was volatile and we saw a softer December in line with trends across the industry. Whilst the consumer environment remains challenging, we are taking action to continue to grow our iconic brand and invest in our business. Labour will use its sold-out business conference next week to unveil the party\u2019s City policy plans, the Guardian can reveal, as it tries to win over hundreds of UK executives before a general election. More than 500 bosses from across British finance will gather in London on 1 February for the event, where opposition leaders including Sir Keir Starmer, his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and the shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, plan to \u201cshowcase Labour\u2019s offer to business\u201d. The party is hoping that the conference \u2013 which sold out within two hours in the autumn \u2013 will demonstrate its \u201ccommitment to work hand in glove with the business community\u201d and will use it as an opportunity to reveal its business policy plans after two major industry reviews. The Guardian understands that will include Labour\u2019s much-anticipated strategy for the City and will detail how the party plans to harness the strength of the UK\u2019s \u00a3275bn financial and professional services sector. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial market and the world economy. The next UK government will face the toughest tax and spending decisions in 70 years, according to a leading think tank. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said a combination of high interest rates and weak growth means whoever wins the general election later this year will find it \u201cmore difficult to reduce debt as a fraction of national income than in any parliament since at least the 1950s.\u201d It warned that Jeremy Hunt\u2019s much-predicted budget tax cuts \u2013 he will unveil the budget on 6 March \u2013 risk being reversed or paid for by spending cuts, and urged the Conservative and Labour parties to \u201clevel\u201d with voters before polling day. Chinese stocks rallied after a cut in Chinese bank reserve requirements, releasing about a trillian yuan for lending (nearly \u00a3111bn). The Shanghai Composite rose 3%, after hitting a four-year low on Monday, and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was up 2% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei was little changed. Investors have been selling Chinese equities for months, amid worries about the sluggish economy and the country\u2019s property crisis. The European Central Bank is meeting today and will announce its interest rate decision at lunchtime. It is not expected to change its main interest rate of 4.5%. Minutes from the December meeting showed policymakers were pushing back on aggressive market expectations for rate cuts, and ECB president Christine Lagarde is likely to face questions on their timing during the press conference. Last week, she said the central bank could cut rates in the summer, during an interview with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Zero growth in the single currency zone in the final quarter of last year followed a 0.1% economic contraction in the third quarter, meaning that recession \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 was just averted. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the eurozone\u2019s economy to shrink by 0.1% in the fourth quarter. The eurozone\u2019s two biggest economies both performed poorly in late 2023, with Germany contracting by 0.3% and France posting no growth for a second successive quarter, according to Eurostat, the EU\u2019s statistical agency. There was better news from the other two members of the eurozone\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d. Italy, which had been expected to stagnate, recorded growth of 0.2%, while Spain expanded by 0.6% \u2013 three times the 0.2% forecast. Of the smaller eurozone economies, Portugal grew by 0.8% in the final quarter, Austria expanded by 0.2%, while Ireland\u2019s economy contracted by 0.7% \u2013 its fourth successive quarterly fall in 2023. Eurostat said that the broader 27-nation European Union also posted no growth in the fourth quarter. From the fourth quarter of 2022 and the final quarter of 2023, the eurozone expanded by just 0.1%, while the EU grew by 0.2%. \u201cThe eurozone economy escaped recession by the skin of its teeth by the end of 2023,\u201d Diego Iscaro, head of Europe economics at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said. \u201cThe outlook for 2024 continues to be challenging amid faltering demand and increasing geopolitical tensions.\u201d The eurozone\u2019s stagnating economy will further pressurethe European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the countries in the monetary union, to start cutting borrowing costs. Bert Colijn, a senior economist at ING bank, said: \u201cA technical recession has just been avoided in the eurozone. Still, the eurozone economy has now been broadly stagnating since late 2022 and has lost substantial ground to the US in terms of GDP in recent years. After the buoyant post-pandemic reopening phase, the economy has now entered a phase of prolonged weakness.\u201d Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago, the eurozone has been struggling to cope with higher energy and food prices, and the damage caused to business and consumer confidence. The ECB raised interest rates last year to their highest level since the euro was launched in 1999. Nicola Mai, economist at asset manager Pimco, said: \u201cDespite a resilient early start in 2023, the eurozone economy was weak through much of the year, and we anticipate that this fragility will persist in 2024. \u201cThe reasons for this ongoing weakness are clear. Europe is still recovering from a lingering energy shock and has not experienced the same degree of fiscal stimulus as the more resilient US economy in recent years. The region\u2019s shorter debt maturities also mean that interest rate hikes have been felt more quickly.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-18T20:16:39Z",
            "content": "An envelope containing fentanyl was mailed to an elections office in northern California, where a worker was exposed to the drug, officials said on Wednesday. The elections department in Yuba county, a rural area about 40 miles from Sacramento, the state capital, received the package on Tuesday. It appeared to come from a \u201cverified agency\u201d and did not initially look suspicious, a county spokesperson said. A staff member found a powdery substance inside and contacted law enforcement. An initial test showed the presence of fentanyl, but further analysis will be conducted to confirm the results. \u201cWe are grateful that no one was harmed in this incident and we will continue to exercise caution as we perform the important work of conducting elections,\u201d Donna Hillegass, the Yuba county elections clerk-recorder, said in a statement. In November, suspicious packages, including some containing fentanyl, were mailed to elections facilities in at least five states, including offices in Sacramento and Los Angeles. This week\u2019s incident prompted the office of California\u2019s secretary of state to issue an advisory to county election officials across the state with guidance on safety protocols. \u201cI am relieved that nobody was harmed,\u201d Shirley Weber, the state\u2019s top voting official, said in a statement. \u201cThe response of the Yuba county registrar\u2019s team and sheriff\u2019s office minimized potential harm and ensured my office could provide immediate guidance to the state\u2019s 57 other counties.\u201d US elections offices across the US have faced years of threats and harassment since 2020, as Donald Trump and his supporters have falsely claimed the presidency was stolen from him and have tried to cast doubt on the integrity of America\u2019s elections. In California, the threats have often been concentrated in small rural counties. Nevada county, just east of Yuba, increased its security budget in 2022 after a wave of harassment. The county counsel there sought out a restraining order against residents who pushed their way into the elections office and threatened an official. The elections office in Shasta county, a region of 180,000 people in the state\u2019s far north that has risen to national prominence for its far-right politics and thriving election denier movement, has dealt with particularly intense intimidation and threats. Election skeptics have frequently grilled staffers about perceived issues, while rowdy observers seeking to prevent \u201cfraud\u201d have interfered with elections processing, and far-right officials have falsely claimed county elections are \u201cmanipulated\u201d. The Shasta elections office has taken additional safety measures and had security guards and sheriff\u2019s deputies present as staff processed ballots in November\u2019s election. \u201cTen years ago I never thought I\u2019d have to strategize how to protect my staff,\u201d Cathy Darling Allen, the county\u2019s registrar of voters, told the Guardian in November. Many US elections offices have taken steps to enhance building security and increase protections for workers. Some have started stocking up on naloxone, the antidote to fentanyl, in the aftermath of the packages mailed out around the last election. The November letters prompted evacuations and delayed the counting of ballots in some states. The FBI and US Postal Inspection Service intercepted some packages, including letters intended for offices in Sacramento and Los Angeles. The secretary of state in Washington, where four offices were evacuated after receiving envelopes, has warned that elections officials face \u201congoing and constant\u201d threats. \u201cI see this as a prelude to 2024, and I also view this as a domestic terrorist event,\u201d Steve Hobbs said in an interview with Politico. The Yuba county sheriff\u2019s department is investigating Wednesday\u2019s incident. The county said workers recently received training on how to identify and handle suspicious packages and that the office has naloxone on hand. \u201cI trust that law enforcement authorities will identify and bring to justice any persons responsible for seeking to intimidate, threaten, or harm election workers,\u201d Weber said in a statement.

            "date": "2024-01-05T18:17:31Z",
            "content": "Like so many voters around the world, Taiwan\u2019s have put the economy at the top of their agenda. Yet when they go to the polls on 13 January to elect a new president and legislature, those day-to-day concerns will sit alongside the existential question of Taiwan\u2019s future. The island has enjoyed de facto independence since the defeated Kuomintang (KMT) fled there at the end of its civil war with the Communist party. But China claims sovereignty over it and has never ruled out using force to bring it into the fold. It has intensified its rhetoric and its economic and military pressure since the incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen, of the Democratic Progressive party (DPP) won power in 2016. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has sharpened concerns about Taiwan\u2019s fate. In his new year address, Xi Jinping reiterated that \u201creunification of the motherland is a historical inevitability\u201d. Ms Tsai is rare as a female leader in Asia who does not come from a political dynasty. She has steered Taiwan through the troubled waters of US-China relations deftly, as well as overseeing an impressive response to the pandemic. Taiwan also became the first place in Asia to legalise gay marriage on her watch. As she steps down at the two-term limit, her vice-president, William Lai, is the frontrunner to replace her \u2013 but not by much. He once declared himself a \u201cpragmatic worker for Taiwan independence\u201d and the rival KMT has sought to portray his party as risk-takers who could drag Taiwan into war by provoking Beijing. But Mr Lai has worked hard to reposition himself and reassure the US that he will not upset the status quo. He has adhered to the established DPP line that Taiwan need not declare independence because it is already independent \u2013 while suggesting the KMT could make concessions endangering its sovereignty and democracy. For many voters, their biggest gripes with the DPP are low wages, high housing costs and poor public services. Mr Lai\u2019s good fortune is that they don\u2019t think much of the alternatives. The KMT\u2019s Hou Yu-ih and third candidate Ko Wen-je of the Taiwan People\u2019s party tried to cut a deal but ended up in a humiliating public spat instead. Mr Ko, who initially attracted people disenchanted with the DPP but unwilling to back the KMT, has proved erratic and unimpressive. Whatever the outcome, Taiwan\u2019s election should be applauded. As authoritarianism advances across much of Asia, its vigorous debate and free and fair elections are a beacon for a better way of doing things. Beijing has made it clear that it would dish out punishment for a third DPP term, perhaps targeting a cross-straits trade deal as well as stepping up military activity. It would probably throw a KMT government a bone or two. But its determination to control Taiwan\u2019s future would not be lessened; and a political pathway to unification looks still more remote since the crackdown in Hong Kong. The next president of Taiwan is likely to shape events less through proactive measures than his response to circumstances he cannot dictate: a crisis such as a military manoeuvre gone wrong, or more broadly, China\u2019s internal politics, its military strength and \u2013 critically \u2013 its relations with Washington. Ultimately, as voters know, next weekend\u2019s contest is likely to be less consequential in geopolitical terms than this year\u2019s US presidential race and its ultimate winner.

            "title": "Hope of end to actors\u2019 charity row dashed after elections suspended",
            "date": "2024-01-17T20:28:55Z",
            "content": "Hopes of an immediate resolution to the bitter and long-running dispute at the top of a high-profile actors\u2019 charity have been dashed after elections to form a new ruling council were dramatically suspended amid concerns over voting. The Actors\u2019 Benevolent Fund (ABF) said on Wednesday evening that its annual general meeting had been adjourned after votes had been cast and counted but before results were announced, after unspecified concerns were raised about online votes. The ABF has been riven by a public row between a group of trustees ousted in 2022, who are headed by the To the Manor Born actor Dame Penelope Keith, and a cohort of \u201cmodernising\u201d trustees who replaced them in a process which has been challenged as to its compliance with charity law. More than 100 of the ABF\u2019s 750 members turned up in person to vote at the AGM at London\u2019s Soho theatre, hoping that the elections might end a costly feud that has torn apart the charity. But the meeting was adjourned by its independent chair, the veteran arts administrator Luke Rittner, after questions emerged about the numbers of votes cast online. The ABF refused to give any further details of the concerns raised. In a joint statement the ABF, current trustees and candidates standing for election said: \u201cAll parties are dismayed that the results of the vote could not be announced at the AGM. The meeting has been adjourned until 29 January while concerns over online voting are investigated. \u201cThis is clearly disappointing for the ABF\u2019s membership and we are moving at speed to achieve a resolution.\u201d The ABF, which has assets of about \u00a340m, operates hardship funds to support actors and stagehands in England and Wales who need financial or medical help. Its patron is King Charles, and famous past presidents include Sir Laurence Olivier and Sir John Gielgud. The fund gave \u00a3900,000 in hardship grants to 430 beneficiaries in 2022. Eighteen candidates stood for 12 seats on the ABF council. Twelve were marked on the ballot paper as \u201crecommended\u201d by an independent nominations committee because of their skills, experience and apparent suitability; a further six were classed as \u201cother\u201d candidates. The recommended slate included five existing trustees including the current chair, the actor Esh Alladi, as well as a number of aspiring new trustees including the Four Weddings and a Funeral actor Simon Callow, Rob Rinder, from the TV courtroom show Judge Rinder, and the Birds of a Feather sitcom star Lesley Joseph. The \u201cother\u201d group of candidates included the Cold Feet actor Robert Bathurst, who trained as a lawyer and served as an ABF trustee from 2018 to 2021, and the Harry Potter star Miriam Margolyes, who has previously accused the ABF board of treating Keith with contempt. Keith and her supporters argued that their removal in February 2022 breached company law and that the trustee board that replaced them was therefore illegitimate. Legal skirmishes and public wars of words followed while mediation failed; the ousted trustees claimed they were open to talks, but were ignored. One trustee has told the Guardian privately that reform at the top of the ABF had been necessary to inject fresh energy into the charity, make it more democratic, and refocus its resources more tightly on new services for struggling actors, such as talking therapy and cost of living grants. The ousted trustees \u2013 several of whom are in their 80s \u2013 are furious at claims they were out of touch, saying they had developed their own modernising strategy for the ABF. They have in turn suggested that their critics have been guilty of age discrimination and accused them of acting dishonourably. The charities regulator, the Charity Commission, was called in to supervise the ABF two years ago but now finds itself sucked into the controversy amid criticism that it had inappropriately sided with the \u201cousting\u201d trustees and failed to uphold the rule of law as it tried to resolve what it has called a \u201ccostly and damaging dispute\u201d. Last week the commission, in a rare public admission of fault, admitted in a review of its handling of the case that it had made a series of errors, had treated Keith unfairly, and was wrong to be seen to take sides in the dispute. But it offered no apology or remedy to the ousted trustees and may yet face legal challenge."

            "title": "French PM \u00c9lisabeth Borne quits as Macron seeks boost before EU elections",
            "date": "2024-01-08T18:01:56Z",
            "content": "France\u2019s prime minister, \u00c9lisabeth Borne, has resigned after days of increasingly feverish speculation about an imminent government reshuffle. The president, Emmanuel Macron, who is seeking to give a new impetus to his second mandate before European parliament elections and the Paris Olympics this summer, thanked Borne for her \u201cexemplary work in the service of the nation\u201d. \u201cYou have put our project into effect with the courage, engagement and the determination of a stateswoman,\u201d Macron tweeted. In her resignation letter, Borne said it was \u201cmore necessary than ever to continue the reforms\u201d being pursued by the government. \u201cI wanted to tell you how passionate I have been about this mission,\u201d she wrote, adding that she was \u201cguided by the constant concern, which we share, to achieve rapid and tangible results for our fellow citizens\u201d. Nevertheless, she made it clear the decision to go had not been hers and that she had taken note of the president\u2019s wish to appoint a new prime minister. Under the French system, the president appoints the prime minister but cannot dismiss them from the post. Instead, they must ask for their resignation. The reshuffle comes five months before the European parliament elections, with Eurosceptics expected to make record gains at a time of widespread public discontent over surging living costs and the failure of European governments to curb immigration. Opinion polls show Macron\u2019s party trailing that of the far-right leader Marine Le Pen byeight to 10 points before the June vote. Borne, 62, was appointed prime minister in May 2022, shortly after Macron was re-elected to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e. She was the second female prime minister since the Fifth Republic began in 1958. Weeks later the government lost its absolute majority in the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale in a general election. It meant Borne, as head of a minority government, was forced to push contested legislation promised in Macron\u2019s presidential campaign, including an overhaul of the pension system, through parliament often with recourse to a controversial constitutional clause, the 49:3, that avoided a vote on the issues. Borne\u2019s government used the clause 23 times. A fiercely contested immigration bill was passed after Borne sought a compromise with the rightwing R\u00e9publicains party that pushed the legislation further to the right than the government had wished. Borne, who described herself as a \u201cwoman of the left\u201d, found herself under fire from opposite sides of the political spectrum. On Monday, Cyrielle Chatelain, the president of the Ecologist group of MPs, suggested Borne had been a puppet prime minister. \u201cShe has served Emmanuel Macron to the point of losing herself. She wanted to serve the state. Instead, she will have served a president with no direction, no values, who has only one obsession: destroying our social model,\u201d Chatelain tweeted. Borne, a graduate of the elite grandes \u00e9coles, including \u00c9cole Polytechnique, served as transport minister, ecological transition minister and employment minister before being named as prime minister. At the time of her resignation, no successor had been named and the \u00c9lys\u00e9e confirmed that Borne, along with other members of the government, would continue the work on \u201ccurrent issues until the nomination of a new government\u201d. Three names were being put forward in the French media as likely successors: Gabriel Attal, the education minister, who if appointed at the age of 34 would be France\u2019s youngest and first openly gay prime minister; S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, the armed forces minister; and Julien Denormandie, the former agriculture minister who announced he was leaving politics after he was not appointed prime minister after the 2022 presidential election. Earlier in the day, Macron appeared on fighting form as he urged French people to get out and exercise daily as the country prepares to host the Olympic and Paralympic Games. In a video posted on X Macron appeared in front of a punch bag with a pair of boxing gloves slung over his shoulder, suggesting people should work out for 30 minutes every day \u201cand longer if you can\u201d. \u201cIn 200 days it starts. Sport is a great national cause this year,\u201d Macron said. The president, 46, regularly boxes in a gym, alongside his bodyguards, and has been photographed, in official shirt and tie, sparring with amateur boxers."

            "title": "Dutch Caribbean islanders sue Netherlands over climate change",
            "date": "2024-01-11T13:00:19Z",
            "content": "Eight people from the Caribbean island of Bonaire are suing the Netherlands, accusing it of violating their human rights by not doing enough to protect them from the climate crisis. The group, with Greenpeace Netherlands, filed a formal legal challenge against the Dutch government in The Hague on Thursday, asking the district court to order it to cut its greenhouse emissions much more quickly and to help its most vulnerable territories adapt to the impact of the climate crisis. Located nearly 8,000km (about 5,000 miles) from the capital of the Netherlands, Bonaire has been a Dutch special municipality since 2010. But the Netherlands has been present on the island for about 400 years, and in 2022, the government apologised for enslaving its people. As a low-lying island, Bonaire is likely to experience serious consequences from climate change, including extreme weather and sea-level rise. An October report from the Dutch meteorological institute (KNMI) found that temperatures in the Caribbean Netherlands had already increased by about 0.2C every decade since the 1980s. Rainfall is declining, particularly in the dry season. Experts expect this to worsen if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. Onnie Emerenciana, a farmer living on Bonaire and one of the plaintiffs, said it was already becoming increasingly difficult to grow crops because of the growing heat, wind and unpredictable rain. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming very, very, very hard to plant.\u201d The KNMI report concludes that climate policy that focuses on reducing emissions can make a big difference to the future of Dutch Caribbean islands such as Bonaire. Research by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, commissioned by Greenpeace, shows sea-level rise is likely to permanently submerge parts of the island by 2050, a problem exacerbated by the loss of coral reefs as a natural buffer against the oceans warming and acidifying. The studies also concluded that the climate crisis would exacerbate health problems on the island and could ruin its cultural heritage and tourism industry. Bonaire is a popular diving destination, and the degradation of coral reefs could lead to the loss of the majority of dive sites, which it is estimated will reduce visitor numbers by more than 100,000. The group of islanders, most of whom still live on Bonaire and are Dutch citizens, want the Netherlands to tighten its climate goals, so it contributes its \u201cfair share\u201d to keep global heating below 1.5C above preindustrial levels, which would involve reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 \u2013 10 years earlier than its current target. They also want solid plans, developed with the islands\u2019 inhabitants, to protect Bonaire from the consequences of the climate emergeency, to ensure that islanders can continue to live there, and pass on their traditions and culture to their children. Not doing this, they argue, is a breach of their human rights, particularly their right to life, and respect for private and family life. Eefje de Kroon, the climate justice expert at Greenpeace Netherlands who is working on the case, noted that the Netherlands is known for its advanced water-management strategies on the mainland, but the government has done very little to study how the climate crisis will affect its Caribbean outposts and how they could be protected. The national adaptation strategy excludes the islands completely. The group sent a pre-litigation \u201cletter before action\u201d to the Dutch government last May, hoping to resolve the issue without going to court. In an official response in October, the Dutch finance secretary, Alexandra Carla van Huffelen, said the state shared the islanders\u2019 concerns but maintained that the country\u2019s existing climate targets were appropriate, noting that they were tightened last summer. On adaptation, van Huffelen said a substantial amount of research had already taken place but would benefit from a clear overview that was more accessible to the public. She said a climate plan would be developed for each of the Caribbean Netherlands BES islands this year, informed by a \u201cclimate table\u201d led by islanders as recommended by an advisory report. It has allocated \u20ac1m (about \u00a3861,000) to this project. The plaintiffs have held discussions with ministers but were not satisfied, saying the government had failed to make any concrete changes. Social worker Danique Martis said the Caribbean Netherlands have been forgotten for too long. \u201cIt saddens me to see how, despite knowing their responsibility, the Dutch government has chosen to push our right to safety aside. For this reason, we are going to the court, so they have no choice but to act.\u201d De Kroon said the threat of the lawsuit had already begun to change the government\u2019s approach and raised the profile of the issue. As well as helping Bonaire, she hopes that a positive ruling would benefit those living on other Dutch Caribbean islands. The lawsuit is the latest in a wave of climate litigation in the Netherlands and around the world. In 2019, the Dutch government lost the landmark Urgenda case when the country\u2019s supreme court found it had explicit duties to protect its citizens\u2019 human rights in the face of the climate emergency and was required to undertake at least its fair share in cutting global emissions. This latest case seeks to build on that ruling and show that the country has legal responsibilities to all of its territories. Like other climate lawsuits, such as that brought by Torres Strait islanders (also known as the Zenadth Kes) against Australia, it highlights the particular vulnerability of island communities. \u2022 The subheading of this article was amended on 12 January 2024. An earlier version said that research shows part of the island will be submerged by 2025 instead of 2050."

            "content": "A third of UK teenagers believe climate change is \u201cexaggerated\u201d, a report has found, as YouTube videos promoting a new kind of climate denial aimed at young people proliferate on the platform. Previously, most climate deniers pushed the belief that climate breakdown was not happening or, if it was, that humans were not causing it. Now, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) has found that most climate denial videos on YouTube push the idea that climate solutions do not work, climate science and the climate movement are unreliable, or that the effects of global heating are beneficial or harmless. Researchers from the CCDH gathered a dataset of text transcripts from 12,058 climate-related YouTube videos posted by 96 channels over almost six years from 1 January 2018 to 30 September 2023. They also included the results of a nationally representative survey conducted by polling company Survation which found 31% of UK respondents aged 13 to 17 agreed with the statement \u201cClimate change and its effects are being purposefully overexaggerated\u201d. This rose to 37% of teenagers categorised as heavy users of social media, meaning they reported using any one platform for more than four hours a day. The report published on Tuesday shows a shift from the \u201cold denial\u201d \u2013 that climate change is not happening or not anthropogenic \u2013 to the \u201cnew denial\u201d. These new denial narratives that question the science and solutions for climate change constituted 35% of all climate denial on YouTube in 2018, but now represent the large majority (70%). Over the same period, the share of old denial has dropped from 65% to 30% of total claims. The report authors believe that this shift is because the scientific evidence is now more accepted and hard to dispute, so those aiming to win people over to climate denial and delay must discredit the solutions and people pushing for climate action. Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the CCDH, said: \u201cScientists have won the battle to inform the public about climate change and its causes, which is why those opposed to climate action have cynically switched focus to undermining confidence in solutions and in science itself.\u201d This mentality has seeped into UK politics, with rightwing politicians having campaigned for years to persuade the public that net zero is unachievable and too expensive, and that technologies including electric cars and heat pumps do not work. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said recently that climate solutions are too expensive and rowed back on net zero commitments. Young people are particularly heavy users of YouTube \u2013 the Pew Research Center recently found 13- to 17-year-olds use YouTube more than any other social media platform, with 71% using it daily. Examples highlighted by the report of channels which push these new denial messages include the online figure Jordan Peterson (7.64 million subscribers), and channels such as BlazeTV (1.92 million subscribers) and PragerU (3.21 million subscribers). Ahmed added: \u201cYoung people spend a huge amount of time on video-sharing platforms like YouTube. These new forms of climate denial, which have proliferated rapidly over the last six years, are designed to confuse and weaken public support for climate action in the coming decades. \u201cIt is hypocritical for social media companies to claim to be green but then monetise and amplify lies about the climate. \u201cIt is time for digital platforms to put their money where their mouth is. They should refuse to amplify or monetise cynical climate denial content that undermines faith in our collective capacity to solve humanity\u2019s most pressing challenge.\u201d YouTube and Google, which owns the video platform, have been urged to stop promoting climate disinformation on their platforms. The report found that large brands and non-profits had paid-for adverts next to many of the widely viewed videos containing new denial messages. Michael Khoo, a climate disinformation expert at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cBig tech fuels the spread of denial that is stopping climate action. We\u2019ve pressured Google to stop supporting climate denial in the past, but they\u2019ve done little. The New Climate Denial report shows a disturbing shift in the tactics used by bad actors to derail the action needed to avert further disaster. \u201cPlatforms like YouTube have developed technology to monopolise young people\u2019s attention and shouldn\u2019t direct that towards climate denial. All social media companies must stop amplifying and profiting off the climate denial that threatens action on the most pressing crisis of human history.\u201d A YouTube spokesperson said: \u201cOur climate change policy prohibits ads from running on content that contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change. Debate or discussions of climate change topics, including around public policy or research, is allowed. However, when content crosses the line to climate change denial, we stop showing ads on those videos. We also display information panels under relevant videos to provide additional information on climate change and context from third parties.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-14T07:00:22Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak has been accused of trying to avoid scrutiny of his green policies after details surfaced about his government\u2019s failure, over more than 18 months, to appoint a new chair of the independent climate change committee. Senior environmentalists said they believed Sunak may be deliberately trying to avoid appointing a successor to Lord Deben \u2013 who first announced that he was stepping down in July 2022 \u2013 until after a general election, so he does not face criticism for his U-turns on green issues. The Observer can reveal that peer and former Tory minister David Willetts, who had been seen as the clear favourite, was interviewed for the post last summer but has since had no further contact at all from the government about the job and no indication as to whether he is still being considered. It is understood that others who were interviewed for the five-year post last summer \u2013 including former Tory minister Richard Benyon and former head of the environment agency, Emma Howard Boyd \u2013 and the head hunters ministers used to sift applications, have also been left in the dark. A Whitehall source who knows several people who applied for the post said: \u201cNo one seems to know what is going on. There could be a number of reasons. Either Sunak does not want anyone in the job because he wants to avoid being criticised in the run-up to a general election or there is a blockage, a disagreement at high level over who it should be. Whatever it is, it is scandalous that a job like this has not been filled when climate change is supposed to be the most urgent question facing humanity.\u201d In July 2022, it was announced Lord Deben had been asked to continue in the post until the end of June 2023, while a new chair was sought. A year and a half later, the chair is still unfilled, with Prof Piers Forster acting as interim head. The committee suffered another blow last week, when its chief executive, Chris Stark, announced he was standing down after six years. Stark is to join net zero advisory group the Carbon Trust as chief executive. Two weeks ago the Observer reported that the leading UK organisation working on the economic effects of global warming had written to the prime minister condemning the \u201cexcessive delay\u201d in finding a replacement for Lord Deben. Bob Ward, head of policy at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, told Sunak that the holdup was harming efforts to control carbon emissions and damaging the UK\u2019s reputation as a climate change leader. This came amid growing disillusion with Sunak in the green movement. Earlier this year the prime minister astonished environmentalists when he announced an annual system of oil and gas licensing in the North Sea, as well as measures including delaying a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. The Climate Change Committee was set up under the 2008 Climate Change Act to guide national policies on emissions and help the country prepare for the impact of global warming. In the past, it has critcised Britain\u2019s poor performance in areas including flood defences and domestic energy efficiency. One of its key roles is to decide the amounts of greenhouse gas the UK will emit in coming decades. The next carbon budget, the UK\u2019s seventh, will set levels for the period 2038 to 2042. Before the appointment of a new chair can be announced, he or she has to be approved by the devolved administrations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Sources in the Scottish government suggested they had been engaged in discussions over a successor but indicated that no appointment was imminent. A Scottish government spokesperson said: \u201cUnder the terms of the UK Climate Change Act 2008, the appointment of the UK Climate Change Committee (CCC) Chair is made jointly by the UK and devolved governments. \u201cWe would anticipate announcements about the Chair appointment later this year to ensure a smooth transition with the current interim CCC Chair, Piers Forster.\u201d Tessa Khan, co-founder of Uplift, an NGO that supports the transition from fossil fuels, said: \u201cThis delay [in appointing someone to chair the committee] points to a government that is running scared of scrutiny over its climate record. \u201cRather than tracking progress and sticking to the science, the prime minister would rather we just took his word for it, particularly when it comes to new oil and gas production. We know, for example, that developing the Rosebank oil field is incompatible with the UK\u2019s climate targets, yet the government has nodded it through and plans to hand out even more drilling licences. \u201cMeanwhile homes are flooded across the country, energy bills are unaffordable for millions and the UK is losing out on the massive opportunities from the shift to cheaper, clean energy.\u201d Joss Garman, executive director of the European Climate Foundation, said: \u201cSuccessive governments of all persuasion have respected the Committee for its independent, unbiased and expert advice acting on the clear mandate it was given with cross party support by Parliament. It has been so successful and useful that governments around the world have looked to copy the model and build their own versions. \u201cIt is essential it is not now muzzled, or turned into a political football, for cynical, short-term political expediency.\u201d A spokesman for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the government was committed to meeting its net zero targets and would appoint a successor to Lord Deben \u201cin due course.\u201d"

            "content": "Cop29, the next round of UN talks to tackle the climate crisis, will be led by another veteran of the oil and gas industry. Mukhtar Babayev, Azerbaijan\u2019s ecology and natural resources minister, has been appointed the president-in-waiting for the Cop29 climate talks when they take place in the country in November. Before his entry into politics in the autocratic country in western Asia, once a Soviet republic, Babayev spent 26 years working for the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (Socar). Close observers of the Cop process will see parallels with the appointment of Sultan Al Jaber, who moonlighted from his role as the chief executive of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company to preside over the summit when it took place in Dubai last year. Sceptics have already begun to point to Babayev\u2019s appointment as raising questions over the commitment to the global phase-out of fossil fuels in Azerbaijan. The country relied on oil and gas for more than 92.5% of its export revenue last year, according to the US government\u2019s International Trade Administration. But Babayev does have form in environmental protection, having spent three years as Socar\u2019s vice-president for ecology, in which time he oversaw efforts to remediate Azerbaijan\u2019s contaminated soils. The country is wrestling with a number of severe ecological problems, including, after 160 years of oil production, decades-worth of damage from the petrochemical organisations that operate there. Born in Baku while Azerbaijan was still part of the USSR, Babayev served in the Soviet military before studying political science at Moscow State University and then foreign economic relations at the Azerbaijan State University of Economics. He joined Socar in 1994, working in foreign economic relations and marketing until his appointment as the company\u2019s ecology tsar in 2008. According to a US diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks, on his appointment to that role Babayev hosted the first ecology conference in Azerbaijan\u2019s history. In the environment role, he described remediation as the \u201cshared mission and moral imperative\u201d of all Azerbaijanis, but also said that any fall in oil prices could hamper efforts. US diplomats reported him as saying in a subsequent meeting that his mission was to \u201cchange the mentality\u201d of Azerbaijanis about their responsibilities to the environment, and even joking that his new role made him and Socar\u2019s first vice-president \u201cenemies\u201d. But he reportedly emphasised his role was to change Socar\u2019s attitude to the environment while nonetheless continuing to develop Azerbaijan\u2019s oil industry. In 2010, Babayev entered politics, becoming an MP for the ruling New Azerbaijan party, which has won every election in the country since 1993. He was appointed minister for ecology in 2018, in which role he has fulminated against alleged ecological destruction by Armenians living in territories claimed by Azerbaijan. Simon Stiell, the UN climate change executive secretary, welcomed the appointment, exhorting his team to work with Babayev and Yalchin Rafiyev, his lead negotiator, to deliver \u201ca successful Cop29\u201d. The Azerbaijan government has been approached for comment."

            "date": "2024-01-18T11:00:34Z",
            "content": "It hadn\u2019t snowed in New York City for 701 days \u2013 a record \u2013 so when it started to come down on Tuesday, children\u2019s jaws dropped like kids seeing bananas for the first time after the second world war. Older people, if they had lived in New York for more than a few years, promptly ruined the moment by pointing out it wasn\u2019t real snow, there wasn\u2019t enough for school to be cancelled, and it was unlikely to accumulate sufficiently for sledding. Ah, the magic of adulthood. It is alarming to see the environment change in one\u2019s lifetime, and this isn\u2019t anything close to a lifetime. Even a decade ago, New Yorkers were used to the city shutting down for a week at a time when the latest massive snow storm came in. In February 2010, a total of 36in fell in the city, part of a winter of 51in of snow. In 2006, a blizzard dumped 26.9in of snow on the area, a record rivalled 10 years later when so much snow fell across the state that the governor briefly banned travel. The cold front on Tuesday, by contrast, dumped, or rather lightly dusted, Central Park with about an inch of snow, followed almost immediately by rain. By the time schools let out, grumbling parents forced to head to the park watched in amazement as their snow-deprived children screamed with joy at the grey chips of ice. There have, of course, been countless other canary-in-the-coalmine weather moments around the world over the last few years, by which I mean less the dramatic rise in wildfires and flood water than the smaller ambient shifts of, for instance, finding oneself outside in a T-shirt on Christmas Day. These apparently minor fluctuations feel in some ways more sinister, more frogs-in-boiling water (if we want to stick with dead-animal alarm systems), than more seismic, newsworthy shifts. \u201cIt\u2019s not normal,\u201d we say to one another, like bad actors at the start of a disaster movie, and move on, wondering if it\u2019s an anomalous blip. The end of meaningful snow in New York, if that\u2019s what this is, seems of a different magnitude altogether, not least because it interferes with the character of the city at a level that feels vaguely symbolic. From a practical point of view, the absence of large annual snowfall will save the city millions of dollars in snowploughing and general shut-down costs. Lives will probably be saved, although my second biggest New York death anxiety after an air-conditioner falling on my head \u2013 being killed by falling ice \u2013 won\u2019t be affected by the absence of snow. The loss, in the end, is sentimental. Inhabitants of any big city know the wonder of heavy snowfall, the experience of waking up after the blizzard and looking through one\u2019s window at a place transformed. There is almost no quicker route back to the state of being a child, only with the deep added bonus of knowing you can cancel your obligations. Zoom was supposed to nix snow days, but as we all know, snow days are a state of mind; when there\u2019s 6ft of snow outside, no one is doing any work. I miss that feeling of stolen time, and I miss the grandness of a big snow event that always seemed in keeping with New York\u2019s general self-image. When I look at photos from six years ago of pulling my toddlers on a sled up the middle of the street, the cars round-shouldered with snow either side, I miss that particular quality of silence that only comes with heavy snowfall. What thin, miserable winters without it. Maybe it\u2019s a blip. Summers always seem hotter in one\u2019s childhood memories, at least for those who grew up in the UK, when in reality they just got better at irrigating the grass on Centre Court at Wimbledon so it didn\u2019t turn brown. Clearly, I\u2019m romanticising the recent past. The last great snow drought in New York was 400 days long and broke on 21 March 1998, although what followed was proper snow, not this pitiful showing. The sun came out today, and it was one of those beautiful, Arctic days that often follow in the wake of a snow storm. It shone on grey, icy streets and we got on with our day.

She is right: while certainly highlighting the role of Russia, in particular, in stoking nuclear confrontation, the programme closes with the bizarre claim that \u201cafter a long battle [the Greenham women] succeeded\u201d in forcing the government to rescind the decision to station Nato intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) here. This is at least the second time that the BBC has promoted such disinformation. On the 25th anniversary of the initial encampment at Greenham Common, the Guardian invited me to comment on this claim.

            "date": "2024-01-08T18:16:01Z",
            "content": "The top director responsible for safety and security at Sellafield is to leave the vast nuclear waste dump in north-west England, it has emerged. Mark Neate, the Sellafield environment, safety and security director, is to leave the organisation later this year. Neate reports directly to Euan Hutton, the interim chief executive of Sellafield, the nuclear waste and decommissioning site in Cumbria, which is also the world\u2019s largest store of plutonium. Multiple safety and cybersecurity failings, as well as claims of a \u201ctoxic\u201d working culture, were revealed in Nuclear Leaks, a year-long Guardian investigation into Sellafield, last month. The energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, said the reports were \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and wrote to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), the state-owned body which ultimately runs Sellafield, demanding a \u201cfull explanation\u201d. In his response last month, the NDA chief executive, David Peattie, said there had been \u201cnecessary changes to the leadership, governance, and risk management of cyber\u201d and responsibility for its cyber function had been moved. A new head of cybersecurity was due to take up the role this month, which Peattie said would ensure \u201csustained focus and leadership on this matter\u201d. Sellafield said Neate had responsibility for cybersecurity operations until January 2023, when control was shifted to report to its chief information officer. It declined to say whether Neate\u2019s departure was related to cybersecurity and safety failings at the site and said that he made the decision to leave last autumn. Sources claimed the timing of the exit of Sellafield\u2019s longest-serving director was related to the company\u2019s performance in critical areas including safety and security. After the Guardian approached Sellafield for comment on Neate\u2019s departure, the company released a statement saying that Neate would be in post for \u201cseveral more months\u201d and was leaving after a \u201ccareer dedicated to ensuring the safety and security of the Sellafield site and its workforce\u201d. Neate said: \u201cI took stock at the end of the summer break and ultimately decided that 2024 was the right time for me to move on.\u201d Neate joined Sellafield in 2012 and has held a number of roles, including director of security and resilience. He has a military background, including as a strategist during the Iraq war and working with the US army under the then general David Petraeus. Sellafield is yet to confirm an exact leaving date for the executive. In an interview in 2022, Neate said he was proud of Sellafield\u2019s security record, and acknowledged his responsibilities. \u201cIf we sneeze here the whole industry gets a cold,\u201d he said. \u201cI do see it as fun,\u201d he said of his job. Sellafield has \u201cmore work to do\u201d to reduce safety incidents, according to its annual accounts for the year to March 2023 which were published in late December. The accounts showed that annual operating costs at the taxpayer-funded site climbed by \u00a3170m to \u00a32.5bn. Last financial year the company pleaded guilty to a prosecution brought by the Office for Nuclear Regulation under health and safety regulations after an employee was injured falling from a scaffold ladder while carrying out repair work. The company was fined \u00a3400,000 and ordered to pay \u00a329,210 in costs as well as a surcharge of \u00a3190. The GMB trade union last month called on the government and nuclear authorities to take \u201curgent action\u201d to address concerns over safety at Sellafield. Sellafield, which has more than 11,000 staff, was last year placed into a form of \u201cspecial measures\u201d for consistent failings on cybersecurity, according to sources at the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the security services. Sellafield said it did not have evidence of a successful cyber-attack after the Guardian revealed that groups linked to Russia and China had penetrated its networks. A spokesperson for Sellafield said: \u201cMark Neate has made the decision to leave Sellafield following a decade of dedicated service working as environment, safety and security director. \u201cMark has brought significant value to Sellafield over the past decade, including the role that he played in running our response to the Covid crisis, and we are sad to see him go. \u201cHe made the decision in autumn last year to leave the company, and will continue in his role to ensure a smooth transition to his successor.\u201d Sellafield issued a range of responses to the Guardian\u2019s reports into its cybersecurity, safety and cultural issues, which it published online."

            "date": "2024-01-24T06:00:07Z",
            "content": "Nuclear power generation is likely to break records in 2025 as more countries invest in reactors to fuel the shift to a low-carbon global economy, while renewable energy is likely to overtake coal as a power source early next year, data has shown. China, India, Korea and Europe are likely to have new reactors come on stream, while several in Japan are also forecast to return to generation, and French output should increase, according to a report on the state of global electricity markets published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) on Wednesday. Electricity demand is also expected to increase around the world, fuelled largely by the move to a low-carbon economy. Electric vehicles and heat pumps, as well as many low-carbon industrial processes, require electricity rather than oil and gas. Continuing rapid growth in renewable energy supply means these additional demands are likely to be covered in full by generation from wind, solar and other clean energy sources. Renewables will make up roughly a third of total electricity generation globally by early next year. Dave Jones, the insights director at energy thinktank Ember, said the findings marked a potential turning point. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era,\u201d he said. \u201cFinally, the world seems like it is past peak fossil power, a crucial milestone in the energy transition. [This report] shows that 2023 will mark the end of fossil power growth. As of this year we are likely to be in a new era of declining fossil power.\u201d But he added: \u201cPeaking is not enough \u2013 we need deep and rapid CO2 cuts to keep within our vanishingly small carbon budget. We are doing the right things, we just need to do them even faster.\u201d Fatih Birol, the IEA\u2019s executive director, hailed the developments as a positive sign for the fight against climate breakdown, though he said far more effort was needed. \u201cThe power sector produces more carbon dioxide emissions than any other in the world economy, so it\u2019s encouraging to see that the rapid growth of renewables and a steady expansion of nuclear power are on course to match all the increase in global electricity demand over the next three years,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is largely thanks to the huge momentum behind renewables, with ever cheaper solar leading the way, and support from the important comeback of nuclear power. While more progress is needed, and fast, these are very promising trends.\u201d The IEA\u2019s annual analysis of market developments and policies, Electricity 2024, published on Wednesday, showed that global electricity demand increased by 2.2% in 2023, and was likely to reach about 3.4% from 2024 to 2026. Most of the increase was expected to come from rapidly emerging economies:chiefly China, India and south-east Asia. However, the IEA also warned that the growth of power capacity was still uneven around the world. For instance, while electricity supply has increased overall in Africa, on a per capita basis power use across the continent has remained stagnant for more than three decades. This is a brake on economic and social development, as people in poverty turn to polluting sources of energy such as biomass and paraffin. A lack of readily available electricity also holds back children from education and imperils health whenever hospitals experience blackouts. Birol said: \u201cThe international community needs to work with African governments to enable the urgent progress [in electricity access] that is needed.\u201d Africa has some of the world\u2019s greatest potential for solar and wind generation, and many of the vital minerals needed for renewable generation components, but would-be generators face large obstacles in the form of a high cost of capital for renewable energy projects. Many governments are urging institutions such as the World Bank to adjust their practices to make such development easier."

The landslide is slowly moving towards \u00d8lst, a village of 400 inhabitants south of Randers in Jutland, after the soil started moving at a nearby plant, run by Nordic Waste, where it has already demolished buildings. At least 2m tonnes of contaminated soil is believed to be moving at 2 metres a day \u2013 having slowed down from 9 metres a day \u2013 and is predicted by experts to be heading towards the village. It is feared it could pollute the Alling \u00c5 River. A report by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) into the scandal, which has prompted outrage across Denmark, found the landslide was caused by human, not natural, activity. It is understood to include material from Norway. Cleanup costs are expected to reach 205m Danish kroner (\u00a323.5m) over the next six months and could eventually run into the billions. Nordic Waste, whose website tagline is \u201cwe give the earth new life\u201d, last week declared itself bankrupt, saying: \u201cUnfortunately, the landslide has reached such a scale that we as a company are unable to take up the task of combating it.\u201d Rene M\u00f8ller Larsen, whose business is 500 metres up the hill from the landslide and has lived in the area for decades, said the usually peaceful rural community had been left shaken. \u201cThey have been shocked. And then the garbage [contaminated soil] was moving so fast. The worst case was it came to the village,\u201d he said. While the progress of the landslide has slowed significantly, he believes it will take months before the full impact becomes clear. \u201cWhat is the meaning of taking garbage to Denmark? They only see one thing: money.\u201d There had been speculation in Denmark that the landslide may have been caused by recent heavy rain. However Kristian Svennevig, a senior GEUS researcher and one of the authors of the report into the disaster, said it found evidence dating back to 2021 of the movement, which gathered pace last year before becoming public in December. \u201cWhat we concluded is that it is not a natural phenomenon, it is a man-made phenomenon and climate change is not to blame,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is basically the polluted soil itself that is sliding and it started sliding in the relatively dry years of 2021 and 2022, which is something you would not expect from a natural landslide.\u201d While some of the most imminent dangers have been mitigated, millions of tonnes of contaminated soil are still on the move and it is not yet certain how fast it is moving or how far it will reach. The environment minister, Magnus Heunicke, has said the disaster is still in \u201cthe acute phase\u201d. Svennevig said the creation of a computer model of the landslide would help to better constrain its future path and that the disaster was \u201calready the biggest in this century and it is still developing\u201d. Nordic Waste and the Danish government have been contacted for comment."

            "date": "2024-01-09T14:25:01Z",
            "content": "A threat to blackmail the president of the US\u2019s National Association of Realtors has forced her to resign from the organization which bills itself as the largest professional trade group in the country, she announced on Monday. Tracy Kasper\u2019s abrupt resignation from the presidency of a realtors association that counts on 1.5 million members comes during a particularly turbulent time in the organization\u2019s history \u2013 her predecessor stepped down months earlier when confronted with sexual harassment claims. A statement on Monday from the realtors association recounted how Kasper had informed the group\u2019s leadership that she \u201crecently received a threat to disclose a past personal, non-financial matter unless she compromised her position\u201d. \u201cShe refused to do so and instead reported the threat to law enforcement,\u201d the association\u2019s statement said. Nonetheless, Kasper said \u201cit was best for the organization that she step down,\u201d the statement added. \u201cAs president and a long-time member \u2026 I always have put the interests of [the association] first,\u201d read a statement attributed to Kasper. \u201cAs a result of the recent threat and given the significance of this moment for myself, my family and the organization, it is again time for me to put the interests of [the association] first. So, it is with a mix of gratitude and a heavy heart that I submit my resignation as \u2026 president effective immediately.\u201d The association named Kevin Sears, a broker from Springfield, Massachusetts, as Kasper\u2019s successor. The members of the association \u2013 which touts a strict code of ethics \u2013 participate in the residential and commercial real-estate industries. CNN Business has previously reported that the association is powerful, with more than $1bn in assets as well as a political action committee that raised more than $80m during the 2022 midterm election cycle. However, the real-estate industry as a whole has grappled in recent years with high mortgage rates, which in turn caused home sales to plummet to historic lows amid an unaffordable market, as CNN Business reported. Then, in August, the association made unflattering news headlines when Kasper\u2019s predecessor, Kenny Parcell, was the subject of a New York Times article reporting sexual harassment accusations against him. Past and present employees of the association alleged that Parcell engaged in \u201ca pattern of behavior that included improper touching and lewd photos and texts\u201d. Parcell denied the accusations in the article. But two days later the association announced his resignation from the presidency. Kasper assumed the association\u2019s reins at that point, pledging in a statement she would foster \u201ca welcoming, safe and respectful workplace\u201d. In November, Kasper lost her chief executive at the association when he resigned a couple of days after the organization and two brokerages were held liable for $1.8bn in damages. Federal jurors in Missouri hearing the case found the defendants had conspired to maintain artificially high real-estate agent commissions. The association has said it plans to appeal the verdict. The tumult prompted one real-estate agent to launch a group aimed at holding the organization accountable. That agent, Jason Haber, said on Monday on X that he welcomed Kasper\u2019s departure yet was gravely concerned by its alleged circumstances. \u201cNo one should be the victim of threats, intimidation or harassment,\u201d Haber wrote. \u201cIf that happened to Ms Kasper, that person should be prosecuted to the fullest extent under the law.\u201d"

            "title": "Australia sheds 65,000 jobs in December but unemployment rate remains at 3.9%",
            "date": "2024-01-18T01:19:03Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s jobless rate held steady in December but employers shed more than 100,000 full-time jobs as the impact of higher interest rates dragged on the economy. The unemployment rate for the month was a seasonally adjusted 3.9%, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on Thursday. That compared with economists\u2019 forecast of 3.9% and the previously reported 3.9% rate for November. The surprise, though, was the net loss of 65,000 jobs for December, compared with market expectations of an additional 15,000. Full-time jobs dived by 106,600, the most since May 2020 during Covid, according to Bloomberg. Part-time positions only clawed back 41,400 positions. Another surprise was the steep drop in the participation rate, a gauge of the proportion of the population looking for work. That dropped from a revised record 67.3% in November to 66.8%. Hours worked also slid 0.5% for the month. The jobs figures are the first major statistics released for December and offer one indicator of the strength of the economy at the end of last year. The labour market has generally surprised economists for its strength since the Covid disruptions here and in other nations. The Reserve Bank forecast in November that the the jobless rate will drift higher to about 4.25% by the end of 2024. Its board will meet for the first time this year on 5-6 February when it will also release updated economic forecasts. Prior to today\u2019s figures, all of the big four banks were forecasting the RBA wouldn\u2019t need to add to its 13 interest rate rises since May 2022. A first rate cut should arrive by the second half of this year. The ABS said last month\u2019s poor results followed a better performance in the previous two. \u201cThe fall in employment in December followed larger than usual employment growth in October and November, a combined increase of 117,000 people, with the employment-to-population ratio and participation rate both at record highs in November,\u201d said David Taylor, ABS\u2019s head of labour statistics. \u201cWhile the December employment fall was large, the number of employed people was still 52,000 higher than September,\u201d he said. \u201cLooking over the past twelve months, seasonally adjusted employment increased by an average of 32,000 people per month, showing reasonably strong underlying growth during 2023.\u201d Hours worked had been dropping through the second half of last year and were now back to the levels of last February, Taylor said. Ben Udy, lead economist for Oxford Economics Australia, said that \u201c[w]hile we\u2019re always cautious to avoid reading too much into a single monthly data point, the deterioration in the labour market is clearly in full swing\u201d. \u201cWe expect this softening to continue in 2024 and forecast the unemployment rate to approach 4.5% by the end of this year,\u201d Udy said. David Bassanese, chief economist for BetaShares, said the sharp drop in employment last month \u201cshould be taken with a grain of salt given the volatility in the jobs numbers over recent months\u201d. \u201cAny upward drift in the unemployment rate over 2024 will give the RBA more room to move in terms of rate cuts over the year,\u201d Bassanese said. Across the states, NSW continued to have the lowest jobless rate at 3.4%, unchanged from November. Victoria\u2019s rate was also unchanged at 4% while Queensland\u2019s improved to 4.3% from 4.4%. The ACT and WA were two regions to see the rate tick higher, coming in at 3.9% for both. The ABS noted floods and storms in parts of Queensland had made it harder to gather data for that state. Still, it deemed the figures were \u201cfit for publication without any need for imputation\u201d but was open to undertaking \u201cadditional analysis of the collected data to ensure the quality of final estimates\u201d. Market reaction was limited. The Aussie dollar initially dropped about 0.1 US cent but remained at about 65.5 US cents, while the stock market modestly pared its losses for the day."

            "content": "Time for a recap\u2026. Unemployment in the eurozone has fallen back to a record low of 6.4% in November, despite signs that Europe\u2019s economy is struggling. BlackRock has warned there could be a bond market revolt if UK political parties promise much greater spending or unfunded tax cuts in a bid to win this year\u2019s election. Hays, the global recruitment consultants, has reported a slowdown in demand at the end of last year, knocking its fees by 15% in December. The fast fashion company Boohoo is considering closing a factory that it set up in Leicester as a model for its efforts to improve the treatment of workers making its clothing. The struggling online retailer is consulting with up to 100 workers at the site just two years after it was opened to great fanfare with the intention of using it for \u201csupplier learning and development\u201d, creating 170 jobs. At least some of those roles are understood to be linked to manufacturing. Staff working on quality assurance and ethical compliance that are also based there are expected to be moved to another site in Leicester, in the change, which was first reported by Drapers trade journal. A spokesperson for Boohoo Group, which owns the Debenhams, Pretty Little Thing, Oasis and Burton brands as well as its main label, said: \u201cWe opened Thurmaston Lane in January 2022 to support [Boohoo] in several ways, including manufacturing, printing and training.

It is currently developing \u2018AIO-001\u2019, a treatment for asthma which is ready to enter mid-stage clinical trials. Bond trading giant PIMCO has published its latest economic outlook for the next six to 12 months today. PIMCO warns that the economic resilience of 2023 will give way to stagnation in 2024, and that recession risks are elevated \u2013 even though central banks are trying to achieve a soft landing. They warn that central banks could cut rates more aggressively than the markets expect, and point out that the UK and Europe are more interest-rate-sensitive than the US, and are also vulnerable to weak growth in China. Here are the key points: After major economies showed surprising resilience in 2023, we anticipate a downshift toward stagnation or mild contraction in 2024. The standout strength of the U.S. is likely to fade over our six- to 12-month cyclical horizon. After a rally across many financial markets in late 2023, riskier assets appear priced for an economic soft landing and may be underestimating both upside and downside risks. With attractive valuations and yields still near 15-year highs, fixed income markets can offer an array of opportunities with the potential to weather multiple macroeconomic scenarios. In credit markets, we continue to favor U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and other high quality assets backed by collateral, which offer both attractive yields and downside resiliency. We expect to be broadly neutral on duration after the most recent bond-market rally, which has brought global yields back in line with our expected ranges, and amid the shifting balance of inflation and growth risks. Stocks are losing ground on Wall Street in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed 269 points, or 0.7%, down to 37,413 points. Boeing is the top faller, down 1.8%, as the crisis at the aeroplane-maker continues. Overnight, both Alaska Airlines and United reported they had found loose parts on multiple Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft, following the mid-air blowout of a door plug on one flight last Friday. 27 of the 30 stocks on the Dow are in the red, as investors continue to fret that interest rates may not be cut as quickly as hoped. Fiona Cincotta, senior financial market analyst at City Index, explains: Attention remains on inflation data, which is due later this week and will offer further clues about the Federal Reserve\u2019s path for interest rates. Federal Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic, a voting member this year, said he sees the first cut in the third quarter and leans towards keeping rates high while inflation is above 2%. His hawkish comments have weighed on stocks and boosted the US dollar. Newsflash: the World Bank has warned that the global economy is set to slow for a third successive year in 2024 and is now on course for its weakest half-decade of growth since the early 1990s. The Washington-based organisation said poor countries were being especially hard hit by a series of setbacks since the arrival of the Covid pandemic and there was a risk that the 2020s would be a \u201cwasted\u201d decade. The Bank\u2019s half-yearly global economic prospects (GEP) \u2013 which concentrates primarily on the performance of developing and low-income countries \u2013 found an uneven picture in the recovery period since much of the world was shut down in 2020. Indermit Gill, the World Bank\u2019s chief economist, said by the end of 2024 all developed economies would have higher income per head than before the pandemic, as against two-thirds of low income countries and less than half of fragile or conflict countries. \u201cWithout a major course correction, the 2020s will go down as a decade of wasted opportunity,\u201d Gill said, adding: \u201cNear-term growth will remain weak, leaving many developing countries \u2013 especially the poorest \u2013 stuck in a trap: with paralysing levels of debt and tenuous access to food for nearly one out of every three people. That would obstruct progress on many global priorities.\u201d More here. There\u2019s no immediate sign that bond vigilantes are shunning the UK, though. In fact, a British government bond auction today has attracted the strongest demand since April 2020. The sale of \u00a32.25bn of UK 20-year bonds attracted bids for 3.62 times the volume of gilts on offer. Reuters says makes this the most over-subscribed auction since a sale of 20-year gilts early in the pandemic, when investors were very keen to buy safe assets. High demand is good news for the government, as it can choose the most attractive bids on offer. The 2043 gilt sold at an average yield of 4.391%. The list of top global leaders attending Davos next week for the World Economic Forum has just been released. France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar will be rubbing shoulders at the ski resort with China\u2019s premier Li Qiang, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and Argentina\u2019s new leader Javier Milei. However, Rishi Sunak is not on the list, suggesting the UK PM could be planning to swerve Davos again (as he did last year too). The theme of this year\u2019s Davos is \u201cRebuilding Trust\u201d, but the event will be overshadowed by conflict in the Middle East, as well as in Ukraine. Several Middle Eastern leaders will attend, including Israel\u2019s president Isaac Herzog, Qatar\u2019s PM Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Jordan\u2019s PM Bisher Hani Al Khasawneh, Iraq\u2019s Mohammed Shyaa Al Sudani and Lebanon\u2019s Najib Mikati. The US delegation will include Antony Blinken, US Secretary of State; Jake Sullivan, US National Security Adviser, plus representatives from the Senate and House of Representatives. WEF say that more than 60 heads of state and government are expected, including: Li Qiang, Premier of the People\u2019s Republic of China; Emmanuel Macron, President of France; Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission; Javier Milei, President of Argentina; Han Duck-soo, Prime Minister of the Republic of Korea; Pedro S\u00e1nchez, Prime Minister of Spain; Viola Amherd, President of the Swiss Confederation 2024 and Federal Councillor of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports; Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine; Alexander De Croo, Prime Minister of Belgium; Gustavo Francisco Petro Urrego, President of Colombia; Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Prime Minister of Greece; Mohammed Shyaa Al Sudani, Prime Minister of Iraq; Leo Varadkar, Taoiseach of Ireland; Bisher Hani Al Khasawneh, Prime Minister of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan; William Samoei Ruto, President of Kenya; Najib Mikati, President of the Council of Ministers of Lebanon; Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai, Prime Minister of Mongolia; Mark Rutte, Prime Minister of the Netherlands; Bola Ahmed Tinubu, President of Nigeria; Andrzej Duda, President of Poland; Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar; Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, President of Serbia; Tharman Shanmugaratnam, President of Singapore; Ranil Wickremesinghe, President of Sri Lanka; Isaac Herzog, President of the State of Israel; Srettha Thavisin, Prime Minister of Thailand; Pham Minh Chinh, Prime Minister of Vietnam. Jeremy Hunt had reportedly held talks with some of the City\u2019s top business leaders this morning, in a bid to inject fresh momentum into London\u2019s stock market, and encourage more firms to float here. According to Sky News, the chief executives of asset managers Abrdn and Schroders and their counterpart at HSBC Holdings were among those scheduled to attend a breakfast summit with the chancellor. Sky says: City sources said the objective of the meeting was to review existing initiatives aimed at boosting the competitiveness of UK equity capital markets following the Mansion House reforms unveiled last year by Mr Hunt. Among the measures he announced last summer was a move to liberalise the rules governing the spectrum of assets in which pension funds can invest. The London Stock Exchange has been hit by a number of prominent multinationals, including gaming group Flutter Entertainment, building materials company CRH and TUI, the tour operator, either cancelling their UK listings or drawing up plans to. There is a risk of a UK bond selloff this year, if political parties pledge giveaways in the run-up to the next general election, asset management giant BlackRock has warned. Vivek Paul, BlackRock\u2019s UK chief investment strategist, told Bloomberg that UK bonds could come under pressure if voters are promised looser fiscal policy \u2013 such as lower taxes. Paul said: \u201cAs inflation falls in the UK and we get closer to the general election date, major UK political parties may be more tempted to promise looser fiscal policy \u2014 the more this occurs, the greater the likelihood of the return of the bond vigilantes.\u201d \u201cIn the lead-up to this year\u2019s UK election, we\u2019re watching the fiscal policy stance.\u201d The Conservative party appear keen to fight the next election on the issue of tax; last weekend, Rishi Sunak said he wants to cut taxes for working people further this year, possibly cutting welfare payments to fund it. Tax cuts could also be \u2018funded\u2019 by cutting investment, although that would be a short-sighted strategy. Alternatively, lower taxes could lead to higher borrowing to cover the gap between the government\u2019s income and spending. Increased borrowing needs could push down bond prices, increasing the yield (or interest rate) on the debt, as investors demand a higher rate of return for buying UK debt. The UK got a taste of this in September 2022, when the markets balked at the unfunded tax cuts in the mini-budget, sending bond yields soaring. As BlackRock\u2019s Paul points out: \u201cThe shadow of the autumn 2022 UK gilt crisis still hangs over the pre-election debate so far.\u201d BlackRock is currently staying neutral on the UK\u2019s government bonds, Bloomberg adds. More here. Elsewhere in Europe, the European Commission could potentially launch a full-blown investigation into Microsoft\u2019s $13bn investment in artificial intelligence developer OpenAI. The EC says it is looking into some of the agreements that have been concluded between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers, to examine the impact of these partnerships on market dynamics. And Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI is in its sights. The EC says: Finally, the European Commission is checking whether Microsoft\u2019s investment in OpenAI might be reviewable under the EU Merger Regulation. That investment was brought into the spotlight after the turmoil at OpenAI late last year, when founder Sam Altman was dramatically fired, and then reinstated a few days later after staff threatened to revolt. Following the upheaval, Microsoft now has a non-voting observer seat on a newly assembled OpenAI board. UK regulators are also concerned. Last month, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) began reviewing if the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership had resulted in \u201can acquisition of control\u201d. The EU says today it has launched two calls for contributions on competition in virtual worlds and generative artificial intelligence (\u2018AI\u2019) and sent requests for information to several large digital players. The calls for contributions on virtual worlds and generative AI are available here. A significant increase in eurozone unemployment looks very unlikely over the coming quarters, says ING, given that employment expectations are rising again. Peter Vanden Houte, ING\u2019s chief economist for the eurozone, points out that the eurozone\u2019s labour market remains historically tight. Following this morning\u2019s drop in eurozone unemployment to a joint record low, Vanden Houte explains: Although the eurozone has been going through a soft patch with year-on-year GDP growth in the third quarter, and likely also in the fourth quarter, close to zero, this has not had any impact on the unemployment rate, which has fallen over the year. There have been several explanations for this. The economic weakness has been predominantly in the manufacturing sector, while the more labour-intensive services sector has fared better. On top of that, there has been a preference for shorter work hours, negatively affecting productivity growth per employee and exacerbating the demographically-induced tightness in the labour market. Back in the UK, the GMB union has announced that workers at Amazon\u2019s new flagship warehouse in Birmingham have voted to join industrial action, just weeks after opening. Workers at the Birmingham fulfillment centre will strike on Thursday 25 January, which is the anniversary of the first ever official strike action at a UK Amazon warehouse. Amazon\u2019s new \u00a3500m Birmingham fulfilment centre opened its doors at the end of 2023. Amazon faced nearly 30 days of strike action in the last twelve months, the GMB says, with workers at its Coventry warehouse holding several days of industrial action in the last year. However, it\u2019s not clear that the Birmingham strike will involve many staff. A source close to Amazon told Retail Week last month that \u201cof the 2,000-plus employees at Sutton Coldfield, 34 are members and 19 have voted for strike action\u201d. The GMB are urging Amazon to recognise the union and end poverty pay. Rachel Fagan, GMB Organiser, says: \u201cThe industrial chaos Amazon faces isn\u2019t going to disappear; it\u2019s growing every day. \u201cWe\u2019re just weeks into the new year, but are already seeing the strike action spread to new Amazon workplaces. Here\u2019s Kamil Kovar, economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, on today\u2019s eurozone jobless data: Despite the drop in unemployment in November, the eurozone still has a youth unemployment problem. There were 2.321 million young people (under the age of 25) unemployed across the euro area in November. That follows a drop of 54,000 compared with October, which brought the eurozone unemployment rate down to 14.5% in November, from 14.8% a month before. Compared with November 2022, youth unemployment actualy increased by 49,000 in the euro area. Today\u2019s eurozone unemployment data underscore why the European Central Bank has no plans to start cutting interest rates any time soon, says Bloomberg, adding: Even amid the mild downturn, employers are struggling find staff, pushing wages higher and creating upside risks for inflation. Unemployment in the eurozone has fallen unexpectedly to a joint record low, suggesting Europe\u2019s jobs market remains strong despite the weak growth in the region. The jobless rate in the eurozone dipped to 6.4% last November, new data from Eurostat shows, down from 6.5% in October, matching the record low set in June. A year earlier, the unemployment rate was 6.7%. Economists had expected the eurozone unemployment rate to remain unchanged in November, after the economy shrank by 0.1% in the third quarter of last year. During November, eurozone unemployment dropped by around 99,000 in the eurozone, to 10.97m. In the wider European Union, the unemployment rate slipped to 5.9% in November 2023, from 6% in October. Falling unemployment should help workers find jobs and negotiate pay rises, which may deter the European Central Bank from considering cuts to interest rates soon (especially as inflation rose in December, to 2.9%). Germany\u2019s economy has taken another hit, with industrial production unexpectedly falling in November, the sixth monthly decline in a row. German industrial output fell by 0.7% month-on-month in November, the federal statistics office says, extending the ongoing downturn at German factories. The production of capital goods decreased by 0.7%, while the production of intermediate goods fell by 0.5% and consumer goods output fell by 0.1%, statistics body Destatis says. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, fears there is very little reason for near-term optimism. The order book deflation of the last two years leaves clear marks as well as ongoing energy and policy uncertainty. With a soft or hard landing of the US economy and still very little positive growth momentum in China, external demand for German industrial production is likely to remain weak. The only upside could come from a turning of the inventory cycle. However, even though there are some very tentative signs of inventory reduction, it would still take until late spring before we could see a significant impact on actual production. Brzeski also fears that December is likely to bring more negative surprises, with the first signs of economic fallout from the government\u2019s fiscal woes, disruptions in the Suez Canal and reportedly weak Christmas sales. He adds: All of this points to another small contraction in the fourth quarter, pushing the German economy into the first \u2013 admittedly very minor \u2013 technical recession since 2020. Hays has been hit by a recruitment slowdown in both the UK and globally, says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. And that is a concerning economic signal, Mould explains, after this morning\u2019s warning that profits will be below expectations. \u201cRecruitment stocks are often a good harbinger for the wider economy as companies are keen to hire when they\u2019re feeling confident and tend to freeze recruitment when times are more uncertain. \u201cIn this sense a profit warning from Hays has wider significance. The speed of the deterioration in its outlook will be cause for particular concern. \u201cThe company\u2019s problems look particularly acute in the UK \u2013 but with fees as a whole down 10% for the quarter and down an alarming 15% for December, this is a global issue too. \u201cHays is cutting its own cloth accordingly and as a cyclical business it is used to dealing with fluctuating fortunes. \u201cThe company may have to batten down the hatches for some time, but it will hope a pivot in interest rates and a reduction in inflationary pressures will eventually lead to an improvement in business confidence and help drive a recovery in hiring activity. \u201cWhile this is out of the company\u2019s control, levers it can pull include expanding its \u2018enterprise client\u2019 business which sees firms outsource their temporary and permanent white-collar recruitment to Hays. This could help increase the predictability of earnings.\u201d B&amp;M says it doesn\u2019t expect any material impact from disruption to shipments through the Suez Canal, despite attacks by Houthi militants forcing some shipping companies to avoid the Red Sea. Alex Russo, the boss of the discount goods chain, told Reuters: \u201cI don\u2019t expect any material impact for us. The supply chain for us has sufficient in-built flexibilities so I don\u2019t expect any impact coming into our business.\u201d Last week, retail chain Next warned that difficulties in the Red Sea could delay deliveries and hit sales in the year ahead. City AM say it is \u201ca worrying sign of the health of the UK economy\u201d that recruitment giant Hays has been forced to lower its expectations after a difficult December. Discount retailer B&amp;M has reported a rise in UK revenues in the run-up to Christmas period. B&amp;M\u2019s UK like-for-like revenues rose by 3.7% in the 13 weeks from 24 September to 23 December, rather slower than in France where they grew by 11.3%, while its Heron Foods business grew by 11.7%. Alex Russo, chief executive, said, \u201cThe performance across the Golden Quarter has been pleasing, with strong operational execution across the three businesses. Our strategy remains unchanged - we are an everyday low-price discounter with a laser-focus in keeping excellence in retail standards and our costs the lowest. This allows us to provide our products at the best price to all customers \u2013 many of whom continue to face significant cost-of-living pressures. B&amp;M has also announced a special dividend of 20p per share for investors. But despite this sweetener, its shares have dropped 0.6% this morning. Emma Carr, retail partner at law firm Gowling WLG, says: Despite a slowing in midway-year growth for this discount retailer, its last minute rebound in sales can doubtless be attributed to a rush in last-minute festive sales requirements where the retailer was able to step in and rapidly meet these needs. Of course, capitalising on this as we move into the New Year period will be key for the retailer, as it looks to utilise its traditionally well-focused supply chain capabilities to deliver against the fortunes of other more mainstream supermarket competitors. Shares in Hays are down 12% in early trading in London, after it warned that the fall in fees will hits its profits. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says: \u201cHays has issued a profit warning \u2013 it expects first half pre-exceptional operating profit of about \u00a360 million, missing analysts\u2019 expectations, sending shares sharply lower. In its second quarter trading statement it also said quarterly fees fell by 10%, hurt by weakness in December. But the recruiter said it is too early to tell whether this reflects a more sustained market slowdown. Shares in Hays plunged as much as 19% at one stage this morning and are still down by over 12%. Hiring of permanent staff tends to ebb and flow with the economic cycle. The sluggish global growth backdrop combined with tighter monetary policy has dampened business appetite to pile on additional fixed staffing costs. And while temporary workers typically pick up the slack, Hays said it didn\u2019t see the \u2018normal seasonal step-up in worker volumes\u2019 dealing a double blow to the recruitment firm. Today\u2019s slide reverses much of the rebound in the stock seen since the lows in October. Over a 12-month period shares are down by over a fifth.\u201d Here\u2019s a full breakdown of Hays\u2019 trading in the last quarter of 2023, showing the \u201cclear slowdown\u201d in global markets: Germany: flat fees, or up 2% on a WDA basis. Temp &amp; Contracting flat (up 2% WDA), with volumes down 1%, impacted by lower new sales YoY through the quarter. Perm fees flat YoY UK &amp; Ireland: fees down 17%, with Temp down 13% and Perm slowing through the quarter, down 21% Australia &amp; New Zealand: fees down 20%, with Temp down 16% and Perm slowing through the quarter, down 27% Rest of World: fees down 11%. EMEA ex-Germany fees declined by 5%, with Asia down 11%. The Americas continued to be tough, down 25% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. December has been a cruel month for UK recruiters, and retailers. Hays, the global recruitment consultants, has reported that its fees \u2013 earned by placing candidates into roles) \u2013 fell by 15% last month, as demand from companies looking to fill vacancies slowed. This led to a 10% drop in earnings across the last quarter, and the slowdown means Hays expects to miss market expectations for profits in the first half of its financial year. The company is now accelerating its cost reduction and efficiency programmes, and cut its consultant headcount by 5% in the October-December quarter. In the UK &amp; Ireland, Hays reports that fees fell 17% in the last quarter, including a 13% drop in income from temporary positions and a 21% drop in permanent fees. The slowdown went further too, with Australia &amp; New Zealand fees down 20%, Asia down 11%, and the Americas down 25%. Dirk Hahn, Hays chief executive, says it is \u201ctoo early to say\u201d if December\u2019s weakness shows a sustained market slowdown, or rather that some placements are simply being deferred. But, Hahn warns, near-term market conditions are expected to remain challenging, citing increased uncertainties and reduced client and candidate confidence. He told shareholders: \u201cOverall market conditions became increasingly challenging through the quarter, including a clear slowdown in most markets in December, notably in our Perm businesses as client and candidate decision-making slowed. Temp volumes remained broadly stable sequentially through the quarter, but declined YoY as we did not see our normal seasonal step-up in worker volumes. As a result, we expect operating profit in our first half to be c.\u00a360 million, despite our ongoing actions to reduce costs. UK shoppers also cut back last month, leaving retailers suffering a disappointing festive period, new data this morning shows. Total sales grew 1.7% in December, down from almost 7% growth a year earlier, the British Retail Consortium and consultancy KPMG have reported. Their report shows there was a slight increase spending in the week leading up to Christmas as consumers scrambled to purchase last-minute gifts. But shoppers shunned clothing, jewellery and technology gifts, opting instead for beauty, health and personal care products, while toys and gaming also sold well. And households remained cautious about making larger purchases in the post-Christmas sales. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, says: \u201cThe festive period failed to make amends for a challenging year of sluggish retail sales growth. \u201cWeak consumer confidence continued to hold back spending.\u201d Also coming up today Boeing is facing an escalating crisis after loose parts were discovered on some grounded 737 Max jets, days after an Alaska Airlines plane suffered a mid-air blowout on Friday. Alaska Airlines indicated that its maintenance technicians had found issues when inspecting their 737 Max 9 fleet, saying: \u201cInitial reports from our technicians indicate some loose hardware was visible on some aircraft\u201d. The problems don\u2019t end there either; United Airlines said yesterday it had found loose bolts and other \u201cinstallation issues\u201d on multiple 737 Max 9 aircraft. Boeing\u2019s shares fell 8% yesterday, as investors pondered the possible fallout from the accident.

            "content": "The Republican primaries are under way and \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 the candidates have been ganging up on Bidenomics. Spoiler alert: they don\u2019t like it. Fact check: they are wrong. To a man \u2013 and one woman \u2013 the Republican candidates all say that the US economy is bad and that Americans are struggling financially. They\u2019re warning about sky-high deficits, over-the-top government spending and a potentially catastrophic level of national debt. They point out that interest rates are at a 20-year high and the costs of core things like food, gas and housing are significantly more than they were just a few years ago. They point to a downturn in manufacturing and falling small business confidence. \u201cBidenomics is crushing American families,\u201d said the Republican candidate Nikki Haley. \u201cWe\u2019re paying more for gas, groceries and other basic necessities.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll rip up Bidenomics on day one of my presidency,\u201d the Florida governor and presidential challenger Ron DeSantis warned. Yes, prices and rates are up. But really? Is the economy so bad? I\u2019m a Republican and a small business owner with hundreds of clients in many industries and honestly the economy isn\u2019t that bad. In fact, it\u2019s been really, really good. Just ask Donald Trump, who implicitly admitted this when he recently said he hoped for a \u201ccrash\u201d and that it would \u201cbe in the next 12 months because I don\u2019t want to be Herbert Hoover\u201d. If you don\u2019t believe me, just look at the numbers. Last quarter\u2019s gross domestic product showed growth of 5.2%. That\u2019s a number that dwarfs all other pre-Covid recovery numbers in recent memory. Unemployment is at a record low. Each month the economy is adding hundreds of thousands of new jobs. There are millions of more open jobs available today compared with 2019. Yes, prices are higher, but inflation is down from a 9% annual rate to about 3%, so whatever the Federal Reserve did to offset the treasury\u2019s spending on fiscal programs seems to be working. The stock market is near all-time highs, as is household wealth. Credit card delinquency rates are lower than they\u2019ve been for the past 30 years as are delinquencies on all loans across the banking system. Holiday retail sales were strong and online sales boomed. Plenty of capital is available for businesses that need it and corporations have more cash on hand than in any year before the pandemic. I speak to dozens of industry associations each year and here\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing: just about everyone had a good 2023. The CEOs of our major banks reported strong earnings, after taking into consideration special assessments and one-time charges. Retailers and restaurants have recovered from the pandemic. Convention traffic in Vegas is back to normal. There are almost as many travelers through the airports as there were before Covid. Businesses in the service industries recorded their 12th consecutive month of growth. Sure, there are struggles. Businesses in the real estate industry are challenged by high housing prices and a 13-year low in home sales. Manufacturing has been in contraction for the past 14 months. Media companies are flailing. Technology firms are struggling to find financing. The cost of capital is slowing down financing for small businesses. However, we live in a giant country. California\u2019s economy is as large as that of the entire United Kingdom. North Carolina\u2019s economy is bigger than Sweden\u2019s. Texas\u2019s is bigger than Canada\u2019s. Not every business is going to be doing well in an economy this size. There will always be those that are struggling, be it because of their location, their industry, or the makeup of their customer and supplier base. There are plenty of things that could knock things off course in 2024. Wars. Oil prices. A terrorist attack. Another pandemic. If you want to find the bad in the economy you can do it. And that\u2019s what all the Republican candidates are doing and fair enough, it\u2019s an election year. It\u2019s also true that Bidenomics may not be the reason behind our strong economy. But saying the US economy is bad just isn\u2019t true no matter who you vote for."

            "title": "Labor could raise welfare payments for cost-of-living relief without stoking inflation, economists say",
            "date": "2024-01-03T14:00:05Z",
            "content": "Addressing competition issues and increasing unemployment benefits and pensions are ways the Albanese government could tackle cost-of-living pressures but they would have to be coupled with savings to avoid reigniting inflation, economists say. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, on Wednesday said he had asked Treasury and the finance department to develop \u201cfurther propositions\u201d for providing cost-of-living relief by the May budget. \u201c[What] are the measures that can take pressure off families on cost-of-living without putting pressure on inflation. That\u2019s the key issue here,\u201d Albanese said in Sydney at his first press conference for 2024. \u201cIf you were just to distribute additional cash to people, you potentially make inflation worse and therefore don\u2019t help to solve the problem.\u201d Australia\u2019s consumer price inflation rate peaked in December 2022 at 8.4% and has generally trended down ever since, reaching 4.9% last October. Households and businesses have been squeezed by 13 interest rate rises by the Reserve Bank during the current tightening cycle that began in May 2022. Pressure for more relief is likely to mount as the government\u2019s own finances remain robust in the short term at least, with the strong chance of a second consecutive budget surplus this fiscal year. Cost-of-living support is already about $23bn. The challenge for the government, though, is there are few measures it can take that will have immediate effect and the ones it implemented in 2023 may have diminished effects if extended this year, the analysts said. \u201cThe first thing for people to remember is it\u2019s hard,\u201d Chris Richardson, an independent economist, said. If governments in Australia or elsewhere \u201ccould take care of the cost-of-living crisis, then everybody would be using that magic wand\u201d. The approach taken last year often involved \u201crejigging money\u201d, so households ended up better off at the expense of companies, Richardson said. Examples included setting a price cap on gas that trimmed some of the windfall profits of energy companies after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, rather than any actions drillers themselves took. Doubling typical pharmacy prescriptions to 60 days was another. \u201cThe money comes out of profits and goes into punters\u2019 pockets,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a case for that where profits aren\u2019t reasonable, where something has stopped competition working.\u201d Cassandra Goldie, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service, called on the government to develop a \u201cserious cost-of-living package\u201d that was \u201csquarely targeted to give help to people who need it the most\u201d. Goldie noted the near doubling of support during the Covid pandemic lifted 646,000 people, including 245,000 children, out of poverty. The government\u2019s own Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee found lifting daily jobseeker and related payments to 90% of the age pension from the current $54 to $70 would merely return them to 1999 levels. \u201cThe government must also target energy relief to people who are the most disadvantaged, including by investing in energy efficiency upgrades and solar installations in social housing and low-income rental housing and mandating energy efficiency standards in private rentals,\u201d Goldie said. Independent economist Saul Eslake said the government deserved \u201ca great deal of credit\u201d for not spending additional revenues that had landed via higher commodity prices, inflation or other sources, unlike some previous Coalition governments. \u201cThat ought to be the template,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should avoid the temptation to just throw cash at households.\u201d Richardson said any increase in benefits, such as rental assistance, could be offset by further cuts or delays in \u201cbad infrastructure projects\u201d. In November, the government said it was cutting 50 such projects. According to the RBA, government electricity rebates, increased childcare subsidies and other changes in government policies \u201csubtracted around half a percentage point from headline inflation [of 5.4%] in the September quarter\u201d. One challenge is that policies that helped households last year may not have the same effect as last year, Eslake said. Childcare support, for instance, was already covering much of the cost of that service. Other possible actions could include tweaking or delaying the controversial stage-three tax cuts that will pump about $21bn into the economy next fiscal year. Reducing the GST temporarily from 10% to 9% would help reduce prices immediately but would require compensating the states to the tune of $8.8bn a year, Richardson said. Some price pressure relief, though, may already be on the way, easing the need for government action that anyway wouldn\u2019t take effect until after the May budget. Wholesale power prices, for instance, were down 70% in the September quarter from a year earlier and should at least result in smaller increases in 2024. Global oil prices have also dropped in recent months, bringing the prospect of cheaper motor fuel. \u201cWe do see inflation continuing to moderate \u2013 it\u2019s just a question of how quickly,\u201d said Taylor Nugent, a senior Nab economist. Nab is among the minority of banks to predict the RBA has one more rate rise to come, most likely in February. Nugent said while government subsidies might reduce \u201cmeasured inflation\u201d by lowering the cost of item picked up by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the actions only mask the \u201caggregate\u201d inflation in the economy. The support \u201cmeans that people have more money to spend on other things, and so, on a forward-looking basis, it puts upward pressure on inflation, more generally\u201d, he said. \u201cThat slows that rebalancing of supply and demand that the RBA is looking for in order to get inflation back on a more stable basis.\u201d"

            "content": "Wall Street has opened flat to slightly higher after stronger-than-expected US jobs data. The Dow Jones was little changed while the Nasdaq edged 0.2% higher and the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.3%. Over here, the FTSE 100 index is 0.4% lower while the German and French markets are down 0.3% and 0.6% respectively. The US workforce added 216,000 jobs last month, more than expected by economists, capping another robust year of growth in the face of higher interest rates. Policymakers, weighing when to start cutting borrowing costs, are closely monitoring the strength of the labor market as they try to guide the world\u2019s largest economy to a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d, where price growth normalizes and recession is avoided. American employers had been expected by economists to add about 164,000 jobs in December. Recruitment across the public, healthcare, social assistance and construction sectors helped drive growth as 2023 drew to a close. However, the increases in US jobs in October and November were revised lower by a combined 71,000. Inflation across the eurozone rose in December after an increase in energy costs, reversing six months of consecutive falls and easing the pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut interest rates. Figures from the EU statistical agency Eurostat showed consumer prices across the 20-country bloc rose at an annual rate of 2.9% last month, up from 2.4% in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a slightly higher reading of 3% for December. The increase in the headline rate comes after the end of government support for utility costs, alongside a smaller annual decline in energy prices in December than in November connected to last year\u2019s one-off subsidy in Germany. Thank you for reading the blog. Have a great weekend! We\u2019ll be back next week. \u2013 JK NatWest Group chairman Sir Howard Davies has released a sort of mea culpa, a statement to clarify his earlier remarks that it\u2019s not \u201cthat difficult\u201d to buy a home and people just have to save for it. He said he \u201cdid not intend to underplay the serious challenges\u201d people face buying homes. The interview on radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning provoked outrage, including from campaign group Generation Rent. Critics said his claims showed he was out of touch with the reality faced by many people trying to buy a home. Clarifying his remarks, Davies said: Given recent rate movements by lenders there are some early green shoots in mortgage pricing and while funding remains strong, my comment was meant to reflect that in this context access to mortgages is less difficult than it has been. I fully realise it did not come across in that way for listeners and as I said on the programme, I do recognise how difficult it is for people buying a home and I did not intend to underplay the serious challenges they face. People have to save much more than they did in the past and that is tough for first-time buyers. The role for banks in today\u2019s environment is to lend responsibly and support customers to build a savings habit and move towards home ownership. Torsten Bell, who runs the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the time required to save for a typical first-time buyer deposit has spiralled in recent years. The dollar has given up the gains made since the US jobs numbers were released, as people realised they are not as strong as it first seemed. The greenback is now flat against the pound and the euro, after jumping 0.5% and 0.6% respectively when the data came out just under an hour ago. While employers hired 216,000 people in December, more than the 170,000 expected by Wall Street, the November and October increases in jobs were revised down by a total 71,000. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7%. Axel Merk, founder of Merk Investments, said: Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: There are a few vital signs officials can monitor when trying to diagnose the health of the economy, and the labour market is a crucial one. Developments show that the US labour market isn\u2019t losing steam, ultimately suggesting that economic activity will need a heavier hand to slow it down. That could see interest rate cuts across the pond pushed further out than hoped \u2013 bad news for the market, which until recently was pricing in heavy cuts this year. The data has short-term implications, but the bigger question looks to the future. The resilience shown by the US labour market has been markedly stronger than predicted, which makes bringing things in line without triggering a rock-hard landing becomes a much more delicate task. 2023 overall was a bumper year for the labour market, and the overall temperature is still too hot to be fully comfortable. There\u2019s every chance the Federal Reserve will demand a run of softer macro readings before hitting the rewind button on rates. It shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that the rate of labour growth is slowing, which is a step in the right direction, but there\u2019s work to be done. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said: The slightly bigger-than-expected 216,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in December coupled with a second consecutive 0.4% m/m gain in average hourly earnings means that this labour market report will trigger a further paring back of expectations for a March rate cut. At this stage, however, all that really matters for the Fed is the CPI and PPI data, due next week, which we expect to be more supportive of early action from the Fed. The 216,000 gain last month, was not quite as good as it looks at first glance. Gains in the preceding two months were revised down by a cumulative 71,000. The increase in December was once again concentrated in only a few non-cyclical sectors, with government employment rising by 52,000 and health &amp; social assistance employment up by 59,000. To the extent that it is still a leading indicator of broader employment trends, the 33,000 decline in temporary jobs is also a concern. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.7%, but only because a 676,000 drop back in the size of the labour force almost kept pace with a 683,000 decline in the household survey measure of employment. Those declines more than offset the big gains in November, meaning that both are now below the October levels. With the unemployment rate still muted, December brought a second consecutive 0.4% m/m gain in average hourly earnings, which was enough to push the annual rate back up to 4.1%, from 4.0%. The dollar jumped after the stronger-than-expected increase in US jobs in December, as this suggests the Federal Reserve won\u2019t be in a rush to interest rates. The dollar index hit 103.10, a fresh two-week high, and is now at 102.75, up 0.3%. The greenback strengthened as much as 0.5% against sterling and 0.6% against the euro. It is now trading 0.2% higher against the pound at $1.2650 and against the euro at $1.0917. Some 52,000 new jobs were in government while 164,000 came from the private sector. Here is our full story on the figures: However, Peter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, tweeted: NEWSFLASH: The US economy added 216,000 jobs last month, more than expected, although the November and October increases were revised lower. Economists had expected an increase between 150,000 and 170,000. November\u2019s rise was revised to 173,000 from 199,000 while the October figure was also revised lower, to 105,000 from 150,000, according to the US Labor Department. The unemployment rate stayed at 3.7%, while analysts had expected an uptick to 3.8%. In the meantime, shares in London-listed Revolution Bars have plunged nearly 20% after the company said it would shut eight of its worst-performing bars to reduce future site losses. The company\u2019s bars and pubs trade under the Revolution, Revoluci\u00f3n de Cuba and Peach Pubs brands. The closed bars are: Revolution Bars in Beaconsfield, Derby, Reading, St Peters Liverpool and Wilmslow, Revoluci\u00f3n de Cubas in Sheffield and Southampton and the Playhouse in Newcastle-Under-Lyme. Negotiations for five of the eight bars have already begun for them to be transferred to other operators or their leases rescinded. The closures come despite a 9% rise in like-for-like sales in the four weeks from 4 to 31 December, the group\u2019s best festive period since 2019. But it is worried about the current macro-economic conditions. Like-for-like sales for the first half, including New Year\u2019s Eve, were on an improving trend but remained negative, with a decline of 2.8%. Rob Pitcher, chief executive of Revolution Bars Group, said: We have had the best festive trading period for four years with all of our brands recording positive like for like sales and Revoluci\u00f3n de Cuba being the standout performer. However, our younger customers are still feeling the disproportionate effect of the cost-of-living crisis and the national living wage will increase materially in April 2024. Therefore, we have taken the difficult yet ultimately beneficial step for the Group to close several bars which are unprofitable. Less than 10 minutes to go until non-farm payrolls, a key US jobs report, for December. We are expecting an 150,000 increase in jobs after November\u2019s 199,000. The dollar is rising ahead of the data, heading for its steepest weekly rise since May, as traders are scaling back expectations of early US interest rate cuts this year. The dollar is up 0.2% against a basket of currencies, after touching a fresh three-week high. The index is up 1.3% this week so far, its strongest performance since the week to 15 May. The chair of NatWest Group, Sir Howard Davies, has been criticised as being out of touch, after he said it was not \u201cthat difficult\u201d buy a house at the moment. The campaign group Generation Rent said Davies\u2019s comments were \u201castounding to hear from a senior banker\u201d. Here is our full story: Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank, tweeted: If your home has been flooded, here\u2019s the ABI\u2019s six flood recovery steps: Step 1 - Contact your insurer as soon as possible. They will advise you on arranging emergency accommodation if necessary (or any temporary alternative trading premises if you are a business with business interruption cover), the information they will need from you to support your claim, and how to go ahead with the immediate clean-up and repair process. Step 2 - Assessing the damage and finding temporary accommodation. A loss adjuster will be appointed to assess the claim. An initial assessment of the damage will be done, the repair process explained and the options for alternative accommodation outlined. You should expect to hear from your loss adjuster after contacting your insurer and they will get in touch if they need to arrange a visit to your home. Step 3 - Cleaning and stripping out. Your loss adjuster will organise the cleaning and stripping out of your home. This work should start within four weeks of discussing it with your loss adjuster. Step 4 - Disinfecting and drying your home. Your insurer or loss adjuster will appoint a drying company to disinfect and dry out your home. This can take from a few weeks to several months. Your loss adjuster will give you a timetable and keep you informed. Step 5 - Repair and reconstruction. Repair work should begin shortly after you get your drying certificate from the drying company. Your loss adjuster will appoint a builder to do the repair and reconstruction work and will keep you updated on expected timeframes. Step 6 - Moving back into your home. Your insurer or loss adjuster will discuss with you when you can return home. Depending on how badly damaged your home is, this can be between a few weeks and a year or more after the flood. Some insurers will provide \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d which offers homeowners the chance to install Property Flood Resilience measures up to the value of \u00a310,000 when repairing their properties after a flood. Speak to your insurer about whether you are eligible. The ABI\u2019s guide is here. Here is some insurance advice for homeowners and businesses who have been affected by flooding and storm Henk, from the Association of British Insurers. Damage caused by floods and storm is covered by most standard home insurance and commercial business policies, and comprehensive motor insurance. Louise Clark, general insurance policy adviser at the industry body, said: Insurers expect bad weather to strike at any time and events such as this are exactly what your insurance is for. Their priority right now is to help any affected customers recover as quickly as possible. If you have been affected by flooding, contact your insurer as soon as you can and they will be able to offer help and advice. If you have suffered storm damage: \u00b7 Contact your insurer as soon as possible. Most will have 24-hour emergency helplines to ensure you get advice on what to do and arrange repairs as quickly as is possible. \u00b7 If necessary, arrange temporary emergency repairs to stop any damage getting worse, but speak to your insurer first. If you have to arrange emergency repairs yourself, tell your insurer and keep any receipts, as this will form part of your claim. \u00b7 Do not be in a rush to throw away damaged items, unless they are a danger to health, as these may be able to be repaired or restored. Your insurer will advise. If your home is uninhabitable while repairs are being carried out your insurer will arrange for, and pay the cost of, any alternative temporary accommodation you may need in line with your policy. Commercial polices will cover damage to premises and stock. Business interruption cover (which may be included or purchased separately) will cover additional trading costs, such as hiring temporary alternative trading premises if necessary. Here is the guidance in full. The downturn in the UK\u2019s construction sector eased last month to the slowest rate of decline since September, according to a survey. A sustained slump in house building was the main factor holding back construction output, which firms linked to elevated interest rates and subdued confidence among clients. The headline purchasing managers\u2019 index, which tracks changes in industry activity, rose to 46.8 in December from 45.5 in November. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction. Improving supply conditions meant delivery times for construction items shortened for the tenth month in a row. Price discounting among suppliers contributed to a moderate fall in average cost burdens across the construction sector at the end of 2023. Tim Moore, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, which compiles the survey said: Construction companies experienced another fall in business activity at the end of 2023 as weak order books meant a lack of new work to replace completed projects. House building was the worst-performing area of construction activity, but even in this segment there were signs that the downturn has started to ease. \u201c Elevated borrowing costs and a subsequent slump in market confidence were the main factors leading to falling sales volumes across the construction sector in the second half of 2023. Survey respondents also continued to cite worries about the broader UK economic outlook, especially in relation to prospects for commercial construction. However, expectations of falling interest rates during the months ahead appear to have supported confidence levels among construction companies. December data indicated that 41% of construction firms predict a rise in business activity over the course of 2024, while only 17% forecast a decline. This contrasted with negative sentiment overall at the same time a year earlier. Industry expert Noble Francis tweeted: The December uptick in eurozone inflation will prove temporary, says Nicola Nobile, chief Italy economist at Oxford Economics. As anticipated by yesterday\u2019s national numbers, eurozone inflation rate increased in December. But this was mainly driven by the energy component. German energy inflation, up to 4% was the main culprit as energy inflation was impacted by a strong base effect from the one-off gas price break in December 2022. Apart from energy, all the other components continued their disinflationary trend. Although some of the components, such as food remain elevated and subject to some volatility, the disinflation dynamic is still quite clear. Food inflation (which also includes alcohol and tobacco) was at 6.1% in December, down from around 10% in the summer. Moreover, the second monthly increase in unprocessed foods inflation was very likely driven by unfavourable weather conditions and hence should soon readjust downwards. Core inflation dropped to 3.4%, from 3.6% in November, driven by a decrease in non-energy industrial goods inflation. Services inflation remained at 4% over the year, but also in this area the monthly dynamic offers some optimism. The 0.7% m/m increase in services inflation is a touch lower than the 2010-2019 average December monthly increase\u2026 Overall, apart from the monthly volatility, this was another encouraging inflation report and further confirms that a quick disinflationary process is underway. But today\u2019s print will not offer any major insights on the ECB easing cycle. We expect that the January inflation print will be much more informative, as large price adjustments typically happen at the start of the year, with this year\u2019s January print also impacted by the end of the energy-related fiscal measures in some countries. We will follow up on this specifically in forthcoming research. Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at ING, said: The increase in headline inflation was mainly driven by energy base effects in Germany. The core inflation rate dropped from 3.6 to 3.4%, indicating that the underlying trend in inflation remains relatively benign for the moment. Food inflation also continued to trend down rapidly. Inflationary pressures made way for disinflation over the course of 2023 as demand weakened and supply shocks faded. This has brought inflation down more than expected at the start of last year. Currently though, base effects from easing supply shocks are moderating and some new inflationary concerns are surfacing. Think of the increased supply chain concerns related to the Red Sea. Besides that, German government measures are also adding to inflation for 2024. The European Central Bank\u2019s mantra has always been that the last leg is the hardest. Is this what we are currently witnessing? Don\u2019t overestimate the inflationary pressures for now though. Demand remains weak, which is a very important disinflationary driver right now. Also, inventories are high, making current supply chain concerns much less inflationary than the ones from 2021. And even though energy price shocks related to the Middle East are a clear risk to the outlook, oil prices are currently still below US$80 per barrel. So overall, the outlook for inflation continues to be quite benign and we expect eurozone inflation to be around 2% again by the end of the year. And what does this mean for interest rates? Current inflationary developments therefore seem to support our view that recent market expectations of a first-quarter hike are premature, but don\u2019t think that we\u2019re back to \u2018higher for longer\u2019 either. We expect the ECB to start cautiously cutting rates from June onwards, with 75bp in total for 2024. Sir Howard Davies, chair of NatWest Group, has caused a bit of a stir with his comments this morning that it\u2019s not \u201cthat difficult\u201d for people to get on the housing ladder. He said on BBC radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that difficult at the moment [to buy a house]. You have to save, and that\u2019s the way it always used to be\u2026 But what we saw in the financial crisis was the risk of having people being able to borrow 100% In order to get onto the property ladder and then suffering severe falls in the equity value of their houses and having to leave and having a bad credit record etc. So there were dangers in very, very easy access to mortgage credit. So I totally recognise that there are people who find it very difficult to start the process. They will have to save more. But that is, I think, inherent in the change in the financial system, as a result of the mistakes that were made in the last global financial crisis and we have to accept we\u2019re still living with that. The number of new cars registered in the UK has jumped by nearly 18% but electric vehicle demand is flatlining, prompting the industry to call for a VAT cut to stimulate sales. Annual figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) on Friday show 1.9m new cars were registered last year, well up on the previous year\u2019s figure of 1.6m and the highest level since the 2.3m registrations of 2019. The increase is a boost for the automotive industry after the pandemic led to supply chain problems and a shortage of vital computer chips that slowed production. Across the year, 315,000 new battery electric vehicles were sold. That was 50,000 more than 2022, but the number being bought as a share of total registrations failed to grow as expected. They represented just 16.5% of the total, slightly down on last year\u2019s 16.6%. Inflation in the eurozone has risen again and could go higher in the coming months, which makes early interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank less likely. Inflation across the 20-nation bloc rose to 2.9% in December from November\u2019s two-year low of 2.4% because of a reduction of government subsidies on gas, electricity and food. The data are in line with the ECB\u2019s expectation that inflation bottomed out in November. The central bank is projecting that price growth will range between 2.5% and 3% through 2024, well above its 2% target, before slowing again next year. However, underlying inflation \u2013 price growth excluding food and energy which tend to be volatile \u2013 eased to 3.4% from 3.6%. The ECB, which next meets on 25 January to discuss monetary policy, pushed back against investor expectations of imminent rate cuts last month. It wants to see wage pressures cool first to ensure infation is on track to fall back to its target. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Finalto Financial Services, said: European stock markets slipped in early trading, pushing the main indices firmly into the red in the first week of trading in 2024 as the data paints a picture of weakening economic activity and higher inflation. Weak PMI data for the euro area was confirmed, whilst German consumer inflation surged higher as energy subsidies faded. German\u2019s inflation hit 3.8% in December, up from 2.3% in Nov. Final inflation data for the Eurozone as a whole is due at 10am, expected up to 3.0% from 2.4%. Meanwhile FOMC minutes earlier this week suggested the Fed is not quite so close to cutting rates; the US 10-year Treasury yield broke above 4%, helping the dollar hit its highest since the middle of December and keeping the pressure on risk assets. Shares in London, Frankfurt and Paris all retreated on Friday morning, with the US jobs report in focus. The Nasdaq notched its fifth straight daily decline on Thursday, whilst the S&amp;P 500 dropped for a fourth session in a row with Apple suffering again on another downgrade. For the week, the FTSE 100 is off about three-quarters of a percent, held up relative to peers with oil firmer, whilst the Dax is down 1.4% and CAC is 2% lower with luxury taking a bit of a bashing on China fears. On the financial markets, stocks are falling while crude oil prices have risen more than 1% amid tensions in the Middle East. Brent crude futures are up 87 cents at $78.46 a barrel while US light crude is 97 cents ahead at $73.16 a barrel. US secretary of state Antony Blinken is heading to the Middle East for a week of diplomacy to try and prevent the Israel-Gaza conflict from widening. You can read more here: Attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen on commercial ships in the Red Sea have also triggered supply concerns. On the stock markets , the FTSE 100 index has fallen nearly 67 points, or 0.9%, to 7,656, as optimism about interest rate cuts fades. Germany\u2019s Dax is down 105 points, or 0.6%, at 16,513 while France\u2019s CAC has lost 66 points, a 0.9% drop to 7,384. Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has shed 184 points, or 0.6%, to 30,221. Sir Howard Davies, who chairs NatWest, has warned that we we could see a \u201crather slow reduction in interest rates\u201d this year because \u201cwage expectations are quite high\u201d. Speaking on radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he explained why lenders have already started to cut mortgage rates in a fierce price war. As financial markets are now expecting a series of rate cuts from the Bank of England this year, therefore you can, as a bank, fix your interest rate at a slightly lower level than you could even a couple of months ago. And it\u2019s that fixing of the rates in the market that determines what we can offer to customers. So the market expectations of rates are falling, therefore, we can pass that on to people who want a new mortgage. He said because the Bank of England was criticised for being slow to raise interest rates when inflation shot up mainly due to higher energy and food prices, policymakers will be careful when they reduce borrowing costs. Even at the last meeting in December, three of the nine members of the [rate-setting] committee still voted for a further increase in rates. So they\u2019re quite a long way away at the moment from a majority in favour of a reduction in rates. And there is a risk of that, having been burned once by reacting too slowly. They are now going to be rather cautious in coming down. It\u2019s likely that we will see a rather slow reduction in rates during the year. They will of course be influenced by what is going on in retail prices, not rising anything like as rapidly as they were, but still wage expectations are quite high and that if you read the recent speeches from the Bank of England, thats what\u2019s worrying them the most. Here\u2019s a lookahead to what 2024 might bring in the housing market: The EY Item Club forecasting group said the 1.1% month-on-month rise in the Halifax measure of house prices in December capped off a year when values proved much more resilient than forecasters had expected. An average of the Halifax and Nationwide measures was down 1.5% in the fourth quarter on a year earlier, in contrast to consensus predictions last January of a fall of 6.5%. Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the group, said: Two factors have led to a modest correction. Firstly, unemployment has remained low. Secondly, the rise in mortgage interest rates has been much more protracted than in the past, reflecting a shift in the mortgage stock from variable to fixed rate. Both factors have kept forced sales down and limited supply. The closing months of 2023 saw a recovery in demand for properties, albeit from a low level. Mortgage approvals in December rose to a six-month high. This was probably aided by falling mortgage rates, as investors have priced in a substantial series of rate cuts by the Bank of England this year. The EY Item Club thinks this recovery should continue as mortgage rates continue to drift down and lower inflation makes for a likely more predictable macroeconomic outlook. The fact that the ratio of house prices to average earnings is down by over a tenth since the 2022 peak, reflecting a fall in prices alongside strong growth in wages, should also support demand. This can cause a lot of stress and sleepless nights. My colleague Jedidajah Otte has talked to homeowners who fear a sharp rise in mortgage payments as they come off fixed-rate deals this year. However, mortgage costs are still much higher than they have been in recent years after the Bank of England raised interest rates to 5.25% to fight stubbornly high inflation. (Financial markets expect it to cut rates to below 4% by the end of the year.) As a result, homeowners are facing a \u00a319bn increase in mortgage costs as millions more fixed-rate deals expire and borrowers are forced to renegotiate their home loans after the toughest round of interest rate increases in decades, writes our economics correspondent Richard Partington. Despite an escalating price war between lenders cutting the cost of remortgaging in recent days, economists at the US investment bank Goldman Sachs said many UK households would still experience a dramatic leap in repayments compared with the deals they were leaving behind. In what has been described as a Tory mortgage timebomb by Rishi Sunak\u2019s critics, just over 1.5m households are expected to reach the end of cheaper deals in 2024 \u2013 with an increase in annual housing costs of about \u00a31,800 for the typical family, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank. As fixed-rate deals expire and households absorb the biggest hit to their finances in the postwar age, with inflation and tax rises taking their toll on spending power, borrowers are turning to a range of measures to cope with the increased costs, from renting out rooms in their homes to drawing down pensions early and even postponing having children. Anthony Codling, housing analyst at RBC Capital markets, said: The demise of the UK housing market is somewhat over reported. The Halifax reported today that house prices rose by 1.7% in 2023, an increase of \u00a34,800. Most, including us, thought house prices would fall during 2023, and most think they will fall in 2024, but not us. With rising wages, falling inflation, falling mortgage rates, and increasing talk of election related housing stimulus packages we expect house prices to rise in 2024. Our pessimism was misplaced in 2023, and we don\u2019t want to make the same mistake twice. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. House prices in the UK rose for the third consecutive month in December, reflecting a shortage of properties on the market, according to mortgage lender Halifax. It added that with mortgage rates easing, confidence among buyers may improve in the coming months. The cost of an average home rose by 1.1% to \u00a3287,105, just over \u00a33,000 more than in November and the highest level since March, Halifax said. This comes after monthly gains of 0.6% and 1.2% in November and October. Compared with December 2022, values were up 1.7%, the first annual growth in eight months, following a 0.8% drop in November. Kim Kinnaird, director of Halifax Mortgages, said: The housing market beat expectations in 2023 and grew by 1.7% on an annual basis. The average property price is now \u00a34,800 higher than it was in December 2022. Whilst it\u2019s encouraging that we saw growth in the last three months of the year, this was preceded with property price falls for six consecutive months between April and September. The growth we have seen is likely being driven by a shortage of properties on the market, rather than the strength of buyer demand. That said, with mortgage rates continuing to ease, we may see an increase in confidence from buyers over the coming months. Across all the UK regions, Northern Ireland recorded the strongest house price growth in 2023, as properties increased in value by 4.1% to \u00a3192,153. Scotland saw property prices increase by 2.6% to \u00a3205,170. At the other end of the scale, the south east fell most sharply, houses there now average \u00a3376,804, a drop of \u00a317,755 or 4.5%. Halifax expects prices to fall by between 2% and 4% this year as many still struggle to afford the sharply higher mortgage costs compared with recent years following a series of Bank of England rate hikes. The question is when will the central bank start cutting rates? Financial markets are betting that the first reduction will come by May. Kinnaird explained: As we move through 2024, the UK property market will continue to reflect the wider economic uncertainty and buyers and sellers are likely to be naturally cautious when considering making a move. While wage growth is now above inflation, helping to ease cost of living pressures for some and improving housing affordability, interest rates are likely to remain elevated for as long as inflation remains markedly above the Bank of England\u2019s target. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: The housing market saw a remarkably strong finish to the year, as buyer and seller confidence was boosted by three consecutive interest rate holds and the growing belief that the next move in rates will be downwards. Increased competitiveness among lenders leads to lower mortgage rates and we find ourselves in the midst of a price war. With HSBC launching the headline-grabbing 3.94% five-year fix and reductions from Halifax, NatWest, TSB and other lenders, the gloves really are off. With 2023 being a disappointing year in terms of amount of business done, lenders are keen to get this year off to a cracking start. Increased competition, rates aside, may also lead to lenders broadening criteria to attract business with longer mortgage terms or greater flexibility to allow certain variable incomes. Although those remortgaging this year will still see an increase in their payments, the pain will not be as bad as it could have been. Later today we will get the US non-farm payrolls report for December, which is expected to show that the economy added 150,00 jobs following November\u2019s 199,000 increase. The Agenda 9.30am GMT: S&amp;P Global/CIPS Construction PMI for December 10am GMT: Eurozone inflation for December (forecast: 2.9%) 1.30pm GMT: US Non-farm payrolls jobs report for December (forecast: 150,000)"

            "date": "2024-01-23T14:06:21Z",
            "content": "How do you tell the story of Rob Peace? He was an exceptionally smart Black kid living in New Jersey, the product of a hard-working mother and a father who was convicted of murder when he was seven. His intellect and interest in science took him all the way to Yale on a scholarship, but circumstance took him back home and to a period of dealing drugs, a bright star crashing to earth, shot to death at the age of 30. It\u2019s a horrible, haunting tale, told by his old roommate Jeff Hobbs in the book The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace, and now adapted to the big screen by Chiwetel Ejiofor, in his sophomore feature as director. Trying to find a way to sensitively bring it to life, to weave a way through a maze of assumptions and cliches, is an unenviable trek. And while Rob Peace, premiering at Sundance, isn\u2019t without missteps, it\u2019s a film made with enough tact and empathy to offset alarm, a robust follow-up to Ejiofor\u2019s debut, the moving Malawi-set drama The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind. Like that film, it\u2019s earnestly told and full of big emotion, sometimes to a fault, and further legitimises Ejiofor as a dedicated director with a sweeping commercial eye. The film might be for sale at the festival, but it comes with what seems to be a substantive budget and some small roles for big names \u2013 Mary J Blige as Peace\u2019s mother, Camila Cabello as his girlfriend, Ejiofor himself as his father \u2013 and with an enthused and reactive premiere in the bag, it surely won\u2019t be on the shelf for long. While pre-publicity might have focused on those juicier names, it\u2019s the relative newcomer Jay Will as Rob, in one of the festival\u2019s most indelible star-making turns, who should have everyone talking after. He\u2019s a total knockout, brightening every room he enters, easily convincing us of the buoyant charm that those around him were so spellbound by. Rob is shown to be intimidatingly intelligent, using science to make sense of the senseless world around him, as well as an enduring, often naive, optimist. He carried the weight of his father\u2019s sentence on his shoulders, trying to find ways, and funds, to prove his innocence while working his way through a college that already demanded so much from him. Will shows us how he manoeuvred through these trials, knowing how to fit in without ever forgetting who he was, an astonishingly confident performance from someone who ably carries a difficult film on his untrained shoulders. But as much as we, as audience members, might trust Will\u2019s ability to guide us through, Ejiofor\u2019s writing doesn\u2019t often feel as confident of him. He scatters some mostly unnecessary bits of voiceover that frequently tell us either what we already know or what Will\u2019s absorbing face can already convey. Other scraps of dialogue feel similarly extraneous or overstated, clumsily vocalising the film\u2019s themes and Rob\u2019s struggle in ways that feel inelegant, too much telling over showing. The script sees characters repeatedly reminding us of Rob\u2019s innate goodness, something we already see not only in the raw facts of his story but again in Will\u2019s unending charisma. Ejiofor is a mostly impressive director but he overcooks at times \u2013 the sun shining between an overscored, Nicholas Sparks-esque first kiss, some graceless sped up or slowed down scenes of action \u2013 and like with his writing, sometimes the direction could have benefited from a bit less blare and bit more subtlety. Because for a lot of the film, he actually displays a knack for knowing when to pull back. Will\u2019s time at Yale avoids an excess of conflict, with microaggressions shown in brief but effective bursts, and his final descent told plainly without exploitation, Ejiofor knowing by then that the story will tell itself without a heavy hand. While Blige is a little flat, Ejiofor makes for an effectively conflicted father, never becoming the bad dad cliche he could have been, wanting the best for his son while also demanding so much of him. Cabello is fine but underserved, the film far too busy to spend enough time on their romance, leaving a final stroke of emotion between the pair a little underpowered. A finer movie would have seen a more delicate touch employed throughout but Rob Peace still avoids enough traps for it to land its final blow, Ejiofor tracing his downfall as the result of grander forces at play, the result of living in a country where true social mobility is close to impossible. Rob is turned from stereotype to person, thanks to Will\u2019s incredible work and Ejiofor\u2019s unwavering commitment to capturing a full life, supported by Rob\u2019s mother off screen. It\u2019s an involving yet troubling tribute. Rob Peace screened at the Sundance film festival, and is in UK and Irish cinemas from 6 September."

            "date": "2024-01-28T12:00:05Z",
            "content": "Nine months after I moved to Dali, in the autumn of 2020, I finally set off to climb Cangshan, the high mountain which towers over this valley in southwest China. Each morning, I had looked up at the top of its imposing ridge line, 2,000m above the village of Silver Bridge, north of Dali\u2019s historic old town, that for a while I called home. Eighteen glacial gorges separated the 19 peaks, each carved by a running stream. Ever since moving there, I had fantasised about standing on top of that mountain. Reaching its summit had become an objective I fixated on. Scaling it would be healing, I had convinced myself. I wasn\u2019t alone in that outlook. It\u2019s the quest for personal change that draws so many escapees from China\u2019s cities to this rural valley. Cangshan (the \u201cverdant mountain\u201d) is a spectacular, 44km-long massif, carpeted by lush, evergreen forest, hugging the western shore of a crystalline lake and looming over a valley in the foothills of the eastern Himalaya, near the border with Myanmar. Each evening, I\u2019d sit and watch the sun setting over them from my farmhouse, casting rays of pink, yellow and ochre through the clouds that rolled off the ridge line. There\u2019s a saying in Chinese: \u201cThe mountains are high, the emperor far away.\u201d It speaks of escape from the urban nexus of power, of self-exile in rural climes. The valley of Dali in Yunnan province, far away from Beijing, where I had lived for the past seven years, has a storied history as just such a refuge. The progenitors of Dali\u2019s native ethnicity, the Bai people, supposedly came here fleeing warring dynasties in the north. In the modern age, it\u2019s become an increasingly trendy destination for those looking to leave the city and get back to nature. Its ancient old town and surrounding villages are dotted with urban-dwellers renting cottages and farmhouses, looking to get away from it all. And I was one of them. Around the time I made the move to Dali, a new Chinese buzzword was starting to appear online: \u201cinvolution\u201d. The Chinese, neijuan, literally means to be \u201crolled up inside\u201d. If you worked 12 hours a day, you were rolled up by over-work culture. If you were a student whose parents jam-packed your weekends with back-to-back classes, you were rolled up by the education system. If you were commuting for two hours to pay off a shoebox apartment and buy a car so you could attract a partner, you were rolled up by social conventions. One blog post likened neijuan to the prisoner\u2019s dilemma, using an image of a concert where those in the front rows stood up to get a better view. If everyone sat, the view would be the same \u2013 but because some were standing, everyone behind them had to as well. Not social evolution, but involution. A solution was proposed: instead of standing or sitting, lie down. The word used for this, tangping, literally meant to lie flat, but signalled a deeper opting out of the system. If the game was rigged and social mobility impossible, why even bother? Quit the rat race; break the cycle. The most extreme form was to escape the city altogether. If material goals weren\u2019t fulfilling, maybe there was a different mountain to climb. Dali was already jokingly dubbed the \u201ccapital of lying flat\u201d. Others called it \u201cDalifornia\u201d, for its good weather and chilled vibes. The back-to-the-land trend was a direct reversal of everything upwardly mobile Chinese used to hold dear. For decades, those born in the countryside had wanted only to escape its poverty. Yet for the generations born in China\u2019s megacities, some wanted to return to the soil where their forefathers had come from. After 40 years of urbanisation, the flow was reversing. Obviously, I\u2019m not Chinese. I was a privileged, white Brit descending on the village. Still, I found myself just as burnt out by life in Beijing as my fellow urbanites. Born and raised in Oxford, after graduating from university in 2007, I travelled to teach in China for a summer, caught the China bug and stayed for the next 15 years. Back then, Beijing was one of the world\u2019s most exciting cities. Yet after 2017, something shifted. As the state veered towards authoritarianism, China was tightening rather than opening. The city no longer felt like the hub of a dynamic nation, but the heart of a police state. Or perhaps what was deteriorating was me. I was becoming the clich\u00e9 of the bitter expat. Old friends left Beijing; I was having relationship difficulties with my long-term partner, which I chose to ignore. Without a new project after my first book was published, I was feeling listless about work. I was in a rut. Then came the knock on my door: the building I lived in was an illegal structure and had to be demolished. If you had asked me if I wanted to go, I would have said no. I needed the push to realise something had to change. We called off our engagement on the second day of 2020 and within a fortnight I was on the train to Dali. Here, I met other urban transplants, each seeking their own Shangri-la in which to reinvent themselves in. The hippies and yuppies, bohemians and bourgeois, environmentalists and survivalists, homeschoolers and retirees, Taoists and Buddhists, psychonauts and oneironauts, dissidents and digital nomads. Refugees of modernity, opting out of China\u2019s honking high-rises to live far from the centre of state power, trying to be free in an unfree country. In the process, as coffee shops and yoga studios popped up around the valley to cater for us, we were changing the very rural escape we sought. Above it all loomed the mountain. In October, I packed my tent and set off at first light, to scale the crisscross of donkey paths that snake their way up. It took a full day to reach the summit, at a steep and gruelling incline. The final stretch was tough going, through a bamboo forest that grew dense around the narrow path, more of a scramble than a hike. My legs were starting to give out, and I worried about fading light. Then, out of nowhere, the path levelled off and a large pool of water stretched before me, lined by silver fir trees. I had reached my destination. The mountain ridge was still 200m higher, but I was camping overnight at a series of lakes just below it. Next morning, I made the final climb before sunrise. Certainly, I felt a sense of satisfaction at the top. A physical task was completed. But emotionally, it was a let down. I had dreamed of the symbolism of this climb. Yet as I watched the sun rise over the valley, as beautiful as I expected it to be, I felt no revelation. I had projected much significance on to Dali. It was on this mountain that I was convinced I would be restored, remedied. The appeal had been in its isolation. To remove myself from society and city, out of a romantic, wounded self-image. Yet isolation is internal. I realised the answers I had searched for weren\u2019t up here in these forested hills. Dusk was falling on the second night when I climbed down and reached home. Now, back in my courtyard and looking up at the mountains, I saw them in a new light. It was their mystery that had first drawn me to Dali; the prospect of their power to transform. But I knew the work of finding mental calm, true serenity, was here to be done on the ground. I started cooking, fixed up my rented farmhouse, grew vegetables and spent time outdoors. Hobbies, too: music, running, archery and tai chi. But my new interests and the idyllic locale alone didn\u2019t make me happy. I had changed location, but physical change was not enough: I needed to change my mind. I started talk therapy, over Zoom, and learned tools and tricks to regulate my emotions. Nature, spirituality and meditation replaced screens, scrolling and constant comparison in my daily routine. I knew I would not stay in Dali for ever \u2013 it was a false utopia. My goal was to be in the middle of chaotic traffic or a major crisis and still be able to access inner calm. After three years in the valley, I left China. I live in New York now, setting up a new life all over again. But I\u2019m trying to keep some of the spirit of Dali alive, and its lessons: from finding inner refuge where I can, to remembering I\u2019m not the centre of the universe. Sometimes, maybe, lying flat for a while. As told to Michael Segalov The Mountains Are High: A Year of Escape and Discovery in Rural China, by Alec Ash, is out on 8 February (Scribe, \u00a316.99).

            "date": "2024-01-09T20:06:36Z",
            "content": "Anthony Blinken has reaffirmed the United States\u2019 \u201cunique bond\u201d with Israel, and rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza but told his hosts in Tel Aviv that other regional powers have made clear that a pathway to the realisation of Palestinian political rights is essential for peace in the region. Hinting at having held difficult talks with Israeli officials on Tuesday, the US secretary of state said the exceptional friendship between the two countries demanded that the US be \u201cas forthright as possible when the choices matter most\u201d and called for Israel to make \u201chard decisions\u201d. Israel has so far ruled out calls to allow the internationally recognised Palestinian Authority to govern both Gaza and the occupied West Bank \u2013 Washington\u2019s preferred option \u2013 and instead suggested some form of governance involving local powerbrokers or clans, with the Israel Defense Forces playing a significant supervisory role. \u201cIsrael must stop taking steps that undercut the Palestinians\u2019 ability to govern themselves effectively,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cIsrael must be a partner of the Palestinian leaders who are willing to lead their people in living side by side in peace with Israel.\u201d Blinken said Arab leaders across the Middle East were ready to help with the reconstruction of Gaza, which has sustained massive destruction during the war, but only \u201cthrough a regional approach that includes a pathway to a Palestinian state\u201d. \u201cCritical to ending once and for all the cycle of violence \u2026 is the realisation of Palestinian political rights. That was a very clear message wherever I went,\u201d said Blinken, who has visited Turkey, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on his tour of the region. Blinken\u2019s tour is aimed at reaching a consensus on Gaza\u2019s future and stopping an escalation of the war across the Middle East. Earlier in the day, US officials said Blinken told Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, that his forces must avoid inflicting further harm on civilians in Gaza. Matthew Miller, a state department spokesperson, said Blinken had reaffirmed US support for Israel\u2019s attempts to stop any repeat of the Hamas attack of 7 October but \u201cstressed the importance of avoiding further civilian harm and protecting civilian infrastructure in Gaza\u201d. However there was no sign of any let-up in the violence in Gaza nor across the disputed border between Israel and Lebanon, where there have been intensifying clashes for weeks between Israel and Hezbollah, the militant Islamist organisation. Hezbollah targeted a key Israeli base on Tuesday, declaring the attack part of its response to recent high-level Israeli assassinations in Lebanon. Shortly afterwards, Israel killed four more Hezbollah members, including one at the funeral of a senior commander in the group\u2019s elite Radwan force who had been killed the day before. Israel has traded cross-border fire with Hezbollah for three months and, though analysts say both sides want to avoid a war, a minor miscalculation by either side could trigger a wave of violence across the Middle East. In Gaza, there were reports of multiple airstrikes overnight in Khan Younis and Rafah, the biggest cities in the south of the territory, which are both crowded with internally displaced people. At least 23,210 people, mostly women and children, have been killed during Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, according to its health ministry. Swaths of the territory have been devastated, with most of its 2.3 million population displaced and facing an acute humanitarian crisis. The Israeli army described \u201cexpanded ground operations including airstrikes\u201d in Khan Younis, and said nine soldiers had been killed in battle in Gaza, some of the heaviest losses announced since Israel launched its offensive after the Hamas attacks that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Hamas also took about 250 hostages. Israel says 132 of them remain captive, though at least 25 of these are thought to have been killed. Israel\u2019s military casualties in its offensive have reached 185. Six of those who died on Monday did so in a single explosion when trying to destroy a tunnel dug by Hamas under central Gaza\u2019s al-Bureij refugee camp. The blast may have been caused by a shell fired from an Israeli tank, local media reported. Blinken voiced hope that, after the war, Israel could push on with its efforts towards regional integration, following its US-brokered normalisation deals with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and other states. He also dismissed a case filed by South Africa against Israel at the international court of justice accusing it of genocide. Blinken called the allegations \u201cmeritless\u201d and said they distracted from efforts to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza. It was \u201cparticularly galling\u201d as Hamas had called for Israel\u2019s annihilation, he added. The US has offered staunch support to Israel since the outbreak of its war with Hamas three months ago, but Netanyahu\u2019s refusal to offer detailed public plans for the governance of Gaza when Israel\u2019s military offensive ends has angered Washington. Netanyahu, whose hold on power depends on far-right support, has ignored US pressure to rein in ministers who have called for the mass voluntary emigration of Palestinians from Gaza. Washington has said such rhetoric is \u201cinflammatory and unacceptable\u201d. Blinken said he was \u201ccrystal clear\u201d that Palestinians must be able to return to their homes \u201cas soon as conditions allow\u201d and said the US rejected any proposal for settling them outside the territory. Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, said on Tuesday that the 7 October attack \u201ccame after an attempt to marginalise the Palestinian cause\u201d and called on Muslim states \u201cto support the resistance with weapons, because this is \u2026 not the battle of the Palestinian people alone\u201d. Haniyeh was speaking in Qatar, where he is based. Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli police confirmed three people were killed on Monday during a raid on Tulkarm to arrest a \u201cwanted terrorist\u201d. Israeli army raids and settler attacks in the West Bank have killed at least 333 people since 7 October, according to the Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry."

            "content": "A multi-faith peace march is due to be held in London on Sunday, aimed at easing the bitterness and tension over the Israel-Gaza war. The midday march from Trafalgar Square to Parliament Square and back is one of a series of events due to be held in the next few days and weeks in solidarity with people affected by conflict in Israel and Palestine. Gatherings are also planned in Birmingham and Oxford. Together for Humanity, supported by a coalition of charities, community organisations and faith groups, is coordinating the events. The peace march in London is organised by Quakers in Britain and Plum Village UK, a Buddhist community. \u201cThis is about people of all faiths and none having the space to mourn all civilians affected by the conflict,\u201d said Brendan Cox, co-founder of Together for Humanity. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to stand against antisemitism and anti-Muslim hate, and to show those who seek to divide us that the vast majority of people in this country don\u2019t discriminate when it comes to compassion.\u201d There will also be a gathering, organised by charity The Oxford Foundation at Oxford town hall on Sunday, to remember those who have lost their lives in the conflict in Israel and Palestine, and in others around the world. Magen Inon, a teacher living in London whose parents Yakov and Bilha were killed by Hamas in the 7 October attack, is backing the events. \u201cSince the murder of my parents, my family and I have felt immense pain,\u201d he said. \u201cThis pain has been compounded by those who have sought to further division and spread hate here in the UK and elsewhere. \u201cI\u2019m calling everyone who believes all people deserve basic human rights to come together and we will be in a better position to find to solution to the conflict. Either both sides win, or everybody loses.\u201d In a peace vigil outside Downing Street in December, Inon shared a platform with Hamze Awawde, a Palestinian peace activist who lives in Ramallah in the West Bank. Inon said at the vigil that people needed to recognise the suffering and loss of lives on both sides and to \u201cset aside fear and hate and to be hopeful that a better future is possible.\u201d Awawde said: \u201cWe can and must stand opposed to hatred \u2013 both Islamophobia and antisemitism \u2013 and mourn the loss of all innocent lives in this terrible conflict \u2013 Palestinians and Israelis, Muslims and Jews. \u201cSeeing people of different faiths and backgrounds come together, not simply in spite of their differences, but because of them, fills me with a deep hope that we can work towards a lasting peace.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-21T19:01:42Z",
            "content": "Without flags, placards or chants, hundreds of people joined a silent multi-faith peace walk in London on Sunday in response to the Israel-Gaza war. Muslims, Jews, Christians, Hindus and Buddhists walked side-by-side from Trafalgar Square to Parliament Square and back in solidarity with people affected by the conflict in the Middle East. \u201cWar hurts our hearts,\u201d said Rabbi Alexandra Wright, the president of Liberal Judaism and senior rabbi of the Liberal Jewish Synagogue, as faith leaders read prayers on the steps of Trafalgar Square before setting off on a one-mile walk alongside non-religious people. \u201cWe pray for those who are still held hostage and for their release from captivity, and for the thousands in Israel and Gaza, who have been displaced from their homes ... \u201cWe pray for peace in the region, for the safe passage of humanitarian aid to all those who need it, for the wisdom and moral courage of world leaders, and for civility here in the UK, and across the west, among those who may find themselves on opposite sides of this conflict.\u201d She added that the war was \u201cgeographically far from us, but \u2026 felt even here, like the ground ruptures of an earthquake\u201d. Her words were echoed by Rehena Harilall, from Plum Village UK, a Buddhist group that organised the walk alongside Quakers in Britain, who warned against the \u201cretaliatory violence\u201d taking place in the UK, where antisemitism and Islamophobia have reportedly grown since the 7 October attacks in Israel. She said: \u201cToday\u2019s event emerged as a result of the escalating violence in over 30 wars and armed conflicts around the world, exemplified by what is happening between Israel and Palestine; the rising destruction of human life, displacement, hostage taking, unjust detentions [and] the growing retaliatory violence and demonisation of others taking place right here with the rise in antisemitism and Islamophobia.\u201d Imam Asim Hafiz, an Islamic religious adviser to the Ministry of Defence, also addressed the crowd, saying collective prayer and reflection were needed to establish peace. Representatives from the Sikh, Quaker, Buddhist, Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed, Jain and Zoroastrian faiths also read prayers during the event coordinated by Together for Humanity and supported by a coalition of charities and community organisations. Gatherings are also planned in Birmingham and Oxford as part of a series of events promoting peace over the next few days. Laura Marks, who co-founded Nisa-Nashim, a Jewish and Muslim women\u2019s network and one of the organisations involved in the event, was among the hundreds listening in the square. \u201cThe idea behind the movement is to bring unity to a very, very fractured world,\u201d she said. \u201cThe faith communities are particularly fractured in light of the Israel-Gaza conflict so there\u2019s not enough voices saying \u2018we need peace, we need harmony\u2019. \u201cParticularly in Britain, we need to be working together, with antisemitism and Islamophobia spiking at incredible levels, it\u2019s time to get people to come together and keep the conflict off our streets.\u201d As the diverse group including children and elderly people embarked on the walk, many carried signs saying: \u201cPeace is every step: walking together in silence for non-violence, reconciliation and peace.\u201d The group wore knitted white flowers symbolising peace and included those who were not religious. Hella Ehlers, 79, from London, said she was agnostic and had joined the walk due to the \u201cdangerous situation\u201d in the world. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for reflection and I\u2019m sick and tired of the divisive discussions that are going on. What we need to focus on is the human tragedy; it\u2019s not about pro-Israel or pro-Palestine,\u201d she said. Myles Brown and Nouri, 34-year-olds from London, said they were not religious but wanted to see people come together and find common ground. Nouri, who did want to give his surname, added: \u201cI came to show ongoing support for peace in Palestine and because of the idea of hate marches pushed by Suella Braverman. It was so easy to see by being in the crowd that people are rarely marching for hate. \u201cAnd, secondly, it\u2019s so easy to forget after the really big marches of a few months ago the nature of the conflict, so it\u2019s continuing to come out and show that people here care.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-13T19:23:18Z",
            "content": "A prolonged conflict in the Red Sea and escalating tensions across the Middle East risk having devastating effects on the global economy, reigniting inflation and disrupting energy supplies, some of the world\u2019s leading economists warn this weekend. Before a statement expected on Monday by Rishi Sunak in the House of Commons about UK and US airstrikes on Houthi sites in Yemen, economists at the World Bank say the crisis now threatens to feed through into higher interest rates, lower growth, persistent inflation and greater geopolitical uncertainty. After a second night of strikes against the Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen, President Joe Biden said that the US had sent a private message to Tehran that \u201cwe\u2019re confident we\u2019re well prepared\u201d. Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn on Saturday, on his way to Camp David, Biden declined to go into further detail. But there is now growing concern in government circles in London and Washington that as Sunak and Biden fight for re-election, events in the Middle East could dash what had looked like improved prospects for economic recovery and therefore their chances at the ballot box. While the airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen have broad cross-party support at Westminster, Sunak will face questions from anxious MPs about a prolonged conflict and the longer-term plan for Middle East peace. Some leftwing Labour MPs are expected to put Keir Starmer under pressure over why he backed the military strikes having said that he would only support such action after parliament had voted in favour of it. Biden also faced pushback from progressives in his own party, already deeply opposed to US military support for Israeli action in Gaza. California congressman Ro Khanna said: \u201cThe president needs to come to Congress before launching a strike against the Houthis in Yemen and involving us in another Middle East conflict.\u201d In its latest report on global economic prospects, the World Bank says the Middle East crisis, with the war in Ukraine, has created real dangers. \u201cConflict escalation could lead to surging energy prices, with broader implications for global activity and inflation,\u201d it says. \u201cOther risks include financial stress related to real interest rates, persistent inflation, weaker than expected growth in China, further trade fragmentation and climate change-related disasters.\u201d It adds: \u201cRecent attacks on commercial vessels transiting the Red Sea have already started to disrupt key shipping routes, eroding slack in supply networks and increasing the likelihood of inflationary bottlenecks. In a setting of escalating conflicts, energy supplies could also be substantially disrupted, leading to a spike in energy prices. This would have significant spillovers to other commodity prices and heighten geopolitical and economic uncertainty, which in turn could dampen investment and lead to a further weakening of growth.\u201d John Llewellyn, a partner at Independent Economics and a former chief economist of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), said: \u201cThis has escalated to become a serious problem.\u201d He put the probability of serious disruptions to world trade at 30%, up from 10% a week ago: \u201cThere is a horrible and inevitable progression that could see the situation in the Red Sea spread to the strait of Hormuz and the wider Middle East.\u201d An economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Ben Zaranko, told the Observer the crisis underlined the perils of the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, using limited fiscal headroom to promise tax cuts. \u201cIf we have learned anything over the last few years it is that bad shocks can and do come along,\u201d Zaranko said. \u201cSpending every single penny of \u2018headroom\u2019 on tax cuts leaves him no room for manoeuvre if a nasty shock comes along and the outlook deteriorates.\u201d The conflict in the Middle East widened on Thursday when dozens of British and US strikes hit Houthi sites in Yemen. The strikes were in retaliation for attacks on vessels passing through the Red Sea, which have paralysed shipping in one of the world\u2019s most important maritime channels. The Houthis say they are targeting only Israel-affiliated vessels, in an effort to support Palestinians in Gaza, but many of their targets had no known links to Israel. They have also fired missiles at Israel\u2019s territory. A US strike on a radar site in Yemen on Friday night prompted Houthi threats of a \u201cstrong and effective response\u201d to international attacks, and fuelled fears of regional escalation in a conflict already playing out across multiple borders. Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had had no significant impact on the Houthis\u2019 ability to prevent vessels from passing through the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. The top UN official for Yemen, special envoy Hans Grundberg, warned of \u201cserious concerns\u201d about stability and the fragile peace efforts in Yemen, which has endured years of civil war. The Houthis are just one of several Iran-aligned groups across the region, including in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon, which are attacking targets either inside Israel, or which they say are linked to Israel. Hezbollah in Lebanon represents perhaps the most severe threat. Farea Al-Muslimi, from the Chatham House Middle East programme, said: \u201cThe Houthis are far more savvy, prepared and well-equipped than many western commentators realise. Their recklessness, and willingness to escalate in the face of a challenge, is always underrated.\u201d William Bain, the British Chamber of Commerce\u2019s trade expert, said: \u201cAbout 500,000 containers were going through the Suez canal in November and that had dropped 60% to 200,000 in December.\u201d Ships are taking different routes, but that has raised costs, with a container that cost $1,500 in November rising to $4,000 in December. \u201cIf things get worse, it only adds to the disruption, and the cost of containers will go up and global trade will fall further,\u201d he said. Economists, many of them arriving in Davos this week for the annual World Economic Forum, have become increasingly worried that many of the world\u2019s major economies may now suffer a recession this year. They fear that central banks will make only modest cuts to borrowing costs, adding to the cost of living crisis faced by millions of households. The prospect of higher oil prices could convince central banks to hold firm and maintain high interest rates for a longer period than currently expected. Liam Byrne, chair of the Commons business and trade select committee, said: \u201cThere\u2019s now a real risk that a Red Sea battle will push up prices, just as inflation was beginning to fall. The World Bank is already warning that global supply chains are once more in peril \u2026 not least because this new struggle in Suez comes as drought is cutting trade through the Panama canal. Two of the world\u2019s five keys to trade are now in real jeopardy.\u201d"

            "content": "The pace of US economic growth slowed in the last three months of 2023, but far less than had been expected, underlining the continued resilience of the economy. The commerce department reported on Thursday that US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of economic health \u2013 grew at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the final quarter of the year, down from 4.9% in the previous quarter but in line with pre-pandemic growth, and well ahead of the 2% economists had expected. Robust consumer spending and government outlays contributed to the growth. The Federal Reserve has been attempting to cool economic activity in order to bring down inflation. Since March 2022 the Fed has increased rates to a 22-year high and held them there. Inflation has fallen from a high of 9% in June 2022 to 3.4%. The rate rises have increased the cost of borrowing and many \u2013 including the Fed \u2013 had expected a subsequent slowdown in economic activity to lead to layoffs. But so far the Fed appears to be on course for what it has termed a \u201csoft landing\u201d. Hiring has remained robust \u2013 unemployment hovers at close to a 50-year low \u2013 and while growth has slowed, consumers have continued to spend, the US economy has weathered the rate rises and stock markets have hit record highs. \u201cThe Fed \u2013 so far \u2013 has managed to strangle inflation without strangling the economy,\u201d said Dan North, senior economist with Allianz Trade Americas. North said the Fed rate rises were still working their way through the economy and he expected 2024 to be a year of slow growth \u201cbut we are not using the recession word yet\u201d. Polling since the end of the pandemic shutdowns has consistently shown that consumers are pessimistic about the state of the economy. There are signs that the gloom may be lifting. Last week the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched monthly consumer sentiment index rose 9.1 points to 78.8, its biggest monthly advance since 2005. \u201cConsumer views were supported by confidence that inflation has turned a corner and strengthening income expectations,\u201d said Joanne Hsu, the University of Michigan\u2019s director of surveys."

            "date": "2024-01-28T17:42:02Z",
            "content": "After an astonishing 28-run victory against India in the first Test in Hyderabad, one sealed by the debutant Tom Hartley\u2019s stellar seven\u2011wicket haul, Ben Stokes was in no doubt: this was England\u2019s finest performance in his two years as captain. It was impossible to quibble, given both India\u2019s 11-year run of dominance at home and the attack that got them there. This was England\u2019s 14th win from 19 under Stokes and his head coach, Brendon McCullum, set up by Ollie Pope\u2019s 196 with the bat before Hartley rolled India for 202 all out, the home side having been set 231 in the fourth innings. \u201cThis is definitely the No 1 win since I have been captain,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been part of some amazing games, had some incredible victories. But considering where we are and who we were playing against, the position we found ourselves going into our second innings, I feel this is our best since I\u2019ve been captain; our greatest triumph.\u201d The position mentioned was perilous, England 190 runs behind India at the midway point of the match and then staring down the barrel of a heavy defeat when they stumbled to 163 for five. But for Pope, marshalling the lower order to put 420 all out on the board by lunch on the fourth day, India would have been the side 1-0 up. Stokes said: \u201cI have been lucky enough to play a lot of Tests in the subcontinent with Joe Root and seen some special innings from him but I think the situation we found ourselves in, some of the shots he played \u2013 that for me that is the greatest innings that has ever been played by an English batter in India.\u201d While Pope changed the direction of travel, it was Hartley who took England home after lunch on the fourth day. Despite a mauling on the first evening\u2013 one in which Stokes persisted, to the detriment of his runs column \u2013 and Jack Leach\u2019s struggle with a knee injury, the 24-year-old Lancashire left\u2011armer stepped up for his captain. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go how he wanted [on day one] but I was committed to giving him that long spell,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cWhether or not that is a big reason he\u2019s got seven-for I don\u2019t know. It is just a lesson to quite a lot of people that if you are saying stuff to people and want them to believe in it, you have really got to back it up by your actions. \u201cIt is my first time as captain in India. I may not seem it but I am a great observer of the game. I learned a lot from our first innings in the field, and from how the Indian spinners operated, and tried to take a lot of that into the second innings. \u201cI am absolutely thrilled. Hartley on debut taking nine wickets [in the match], Ollie Pope\u2019s first game back after surgery. It has been an incredible effort by everyone.\u201d Stokes was similarly returning after an operation, with the left knee that went under the knife before Christmas passing its first significant test. This included his run-out of the dangerous Ravindra Jadeja on the fourth evening, Stokes sprinting, diving and ultimately nailing the stumps with a remarkable reverse\u2011flicked throw. Jadeja could well emerge as a doubt for the second Test that starts in Visakhapatnam on Friday, having felt his hamstring on the way off. Similarly Leach is likely to be struggling despite bowling through the pain of a haematoma in his left knee and delivering one breakthrough during the denouement. Shoaib Bashir has at least arrived in the country in reserve, the 20\u2011year\u2011old Somerset spinner joining England on Sunday following his drawn-out visa complications."

            "content": "\u201cLife is a rollercoaster,\u201d Kirian Rodr\u00edguez said. When second division Las Palmas reported for pre-season last summer, the midfielder told them something wasn\u2019t right: he was tired, didn\u2019t want to eat and couldn\u2019t sleep. His spleen was inflamed, his kidneys hurt and his calcium levels were too high. Doctors removed a cyst and the results of the biopsy revealed a Hodgkin lymphoma, cancer. It was August 2022 and he was 26. He underwent six sessions of chemotherapy, crossing them out on a calendar. There were pills and injections, he felt weak and his hair fell out. But the worst thing, he said later, was the fear that he wouldn\u2019t play football again, which is what really makes him happy. It\u2019s what makes a lot of other people happy too. \u201cCancer is something associated with death; I had to be the strong one,\u201d Kirian told ESPN. The day he announced his illness, sitting smiling in a press conference surrounded by his teammates, he told them in a calm, steady voice that broke only once and only briefly, that he didn\u2019t want pity and that he would still be there, still shouting from the stands, still the pain in the arse he always was. Above all, he told them he would play again. There was no hurry, but he set a date. Mentally, he needed to: a public promise there to be fulfilled, it would be done, the positivism part of the process and consciously chosen. The winter window would the best they had had because he would be back. Two days later, in the hospital waiting room before his first chemo session, Kirian overheard a woman talking about that footballer with the same illness, unaware he was sitting opposite. He bit his tongue for a bit until he heard her mention how he wasn\u2019t likely to play again. \u201cSe\u00f1ora,\u201d he said, \u201cat least let me try.\u201d The treatment continued and so did the training sessions at Barranco Seco, where he had been going daily for a decade, a kid from Tenerife who joined them as a teenager. His hair slowly returned, his strength too. \u201cThe day I\u2019m cured will be the day the fourth official holds up the board with my number on,\u201d he said. In November 2022, he completed his chemo cycle; in January 2023, he was given the all clear; and then, in April, the fourth official did. On a Sunday night in Zaragoza, 271 days later, Las Palmas\u2019s No 20 stepped back on to a football pitch. Kirian Rodr\u00edguez Concepci\u00f3n, the best signing they could have ever made. This Saturday afternoon, 258 days after that, Kirian\u2019s number went up again. This time, he headed back in the other direction. There were four minutes left and his work here was done when he handed over the captain\u2019s armband and made his way to a standing ovation. It is not just that he he played again; it is that he is playing like this, in a higher league and better than ever before. He had just produced a performance, an afternoon so good, virtually perfect in virtually every way, it was hard to know which moment to choose, which snapshot best expressed everything he is and all he has become. Maybe it was the first goal, a minute-long move unfolding at his feet: from Kirian to Mika M\u00e1rmol to Kirian to Sergi Cardona to Kirian to Alberto Moleiro to Kirian to finish, not so much a shot as another pass, this time into the net. Or the way he celebrated it, pointing at the 20-year-old, born in the same town, who he is guiding and who had laid it off. Maybe it was the way he celebrated the second, embracing Juanma Herzog, the 19-year-old Canarian, like him, who had just scored on his debut and was in tears. Or how he swept in the third in a 3-0 victory, spotlight again ceded to the player who played the pass, all of it about Javi Mu\u00f1oz. Maybe it was the 65 passes of his own; the moment of complicity with Dani Parejo, the little smile and a word when his opponent hit the bar; the calm authority with which he ran this game and every game, the complete control he appears to have over everything. His is a strength worn lightly, almost gently, not imposed, the group above all else \u2013 and it was there too in the moment that most stood out, in the way that the fans stood up for him and the way that he stood up to them, defending his teammates. Six days earlier, Las Palmas had been defeated in the Canary Island derby, second division Tenerife knocking them out of the Copa del Rey 2-0. Kirian had played just 20 minutes. It had been their worst performance of the season and, arriving back on the boat late at night, the fans had been furious. Now, a week having passed and league victory secured, Kirian approached them, the voice of the fans\u2019 leader on the microphone declaring \u201cquiet, the captain wants to say something\u201d as he came towards the stand. There was a hush, and he began. \u201cWe have a bloody brilliant bond; all of us together make a brilliant group,\u201d Kirian told them. \u201cAnd we all suffer. We go home pissed off too. Many of the insults these lads got they didn\u2019t deserve. It hurts them, it hurts, just like it hurts all of you. They cry too. We have to stay together. When someone puts four past us, they put four past us. We\u2019ll fall, we\u2019ll cry, we\u2019ll do what we have to do. But when we suffer, we will need you more than ever. Today was a day to get back up again.\u201d From the stands there was applause, reconciliation complete, and then they started to sing: How Could We Not Love You? Well, quite. When Kirian came on against Zaragoza in April, playing his first game of the season 38 weeks in, Las Palmas were losing 1-0. By the time he went off again, they had equalised. He started the next four games of the season which were also the last four games of the season and they didn\u2019t lose any of them, clinching automatic promotion on goal difference, returning to the first division six years later. \u201cWe went up and made lots of people happy but the biggest triumph was Kirian becoming a footballer again,\u201d the club\u2019s manager, Garc\u00eda Pimienta, said. And what a footballer. Kirian had never been there, and it took six weeks for Las Palmas to secure a first division victory. When at last they did, against Granada, he was the one who scored the winner \u2013 with a brilliant shot in the 90th minute. In that run at the end of last season, they had played Eibar, Cartagena, Alav\u00e9s, and Villarreal B; this Saturday he scored twice against Villarreal\u2019s first team, moving Las Palmas to three points off a European place. \u201cIt\u2019s been a hard week: the cup game hurt. But this group trains like the very best; it\u2019s an incredible group, a pleasure. It\u2019s very hard to find a dressing room like ours, with the unity we have. When the weekend comes you have to enjoy it. Hopefully we still haven\u2019t found our ceiling,\u201d Kirian said. \u201cFootball has put us where it puts us: on the crest of a wave,\u201d came the voice from the stands at the end of that exchange at full-time. With five goals, Kirian is Las Palmas\u2019s top scorer, but it is not that; it is everything, including the experiences that shape him and those around him. Kirian has studied psychology, and there is a moment for mindfulness before every game. He is the embodiment of everything they want to be, a tiny team with the second smallest salary limit in primera who have more of the ball than anyone except Madrid and Barcelona \u2013 not least because, he says, if they just booted it they would probably be down by January. Besides, he insists: in the Canaries you grow up with a ball at your feet; why would you ever want to change that? \u201cWhat can I say about him? He\u2019s a player for whom there\u2019s a special feeling,\u201d Garc\u00eda Pimienta says. \u201cThat\u2019s been there from the start. [But] this season he has taken a step forward in terms of leadership, he plays really well, he wants every ball; he never hides.\u201d He has been involved in more than three times as many plays than the rest of Las Palmas\u2019s midfielders, provided three times more passes and created twice as many chances. Across the whole of La Liga, only one player has completed more passes or had more touches \u2013 Girona\u2019s Aleix Garc\u00eda \u2013 only two players have completed more passes in the opposition\u2019s half, and only six have recovered possession more. \u201cHe had the problem last year and now look how he is playing: it\u2019s a sweet moment and he deserves it,\u201d Garc\u00eda Pimienta said. There genuinely may be no one better this season; there is certainly no one you would rather see play. As he made his way off on Saturday, the coach whose team he had taken apart was among those applauding him; more than any other, maybe that was the moment. \u201cI just wanted to express how happy I am to see him leave all that behind,\u201d the Villarreal manager, Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral, said. Is this the best moment of your career, Kirian was asked. \u201cYes, without doubt,\u201d he said. \u201cFor everything: for my family, my people, the group, the island. Everything\u2019s come together after what I lived last year. I\u2019m enjoying this to the maximum, because in the end life is a rollercoaster.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-15T17:45:00Z",
            "content": "Growing concern that heightened geopolitical tension could damage an already shaky global economy has dominated the start of the annual gathering of the world\u2019s business and political elite in Davos, Switzerland. Three potential flash points \u2013 Ukraine, the Middle East and Taiwan \u2013 threatened to overshadow the meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) aimed at rebuilding trust after the series of setbacks suffered in the past four years, including war, the Covid-19 pandemic and the cost of living crisis. Meanwhile, a study of global business leaders to mark the start of the gathering in the Swiss mountain resort showed UK chief executives embracing generative artificial intelligence more rapidly than their peers in other countries. France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, are all scheduled to address the WEF this week, as is Argentina\u2019s new president Javier Milei. With Middle East tensions rising, the US is sending its secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the its national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, to Davos. Israel\u2019s president, Isaac Herzog, is also attending, as are the prime ministers of Iraq, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, and Jordan, Bisher al-Khasawneh, and Iran\u2019s minister of foreign affairs, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian. The UK chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, and his Labour shadow, Rachel Reeves, are both speaking at this year\u2019s event. Hunt\u2019s predecessor, Kwasi Kwarteng, is also attending. Artificial intelligence will dominate Davos, with OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman due to appear on a panel. AI is seen by its proponents as a possible way of boosting growth, but the WEF said in last week\u2019s global risks report that it could be misused by hostile states and other malign forces. Interviewed by CNBC, Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that without measures to shape its use AI would lead to greater inequality. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s arriving \u2013 do not close your eyes or put your head in the sand. AI requires preparation.\u201d In its annual survey of chief executives, the accountancy firm PwC said almost half (42%) of those running UK companies had implemented the new technology in the past year, compared with 32% in other countries. The survey of 4,702 CEOs in 105 countries found the UK was one of the frontrunners in adopting the generative AI that runs chatbots such as ChatGPT and image generators such as Midjourney. Only 9% of German chief executives and 20% of French CEOs had adopted GenAI, along with 38% of US CEOs and 25% of China\u2019s CEOs. Only Norway, (53%), Japan (50%) and Finland (49%) had been faster. Kevin Ellis, a senior partner at PwC UK, said: \u201cAfter an uphill trek against economic headwinds, UK chief execs are seeking gamechanging opportunities. GenAI presents a \u2018move or lose\u2019 moment \u2013 implemented with care, it offers huge benefits for efficiency, competitiveness and ultimately profitability. \u201cThe UK\u2019s service-based economy makes it ideally placed for the GenAI revolution \u2013 building tech is only half the battle, ensuring people and businesses can use it is key.\u201d The PwC survey found UK chief executives upbeat about the prospects for the global economy, with 61% expecting it to improve this year \u2013 a threefold increase on the poll conducted in 2023. After almost two years in which the economy has moved sideways, UK business leaders were markedly less confident about the prospects for the UK than they were about the global economy. Only 39% expected it to improve in 2024, although PwC said this was up from 9% a year ago. At the Davos opening ceremony on Monday night, the WEF presented its annual crystal awards to architect and educator Di\u00e9b\u00e9do Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9, the Oscar-winning actor Michelle Yeoh, and the musician and producer Nile Rodgers. Yeoh, star of many hit films including Tomorrow Never Dies; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; and Everything Everywhere All At Once, was recognised for her work raising awareness and mobilising support for the United Nations\u2019 sustainable development goals, and for promoting sustainable fashion, disaster-preparedness and road safety. K\u00e9r\u00e9 received the award for \u201chis exemplary leadership\u201d helping Burkina Faso\u2019s Gando community create a socially, economically and ecologically sustainable future through projects that focus on education, health and the environment. The WEF also recognised Rodgers\u2019 humanitarian work, including fighting systemic racism, inequality and injustice, championing young people, and co-founding the We Are Family Foundation to promote cultural diversity after 9/11."

            "date": "2024-01-14T08:00:23Z",
            "content": "The year begins sadly. Franz Beckenbauer has died. He gave more to German football than anyone else and embodied his country in the best possible way. With wit, charisma, expertise, charm and optimism. The world bows before this shining light. Beckenbauer always instilled enormous confidence in Germans. First as a player, then as a coach and finally as the man behind the 2006 summer fairytale. It was always true: if Franz takes care of things, nothing can happen to us. I didn\u2019t experience Franz Beckenbauer as a player; the last time he was on the pitch was shortly before I was born. But I did experience the reverence with which my father spoke of him. And when I later looked at the old recordings from the 60s and 70s, some still in black and white, I immediately noticed something: everything was much slower than it is today. The players took a long time to position the ball. They only passed it with their second or third touch. Except for one. Franz played the ball directly to where he wanted it. He played in a way that became common decades later. Like a man from the future. I have a free-kick in my mind\u2019s eye that he, in a Bayern shirt, flicked over the wall and into the corner of the goal with the outside of his foot after a straight run-up. This goal must have seemed like a miracle to those who witnessed it. Beckenbauer embodied this progress, this technical innovation, with unprecedented ease. And he was not only more elegant than the others, he had a different idea of football and teamwork. He became a role model for a generation. Der Kaiser modernised football, accelerated it, made it more beautiful. I can\u2019t think of anyone who changed the game in the same way. When West Germany became world champions in 1990 under Beckenbauer, I was glued to the television as a six-year-old. I think I watched every game of that World Cup. I remember the penalty kick Andi Brehme scored to win the title. And the hairstyle of the team manager, who entertained the whole country with his jokes. You saw a world champion coach who worked so hard that his mother worried about him \u201cbecause Franz was so thin\u201d. He knew how to address his players. \u201cGeht\u2019s raus und spielt\u2019s Fu\u00dfball.\u201d: \u201cGo out on to the pitch and play football.\u201d He gave everyone courage, because one thing was always clear to everyone: nothing can go wrong with Franz. In 2006, when the World Cup kicked off in Germany, I was on the pitch. The goal I scored in the opening game against Costa Rica is one of the highlights of my career. Being able to play a World Cup in your home country is a priceless gift. The connection with the crowd, the closeness to the fans, has always filled me with confidence. The 2006 experience carried me through my career. It also made me realise my responsibility as a footballer. The World Cup transformed Germany. A nation that was used to looking at itself very critically suddenly recognised its beautiful teams. A free-playing Germany helped the country look itself in the mirror. Football helped Germany to recognise itself. We all know mistakes were made around the 2006 World Cup. But in the case of Beckenbauer, something got out of balance. His life\u2019s work for German football and his country cannot be overestimated. The Sommerm\u00e4rchen would not have been possible without the president of the organising committee. Another tournament is due to be held in Germany this summer. Times have changed, the world is plagued by many crises. We have to adapt, strengthen our community and learn to appreciate Europe and all its achievements again. To do this, we need a new impetus. Europe can do this, its people are capable of it. And football as a cultural asset is part of European civil society. The game can create solidarity and unite people across borders. The many warm-hearted obituaries Franz Beckenbauer has received from all countries shows this. Euro 2024 should strengthen our cohesion and the European idea. For sport to achieve this, it needs authentic personalities who radiate satisfaction, pride and optimism. Franz Beckenbauer always did that. That is his legacy. Philipp Lahm\u2019s column was produced in partnership with Oliver Fritsch at Zeit Online, the German online magazine."

            "content": "I am suffering serious plot envy. The cause: a five-acre organic garden in southern Kerala. Close by the ocean. The soil is rich and red, with a crumb like cake. Everywhere, an abundant variety of fruit and vegetables. Snake gourds, aubergine, turmeric, ginger, species of extravagant beans. There are multiple varieties of chilli. Plus, tomatoes and peppers, many trays of coriander. Coconut is abundant: crazily tall skinny trees, alarmingly cropped by men free-climbing on spiked metal shoes. Fruit is hacked off with machetes, branches crashing down. I take to wandering around most mornings. Often in envy, more often in near-open-mouthed admiration. I am joined by shrieking peacocks, a pair of playful mongooses. Paths are lined with clover. Also marigolds grown for companion planting and puja. At the bottom of the site is a huge, ancient water tank. Just beyond it, a rich neighbour\u2019s incongruous helipad. There are many beds of yams and red amaranth. Grown from single seedlings immaculately spaced for optimum growth. I feel I am being gently schooled. Banana plants are dotted through the site. Their fruit no larger than fat fingers. Papaya cascades in extravagant bunches. I am inspired by a recycling innovation. Decapitated 5-litre plastic water bottles used as plant pots. The tops put out as mini greenhouses covering germinating seed. Another revelation is bhindi: lady fingers. I only today discovered it is a Hibiscus esculentus. Beautiful tall, single-flowered mallow plants spiked with cornered fruit. A gardener breaks one off for us to eat raw. It\u2019s crisp, delicate, delicious. Later, we enjoy them in vegetable thoran. In a sambar with idli for breakfast. Both are simple perfection: inspirational plot to plate. But now please tell us: what gardening or gardeners inspire you?

            "date": "2024-01-30T10:00:25Z",
            "content": "When the austerity era began, the Tories were fond of telling their opponents that there was no such thing as a \u201cmagic money tree\u201d. But in September last year, George Osborne thought he\u2019d finally found one. You may have heard him talking about it. Political Currency, presented by Osborne and his former Labour opponent Ed Balls, was a cheerfully transparent attempt to take a piece of an exciting new trend in the political podcast market: the ravenous appetite of centrist commuting blokes of a certain age to listen to \u2013 be in the room with \u2013 two sensible remainer men who wish they were still in charge. Rory Stewart, whose own podcast with Alastair Campbell, The Rest Is Politics, is a fixture of the Top 5 in Apple\u2019s chart, calls it disagreeing agreeably. We can call it dadcasting. (You will not be too surprised that as a 40-year-old father who lives in Hackney and literally works for the Guardian, I enjoy several of them.) Billed as expert insight from political pros unshackled from the discipline of party politics, dadcasts \u2013 named for their most devoted listeners \u2013 are obviously useful as a reputation-laundering service. (You feel in your bones that Matt Hancock has been doggedly shopping around a concept.) They are also useful because they hold the promise of making you absolutely loads of money for quite a small amount of work. That\u2019s not because podcasts have become mass media: even the most successful shows still count their audiences in the hundreds of thousands. But the model for the recent raft of chatshows is simplicity itself: get two well-known faces in the studio, hit record and count the advertiser cash as it flows in. The goliaths among the independent production companies are Persephonica, which produces Political Currency and The News Agents for LBC, and Gary Lineker\u2019s Goalhanger, which produces The Rest Is \u2026 across a range of subjects. For their headline acts, they operate on a profit-sharing model. This significantly lowers the risk of being stuck with an expensive contractual commitment on a failing show, and offers a lot more upside to the talent. No production company shares audience figures publicly, but industry rivals estimate The Rest Is Politics gets north of 200,000 listeners an episode, with the main weekly edition supplemented by an audience-boosting Q&amp;A. The golden goose has also laid an additional interview podcast, Leading, which comes out every Monday. As a rule of thumb, programmatic ads start at about \u00a310 per thousand listeners; \u201chost reads\u201d, where presenters read the ads out themselves, can command up to five times that. All of this is supplemented by live shows and a \u00a33.50 monthly membership. With minimal production costs, that translates to a lot of profit. Last year, Stewart marvelled that \u201cI\u2019ve earned more this month than I\u2019ve ever earned doing anything else in my life\u201d, and called it \u201cChampionship footballer money\u201d. Estimates of \u00a370,000 a month each have not been disputed. The much less lively Osborne-Balls knockoff oscillates between the 30s and the 60s in the Apple charts, and industry insiders estimate its audience as somewhere between 60,000 and 75,000. It still seems likely to be earning its hosts a six-figure annual sum. (The best of luck to Lord Lebedev of Hampton and Siberia, whose passion project about \u201cfuturists set on forging new paths for humanity\u201d launched earlier this month and currently sits outside Apple\u2019s top 250.) Goalhanger\u2019s co-founder, Jack Davenport, recently called the model \u201cchat format, high volume, always on\u201d. Talking about Lineker\u2019s new football show with Alan Shearer and Micah Richards, he acknowledged the importance of money in the mix: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been possible for very long in podcasting, to be really honest, to afford those kind of people.\u201d There is undoubtedly huge skill in identifying the chemistry necessary to make these shows work. And the entrepreneurial spirit that sparked the dadcast revolution is not objectionable in itself. But there is something deadening about the way it reveals the podcast market to be going. Whether you call it commercial maturity or capitalism\u2019s bleakly inevitable assimilation of all cultural forms, the conclusion is the same. To see how this goes, consider the streaming giants, which started out as upstart disruptors to the traditional networks and took all kinds of risks on shows that would never get commissioned by terrestrial TV. These days, the golden age of television appears to be on its last legs: Netflix sells ads, makes much more conventional choices and is as mainstream as it gets. The podcast charts today abound with evidence of a similar tendency. The Diary of a CEO, Jake Humphrey\u2019s High Performance and Modern Wisdom are all chasing the same audience of men in search of cod philosophical self-optimisation. Peter Crouch took his popular format about being a matey footballer away from the BBC, so the BBC came up with My Mate\u2019s a Footballer. And many, many influencers have marriages that are relatably similar to your own. The proliferation is the problem. After a pandemic boom that saw more than a million new shows released in 2020, the saturation of the market brought that down to about 218,500 in 2023. But on average, about 2.4m episodes are still released globally each month. \u201cIt was all growth for everybody two or three years ago,\u201d one industry veteran says. \u201cNow to get on to someone\u2019s regular listening list you have to bump someone else off.\u201d In the face of all this, the makers of resource-intensive narrative shows or series based on eccentric personal obsessions may be lost in the cacophony. Shows that run in short seasons rather than wallpapering their listeners\u2019 phones all year round used to be able to rely on returning audiences, but now find that numbers dip dramatically if they go off air for any length of time. Even the studios behind these shows are being advised by platforms to find the viral always-on hit that can underwrite the rest of the stable. Shows outside the very highest echelons are, meanwhile, reeling from Apple\u2019s decision to switch off automatic downloads for users who haven\u2019t listened to five episodes of a show in a fortnight \u2013 news that will make advertising data more accurate, but mean a double-digit percentage haircut in audience figures. To succeed in this climate, or even to be noticed, a large social-media following is all but essential. It may help to be part of an ecosystem such as Goalhanger\u2019s: when the studio bought the interview show Walking The Dog from the Times, the first guest was Alastair Campbell. Looking at the Top 100 shows on Apple and Spotify, it also seems to help enormously to be white. The dadcasts aren\u2019t the entirety of this bleak phenomenon. But they are its inescapable emblem. And they are in danger of building a world where podcasts are exactly like everything else: chat format. High volume. Always on.

            "title": "Immersive exhibitions based on artists such as Van Gogh and Dali derided as \u2018money grab\u2019",
            "date": "2024-01-24T06:00:05Z",
            "content": "From animated floor-to-ceiling paintings to giant fluorescent ball pits, immersive art experiences have proliferated in warehouses, often costing \u00a325-\u00a340 a head. Now experts have claimed that many are overpriced gimmicks. Leading digital artists have claimed that some of the most popular commercial immersive experiences, particularly those based on the work of deceased artists, such as Van Gogh and Dal\u00ed, are a money grab that provide little reward to visitors beyond Instagrammable moments. The proliferation of these shows, which often use relatively old technology, is diluting public perception of what immersive experiences could be and risks sidelining more innovative work, the artists have claimed. Lucy Hardcastle, a designer and digital artist who runs her own studio in London, said the commercialisation of immersive experiences did not leave room for many original ideas. Hardcastle, who has made work for the Victoria and Albert Museum and Chanel, drew a distinction between commercial experiences like the Van Gogh, Monet and Dal\u00ed exhibitions, which are primarily screen- or projection-based, and more cutting-edge shows where artists have created physical and digital environments from scratch. For example, the work of studio DRIFT, which is led by Dutch artists, includes creating an autonomously moving group of illuminated drones, programmed to fly using an algorithm derived from years of research into starling murmurations. The post-digital art group Random International created Rain Room \u2013 where visitors entered a downpour without getting wet \u2013 which attracted tens of thousands of visitors to the Barbican and the New York Museum of Modern Art. These kinds of projects often take years to develop. In contrast, some of the most popular commercial experiences that opened since these pioneering shows primarily used projection mapping \u2013 where displays are projected on to real-world objects or spaces to simulate environments or augment reality \u2013 which they had not created and dated back to the 1990s. \u201cI think things like the Van Gogh experience, and that price point, definitely warps the perception of the craftsmanship that goes into these types of events,\u201d said Hardcastle, who also teaches at Chelsea School of Art. Hardcastle said she thought the word immersive had become \u201ca gimmicky tagline\u201d. Whereas it was once associated with shows that engaged all the senses, it was often now more about creating something that looks good on Instagram. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like our expectations or standards have just continued to become lowered [by these experiences]. And therefore there\u2019s less demand to make something that\u2019s truly outstanding.\u201d Ralph Nauta, the co-founder of studio DRIFT, also said it was comparatively easy for commercial ventures to make a projected animation of a dead artist\u2019s work. But their own projects, such as Drifter, which involved a floating concrete block, took years of original research. \u2018To physically \u2013 and with the laws of nature \u2013 have a block of concrete fly, that\u2019s 15 years of work for that one piece,\u201d he said. Nauta described popular screen-based immersive experiences as \u201ca money grab\u201d, arguing they did not provide the audience with contemplation or value. \u201cThe visitor walks out and feels, oh, I\u2019m $50 lighter, but I\u2019ve not experienced anything, I\u2019ve just been put in front of a screen.\u201d He also questioned whether the dead artists whose work has been turned into immersive experiences would approve of how their work was being displayed. \u201cIt\u2019s like, oh, we do a Van Gogh show, we do a Dal\u00ed show. Nobody knows if he wanted this. I think it\u2019s very disrespectful.\u201d \u201cIt gives the whole industry a bad name and it can be so, so, so much more.\u201d The artists said the industry needed organisations like the Serpentine and arebyte galleries in London, which has supported emerging artists who work with immersive technology. Claudel Goy, the managing director of arebyte, said the expansion of commercial shows like the Van Gogh experience had attracted new audiences to immersive art and raised its public profile. But she said there was a need for public institutions to support more cutting-edge work. Goy said the prices of commercial immersive experiences reflected the high overheads of the technology and the cost of spaces in prime locations of cities like London. Arebyte hopes to open an immersive art museum in east London, with ticketed exhibitions costing up to \u00a315. She said: \u201cWe\u2019re definitely not going to charge \u00a325. Who can afford it? As a family of four, [that\u2019s] \u00a3100 \u2013 that\u2019s not accessible at all.\u201d Hannes Koch, a co-founder of the German Random International said artist-led immersive displays could not compete with their more commercial peers because it was far more complicated to create something bespoke than simply use big screens. He said the ideal price point for immersive experiences was between \u00a38 and \u00a315. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s criminal to charge for something that is of high quality. But I think it\u2019s good to keep accessibility high on the radar.\u201d Sana Ali Aamir, the UK\u2019s general manager for Fever, the company behind Van Gogh: The Immersive Experience, defended the pricing of its most popular exhibitions, which she said helped fund the development of their other newer and more innovative shows, such as such as Dopamine Land and Bubble Planet, which cost about \u00a315-20. She said that the while the technology involved in the Van Gogh experience was now old, the storytelling in the experience, which takes visitors inside some of his most famous paintings via two-storey, 360-degree digital projections, was still powerful and value for money. It was arguably a richer way to experience his work because audiences learned more about the artist, she added. She added: \u201cThe value has been taking that innovation and making it into something that\u2019s more accessible. There\u2019s something for everybody in this market. You can use those expensive things to then drive the more affordable things, which is about giving access to more people and culture.\u201d"

The actors have been shortlisted alongside Mia McKenna-Bruce from How to Have Sex and Sophie Wilde from Talk to Me. All five have captured the imagination of both the public and film industry over the past year, Bafta said. Elordi \u2013 one of the biggest stars of Gen Z, who rose to prominence with his role in HBO\u2019s Euphoria \u2013 can be seen in two awards season contenders currently streaming and in cinemas. He stars as Felix in Emerald Fennell\u2019s hit psychological comedy-thriller Saltburn, and as Elvis Presley in Sofia Coppola\u2019s Priscilla. His forthcoming projects include The Narrow Road to the Deep North, an Australian limited series set during the second world war based on Richard Flanagan\u2019s Booker prize-winning novel, as well as Oh Canada in which he stars alongside Uma Thurman and Richard Gere. Dyenvor is most recognisable for her role as Daphne in Shonda Rhimes\u2019 global phenomenon Bridgerton. Most recently, she starred in Chloe Domont\u2019s finance thriller Fair Play, about a couple whose relationship starts to unravel after an unexpected promotion at a cutthroat hedge fund firm. She is also set to star opposite Diane Lane and Zoey Deutch in the forthcoming thriller Anniversary. Comedian, writer, producer and actor Edebiri won a Golden Globe this week for her role as Sydney in the breakout TV show The Bear, and is also nominated for an Emmy. She most recently starred in Bottoms, a satirical comedy which follows the story of two high-school senior girls who set up a fight club as a vehicle to hook up with cheerleaders. McKenna-Bruce received acclaim for her lead performance in Molly Manning Walker\u2019s How to Have Sex, about three British teenage girls on a trip to Malia. She also starred as Mary Musgrove, the younger sister of Dakota Johnson\u2019s Anne Elliot, in the film adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s Persuasion. Wilde most recently appeared as the lead in Talk to Me, which critics called one of the scariest horror movies of recent years. The project quickly became one of A24\u2019s highest grossing films of 2023. Wilde will next appear in Baby Girl, alongside Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson. The nominees were announced during a press conference at the Savoy Hotel in London by actor and producer Stephen Graham and film critic and radio host Ali Plumb. They were selected by a panel of industry jurors including actors Daisy Edgar-Jones, \u1e62\u1ecdp\u1eb9\u0301 D\u00ecr\u00eds\u00f9 and Himesh Patel. Jane Millichip, CEO at Bafta, said: \u201cThese remarkable individuals represent what Bafta and the EE Rising Star award stand for as the future of the film industry, embodying innovation, dedication and a commitment to storytelling that captivates audiences worldwide.\u201d The EE Rising Star is the only award voted for by the British public. Voting is now open at ee.co.uk/BAFTA until midday 16 February, with the winner announced at the awards ceremony on 18 February. Previous winners include James McAvoy, Tom Hardy, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Lashana Lynch, John Boyega and Tom Holland."

            "content": "The climate activist Greta Thunberg has marched alongside local residents and Extinction Rebellion activists to protest against an airport\u2019s expansion plans. Farnborough Airport Ltd has submitted a planning application to Rushmoor borough council to increase the number of flights from 50,000 to 70,000 a year. The Swedish climate activist joined the march from Farnborough town centre, in Hampshire, to Farnborough airport. The group set off pink smoke flares and waved banners as they called for a total ban on private jets, which they say are up to 30 times more polluting than passenger airliners. \u201cThe fact that using private jets is both legally and socially allowed today in an escalating climate emergency is completely detached from reality,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cThere are few examples that show as clearly how the rich elite is sacrificing present and future living conditions on this planet so they can maintain their extreme and violent lifestyles.\u201d If approved, the airport plans would result in an increase in non-weekday aircraft movements from 8,900 to 18,900 a year and would allow heavier aircraft to use the airport. Farnborough airport said its environmental footprint was \u201ca fraction that of a traditional commercial airport\u201d yet it served as one of the largest employment sites in the region. Rushmoor borough council will consider the plans in March. Todd Smith, a former airline pilot and an Extinction Rebellion spokesperson, said: \u201cFlying is the fastest way to fry the planet and private jets are the most polluting way to fly. \u201cSurely it\u2019s a no-brainer to ban private jets and stop expanding these luxury airports in the midst of a climate crisis? Survey after survey, as well as several citizens\u2019 assemblies, have shown this would be very popular and has widespread support from the general public.\u201d Sarah Hart, an office assistant from Farnborough, said: \u201cAs a local resident and a mum of two, I am utterly appalled at the airport\u2019s plan to expand when we should be banning private flying completely. We need to be taking drastic steps to ensure a liveable world for all our children, not increasing our use in fossil fuels.\u201d A Farnborough airport spokesperson said the facility was an \u201cimportant gateway for business aviation connectivity with the majority of flights being operated for business and corporate travel purposes\u201d. He said: \u201cThe airport\u2019s environmental footprint is a fraction that of a traditional commercial airport, yet it serves as one of the largest employment sites in the region. We recognise the importance of continually reducing our environmental impact and we are only one of a small number of UK airports to have achieved level four-plus under the airport carbon accreditation programme.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-07T12:49:51Z",
            "content": "The owner of the Masters snooker tournament is plotting an expansion trail across Asia after the pandemic exposed the company\u2019s reliance on China, its chair has revealed. Steve Dawson, the chief executive of World Snooker Ltd, told the Guardian it was considering staging tournaments in India, Pakistan, Malaysia and Thailand, after its business was held back by three years of Beijing-imposed Covid lockdowns. He also hopes young players in the sport can take inspiration from 16-year-old Luke Littler\u2019s astonishing run to the PDC World Darts Championship final, which is also run by World Snooker\u2019s owner Matchroom. The sports promotion firm was founded by veteran Barry Hearn and is now led by his son, Eddie, and spans boxing, darts, snooker, basketball and gymnastics. Dawson said the run of Chinese lockdowns, where the company hosts snooker world tour events, \u201cwas a real eye opener for us that we need to look at spreading our risk a bit\u201d and \u201chave a broader spread of international events across Asia and Europe, with less reliance on any single territory\u201d. Dawson said World Snooker, which also runs tournaments in Turkey and Germany, plans \u201ccautious expansion\u201d into new markets. The company hosts the UK Championship and the World Snooker Championship, as well as the Masters, which is staged at Alexandra Palace in London and begins on Sunday. More than 30,000 tickets have been sold for the event, far outstripping the 7,000 sold in 2011, when it was staged at Wembley before moving to north London. Dawson said Littler could offer inspiration to a clutch of young players, including the British teenager Stan Moody. \u201cAll we need to do is give them opportunities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got three or four very good [young] players. But snooker is slightly more difficult \u2013 it\u2019s more of an elitist platform, you can\u2019t just go to the local pub to play snooker because there aren\u2019t enough tables around and it takes a long time to be very good.\u201d The audience for the darts final peaked at 3.7 million, while the World Snooker Championship final viewing reached a high of 4.5 million last year. \u201cWe need to work like crazy to have a conveyor belt of new, quality players coming through as there\u2019s a difference between people playing the sport and watching it.\u201d Asked whether snooker needed to bring in a younger audience, Dawson said: \u201cThe image has to modernise but everyone is always very critical about the age of audiences. If we know that our audience is [aged] 50, 55 plus \u2013 that\u2019s an audience that\u2019s got money and economic power, and we\u2019d be happy to work to deliver an audience.\u201d In its last published accounts for the year to 30 June 2022, World Snooker posted operating profits of \u00a32m, with revenues of \u00a326.6m \u2013 then a record, despite the Chinese lockdowns. Dawson revealed that turnover had reached a new high-water mark, at \u00a329.1m, but operating profits dipped to \u00a31.7m in the following financial year. The company paid out a \u00a31.5m dividend, which the Hearn family shared in. More than \u00a3300,000 was spent on a new website, app and a rebrand. World Snooker has set a target of distributing prize money of \u00a320m in the 2025-26 financial year, up from an expected \u00a314m this year. Dawson said directors at Matchroom were \u201cstill considering our options\u201d after talks with private equity firm CVC to take a minority stake fell through last year."

            "date": "2024-01-03T06:00:13Z",
            "content": "For four years, Colin Shearn, a 62-year-old retired corporate executive, led the Farnborough Noise Group, a watchdog for locals worried about the operations of Farnborough airport, the UK\u2019s busiest private jet airfield. Then, one day in August, police came knocking at his door. Shearn, they claimed in a 92-page document, had conducted an \u201caggressive and relentless campaign against Farnborough airport\u201d. He was accused of \u201cbombarding\u201d the airport and relevant authorities \u201cwith endless questions about air traffic\u201d, while \u201cadopting a belligerent and aggressive style, distorting or misrepresenting a point of view to suit his agenda\u201d. With just seven days to prepare for a court hearing, he was unable to persuade a judge to deny Surrey police\u2019s application for an antisocial behaviour injunction (asbi) \u2013 the successor to the much-derided asbo. He was ordered to stop \u201ccausing any harassment, alarm or distress, nuisance or annoyance to any person\u201d in Surrey or Hampshire, or face jail or a fine, or both. Three weeks later \u2013 just as Shearn, its chief critic, was silenced \u2013 Farnborough announced that it planned to double weekend flights. Farnborough is the UK\u2019s oldest aerodrome, and was the site of Britain\u2019s first-ever powered flight. But for most of its 120-year history, it operated as a military and civil aviation research centre. Experimental jets ripped through the skies over Hampshire \u2013 but during daylight hours only, and not at all at weekends. Then, 30 years ago, after the military deemed it surplus to requirements, the government agreed to Farnborough\u2019s redevelopment for business aviation. Initially it began operations in 2000 with 28,000 flights a year, 2,500 of those at weekends and on bank holidays. In 2011, the government overruled the local councillors to increase the number of flights to 50,000 a year with 8,900 at weekends, but maintained weight limits that restricted heavier aircraft from using Farnborough. Its latest planning application, submitted to Rushmoor borough council last week, gives the airport a ceiling of 70,000 flights a year, including 19,000 at weekends, and allows for heavier aircraft to use the airport. Farnborough airport says the changes are necessary to meet increased demand for business trips. It claims its proposals will support 4,100 jobs and add \u00a3470m to the UK economy by 2040. And it insists its emissions are forecast to meet the UK\u2019s net zero targets. Many of the airport\u2019s neighbours are sceptical. In October, at a community consultation event in Fleet, a Hampshire commuter town 45 minutes from London, Paul Whelan, from nearby Farnham, said his main concerns were about noise and pollution from the increased air traffic. \u201cI think some of these plans just sound like a bit much,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have noticed a big increase in numbers [of flights]. We\u2019ve lived in our house for the last 40 years. It really makes you look up.\u201d There are wider concerns. Just this summer, the government\u2019s Climate Change Committee, which advises ministers on net zero goals, reiterated there should be no airport expansion until the aviation industry started to cut its CO2 emissions. Flying made up 7% of the UK\u2019s total carbon emissions last year. And Farnborough\u2019s critics say its emissions profile is particularly egregious. Jules Crossley, a Rushmoor borough councillor, said: \u201cThe whole point of Farnborough\u2019s expansion is to increase the cap on weekend flights.\u201d She claimed that although the airport sold itself as a centre for business aviation, many of its flights were for leisure purposes, and were taken by a small number of wealthy people. Her claim seems to be supported by research. A recent study by the campaign group Possible found that half of Farnborough flights in the busiest summer months headed to the Mediterranean, rather than business locations, while a quarter of winter flights headed for Alpine destinations. In September a service launched specifically to shuttle dogs and their owners to Dubai and back. \u201cBusiness aviation today, that just means private,\u201d Crossley said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the convenience of the customer profile, it\u2019s not that every flight is for business reasons \u2026 It\u2019s about facilitating the richest people to have a journey with the most convenience possible.\u201d It is an industry enjoying massive growth. One in 10 departures from UK airports are now private jet flights, according to Possible. Planes using Farnborough airport carry an average of only 2.5 passengers per plane and 40% of aircraft fly empty. This means that, per passenger mile, those passengers are 20\u201340 times more polluting than a passenger doing the same journey on a commercial flight. A Farnborough airport spokesperson said flight numbers had increased over two decades due to market growth and displacement from other London airports, and insisted it was \u201cat the forefront of sustainability\u201d as \u201cone of only three UK airports to be certified as level 4+ carbon neutral for those emissions in its direct control\u201d. The spokesperson conceded that many flights were for leisure, with increases to holiday destinations during the summer and winter holiday seasons, but insisted 80% in total were \u201ceither directly or indirectly related\u201d to business matters. \u201cWhilst Farnborough airport\u2019s emissions per passenger are approximately 10 times greater than those of a commercial airport, its economic output per passenger is substantially higher,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThis is consistent with the high proportion of business and corporate flights that use the airport.\u201d Shearn\u2019s asbi has stopped him engaging directly with Farnborough airport and has forced him to step down as the chair of Farnborough Noise Group. \u201cI can\u2019t challenge the Civil Aviation Authority any more,\u201d Shearn said. \u201cI can\u2019t write to the CAA. I can\u2019t write to the airport or the Farnborough Aerodrome Consultative Committee any more \u2026 It just limits everything I do. I can\u2019t challenge anything, in case I upset or annoy anyone.\u201d His silencing has turned into a local scandal. Local newspapers have published reports on it, and a former police and crime commissioner for Surrey has written in support of him. Crossley, who also sits on the Farnborough Aerodrome Consultative Committee (FACC), told the Guardian she saw no reason for Shearn\u2019s explicit ban from contacting the group. \u201cI was speaking to a longstanding member of the FACC \u2026 and he and I were agreeing that the other members of the FACC haven\u2019t ever been consulted about this at all, and haven\u2019t even been notified,\u201d Crossley said. \u201cNone of us see Colin as a nuisance. Everybody\u2019s tempers can flare but I have never seen him lose his temper \u2026 He informs people. Sometimes there is disagreement about the information, because it is like a lot of science, some of it is not fixed. \u201cOn the whole he\u2019s very knowledgable and I think that frightens people.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 3 January 2024 to make clear that it was Surrey police, not Hampshire, that applied for Colin Shearn\u2019s asbi."

            "date": "2024-01-31T05:00:05Z",
            "content": "Myanmar has undertaken a vast and secretive prison-building programme, according to new satellite analysis, prompting fears it has been carried out to jail thousands of pro-democracy protesters. Analysis of the images taken before the February 2021 military coup \u2013 which ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi \u2013 through to January 2024, indicate that 27 of 59 prisons identified in the south-east Asian country showed signs of large-scale expansion or the construction of new wings or buildings. Officially undeclared by the ruling military, the extensive prison building programme has prompted fresh disquiet that Myanmar\u2019s jail network is an increasingly central part of the ongoing crackdown against the nation\u2019s pro-democracy movement. More than 25,900 \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d have been arrested since the 2021 coup with almost 20,000 still detained, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners \u2013 which keeps a toll of those killed, jailed or detained by the military. Published to mark the third anniversary of the 1 February military coup, the analysis, carried out by Myanmar Witness, which collates and verifies evidence of human rights abuse, also detected that 33 new structures likely to house inmates have since been erected outside the perimeter of 25 prisons. \u201cDue to the security surrounding these additions, and factors such as location and their high-security structure, we believe they are new detention facilities connected to the official prisons,\u201d said Matt Lawrence, director of Myanmar Witness, which is run by the London-based Centre for Information Resilience, a research body partly funded by the British government. The study also identified an apparent proliferation of 53 labour camps, mainly quarry sites and agriculture projects in rural areas, of which almost all exhibited signs of continuous activity. The post-coup expansion of the prison system has coincided with the mass arrests of political opponents, journalists and activists. The most high-profile is Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar\u2019s de facto civilian leader who was arrested in a pre-dawn raid at the start of the coup, prompting fears she might be taken to Insein prison in Yangon City where she was held in 2003 and 2009. Probably the country\u2019s most notorious jail, Insein\u2019s distinctive radial design was constructed by British colonisers in 1887. In July 2022, Insein drew international headlines when four democracy activists were executed inside the prison, the first use of capital punishment in the country for decades. Accused of committing \u201cterror acts\u201d in a closed-door trial that human rights groups labelled unjust, the analysis appears to pinpoint the location of the gallows used during the infamous executions. Using open source images, Myanmar Witness says a small roofless structure visible in March 2022, and situated just inside the prison\u2019s original perimeter wall, was possibly the site of the killings, as subsequent images show it was later upgraded and fitted with a new blue roof. Activists believe this may have been to obscure the gallows from surveillance. Suu Kyi, however, has so far avoided being held within Insein. Instead, Myanmar\u2019s civilian leader was taken to the modern Naypyidaw prison, constructed just outside the newly built military capital of Naypyidaw. Again, Naypyidaw prison appears to have received significant investment during the last three years with large new buildings appearing inside and outside its perimeter. A year into the coup, in February 2022, several new buildings appear at the site. Later, in images dated April 2023, further additions materialise just north of the prison\u2019s gatehouse. Some prisoners, including Suu Kyi, were kept in solitary confinement while inside Naypyidaw, though reports suggest the 78-year-old was moved to house arrest in July 2023. The analysis also identifies two entirely new prisons built since the coup. One of these, geolocated in Mawlamyine township, Mon state, has been the subject of local reports indicating it will hold political prisoners and be solely run by the Myanmar military, rather than its prisons department. Since February 2022, satellite imagery has captured building works at the site. Although the analysis mapped more than 100 jails and labour camps in total, Lawrence said it was likely that the true expansion of Myanmar\u2019s prison estate was far more extensive than they had managed to establish. He said: \u201cOur methodology may well underestimate the expansion of prisoner accommodation. Open source data does not allow us to see inside every new building nor ascertain what every block is used for.\u201d Contemporary accounts detailing conditions have described hunger strikes, prisoner beatings and sexual violence alongside claims of overcrowding due to the high number of political prisoners detained. At the start of the year in what has become an annual ritual, Myanmar\u2019s military government ordered the mass pardon of thousands of inmates, including 114 foreigners. However, there is no sign that Suu Kyi \u2013 who has been seen once since her arrest, inside a spartan Naypyidaw courtroom \u2013 will be freed."

            "date": "2024-01-22T17:35:40Z",
            "content": "The mayor of London\u2019s office has taken charge of the decision on whether to approve the All England Lawn Tennis Club\u2019s controversial plans to build on a Grade II*-listed park to expand the Wimbledon grand slam championships. \u201cThis is a major planning application, of London-wide significance,\u201d a spokesperson for city hall said on Monday. \u201cTherefore, the deputy mayor has issued a direction under article 7 of the Town and Country Planning (Mayor of London) Order that he becomes the local planning authority for the purposes of determining the application. A full planning hearing will be held in due course.\u201d The AELTC, which has been running the championships since 1877, has applied for permission to build an 8,000-seat, 10-storey show court and 38 other grass courts on Wimbledon Park, but campaigners have condemned the as an \u201cindustrial tennis complex\u201d. The proposals to almost triple the size of the tennis championship grounds from 17 hectares (42 acres) to 46 hectares had been approved by Merton council but rejected by neighbouring Wandsworth council. Wimbledon Park, which was landscaped by Capability Brown in the 18th century and is specially protected as \u201cmetropolitan open land\u201d, stretches into both boroughs so in order for the plans to go ahead it needed to be approved by both councils. Merton referred the decision to the Greater London Authority (GLA). The decision officially lies with the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, but he recused himself because he publicly expressed support for the expansion in 2021. The deputy mayor of London, Jules Pipe, made the decision to take control of the application at the mayor\u2019s planning meeting on Monday. More than 16,000 people have signed a petition to \u201csave Wimbledon Park\u201d and 2,000 letters of objection have been received by the councils. The local Conservative MP, Stephen Hammond, and the Labour MP Fleur Anderson have also joined forces to oppose the AELTC\u2019s plans. Anderson, the MP for Putney, Roehampton and Southfields and Wandsworth Town, said: \u201cI have been campaigning against these proposals, alongside residents, for three years. The plans as they currently stand are bad for public access to green space, Londoners\u2019 lungs and our environment. \u201cThe GLA is a world-leading local authority when it comes to putting Londoners\u2019 health and our environment first. I hope that they will tell Wimbledon Tennis they need to go back to the drawing board.\u201d Deborah Jevans, the chair of the AELTC, welcomed city hall\u2019s decision to review the application. \u201cOur proposals will deliver one of the greatest sporting transformations for London since the 2012 Olympics,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will bring the qualifying event on site, in line with the other grand slams, and will ensure that Wimbledon remains one of the world\u2019s best sporting events.\u201d Jevans said the club\u2019s plans would \u201cunlock year-round community benefits including a new 23-acre park created on land which has been inaccessible to the public for over 100 years\u201d. \u201cProtecting the future of the championships, as well as significantly increasing publicly accessible green space, is a win-win for Londoners and will demonstrate beyond doubt that London is the sporting capital of the world.\u201d Iain Simpson, the chair of the Save Wimbledon Park (SWP) campaign group, also welcomed the announcement. He said: \u201cIt is notable that all political parties have declared their opposition to the AELTC\u2019s plans. SWP have been fighting this application since it was made three years ago. We have been urging the AELTC to speak to us, their local communities: it is time for them to think again.\u201d Almost 300 trees would be removed to allow the AELTC\u2019s building plans, which some locals described as \u201ccorporate ecocide\u201d. The club said most of the trees were \u201cpoor quality\u201d and promised to plant 1,500 new ones. The AELTC first set its sights on expanding into Wimbledon Park in 1993 when it bought the freehold of the land from Merton council for \u00a35.2m. But it signed a covenant agreeing that it would \u201cnot use the [land] other than for leisure or recreational purposes or as an open space\u201d. The club rented the land to Wimbledon Park golf club until 2018 when its chair said he feared the SW19 championships would fall behind its competitors in New York, Paris and Melbourne if it did not expand and offer greater facilities for players and spectators. The obvious place to expand, he said, was on to the golf club. However, the golf club\u2019s lease on the land lasted until 2041, so the AELTC could not take back the land for another 23 years. The tennis club offered the golf club members \u00a365m to give up their club early. That worked out as an \u00a385,000 windfall for every member, including Piers Morgan, Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, and Gus O\u2019Donnell, the former cabinet secretary."

            "content": "It wasn\u2019t a pretty win, but that matters little. Emma Hayes was frank enough to describe it as \u201cboring\u201d, but a Guro Reiten penalty and fumbled own goal from Myl\u00e8ne Chavas, the visiting keeper, gave Chelsea a 2-1 win against Real Madrid and confirmed progress to the Champions League quarter-finals at the top of Group D. Hayes\u2019s team were dominant but they struggled to make it count, forced to wait until the clock had ticked past the hour before taking the lead. Athenea del Castillo\u2019s equaliser heightened tensions relieved just six minutes earlier, but Erin Cuthbert\u2019s shot was almost thrown into the net by Chavas a minute later. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was a scintillating performance, but not every game is swashbuckling,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cReally good response to go 2-1 and then manage the game somewhat to the end in what was an efficient performance ... it was boring.\u201d Hayes made two changes to the team that won 3-1 against Manchester United on Sunday, with Jess Carter replacing the ineligible Nathalie Bj\u00f6rn, who joined this month from Everton, and Fran Kirby taking over from the hat-trick hero Lauren James. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to change much because you want to build the rhythm,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cNow, the priority has to be experimenting and giving opportunities. It\u2019s making sure we get Millie Bright back, Nathalie Bj\u00f6rn registered and [Catarina] Macario ready.\u201d Alluding to reports the Levante forward Mayra Ram\u00edrez is on her way to Chelsea, she added playfully: \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a new player coming \u2026 who knows!\u201d Asked about Bright\u2019s return, Hayes said: \u201cShe\u2019s not on the grass. When she gets on the grass, knowing Millie, she\u2019ll say it will be a day. When will she be on the grass? Before or after the international break? In that period.\u201d Alberto Toril shuffled his Madrid starting XI with seven changes to the side that lost 4-0 against Barcelona in the Supercopa semi-finals, before the Catalan club beat Levante 7-0 in the final. Before the visit of Real, Hayes warned that there was \u201cnothing more dangerous than playing a team that have nothing to play for\u201d, with the Spanish side unable to progress and on a single point before the game. Hayes was right to urge caution, despite Chelsea\u2019s dominant position in the group and the draw between H\u00e4cken and Paris FC meaning a win would secure top spot in Group D. Real weathered the early storm well. The visiting team could have had a penalty, though, when Kadeisha Buchanan and Carter both challenged the Colombian teenager Linda Caicedo, though the latter\u2019s follow\u2011through was heavy. Without VAR until the knockout stage of the competition, there was no chance for a second look. Toril expressed his concern in the Real technical area. He looked as surprised as anyone when, after hobbling around the edge of the pitch flanked by medical staff, Caicedo re-entered play. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Toril said. \u201cI was too far away, the referee was nearer.\u201d James, Chelsea\u2019s top scorer at Stamford Bridge this season, joined proceedings at half-time, making clear the desire for a win before the final group game against Paris FC. Caicedo exited at half-time for Del Castillo; with the Spanish side out there was no need to take any risks with the forward. \u201cIt was a small injury,\u201d Toril said. Back on the front foot after the break, with Kirby sitting ahead of James, Chelsea went close in the 55th minute, a looping header from Kirby with her back to goal almost catching out Chavas but bouncing wide. Chelsea\u2019s luck changed just past the hour, though, when a late tackle on Niamh Charles by Hayley Raso resulted in a deserved penalty. Reiten stepped up and fired into the bottom corner. The goal brought Stamford Bridge to life, the relief at the breakthrough palpable, but it was short\u2011lived. Six minutes separated the penalty and the response, Raso latching on to a ball over the top and powering it goalward. Hannah Hampton, on her Champions League debut, made a strong save, but Del Castillo was there to poke in the rebound. One minute later Chelsea were ahead once more. Cuthbert tested Chavas, who fumbled the ball into her own net. It was a calamitous way to concede, and Real will return to Spain after seven days to forget. For Chelsea, this was patient efficiency typical of a Hayes team \u2013 this time demonstrated by the newer generation of Chelsea players she is preparing for her successor. As Hayes readies to leave for the US women\u2019s national team job, there is something exciting in her selections and rotations \u2013 and something to watch."

            "content": "Shaun Maloney had wanted to know whether the team he supported as a boy could outfight and outplay the side he coaches in adulthood. The answer was a resounding yes, unfortunately for the Wigan Athletic manager, as Manchester United avoided a third round upset and further torment for Erik ten Hag with a professional job at the DW Stadium. A fine finish from Diogo Dalot and the softest of penalties for Bruno Fernandes secured United a fourth round trip to either League Two Newport County or Eastleigh of the National League. The visitors dominated Wigan, who were hoping for another FA Cup scalp in front of their biggest home attendance for a decade but only seriously threatened one from their first attack. The gulf between the Premier League and League One told, though Wigan were spared greater punishment by United\u2019s profligacy in front of goal. \u201cWe should have scored more but the good thing is we created the chances,\u201d said Ten Hag, who went as strong as possible with his starting lineup despite missing eight players through injury and illness. \u201cIt is a massive competition and everyone wants to win the FA Cup. We take it seriously.\u201d United must, as it is their only chance to lift another arduous season with silverware. Ineos executives Dave Brailsford and Jean-Claude Blanc took a front row seat in the directors\u2019 box, alongside former United CEO David Gill, as they continue their review into the inner workings of Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s latest investment. It was an uncomfortable opening for the visitors as Wigan almost scored from their first attack. Martial Godo led a counter-attack and picked out the unmarked Thelo Aasgaard with a low cross to the back post. It needed a fine save from Andr\u00e9 Onana to prevent the Liverpool-born, Norway under-21 international converting with a first time shot. Wigan were not to know it, but their best opportunity had been and gone. Maloney admitted: \u201cIt might have changed the dynamic of the game at that time but United had a lot of chances. It was a big chance but I can\u2019t criticise the effort of the team. It was difficult at times but I hope our players take a lot from it.\u201d Wigan were confident and positive in possession with Fulham loanee Godo prominent, but United\u2019s superior technique and movement gradually told. The visitors should have been out of sight by the interval but a combination of poor finishing, good goalkeeping and misfortune limited Ten Hag\u2019s side to a slender one-goal advantage. United took the lead through an excellent finish from Dalot. Marcus Rashford teed up the left-back after his initial shot had been blocked by defender Liam Morrison. There was a packed penalty area between Dalot and goal but he curled a precise shot beyond the Wigan goalkeeper Sam Tickle into the bottom corner. Rashford was involved in most of United\u2019s best moments yet, by the same token, was also wasteful considering the amount of possession he received. He brought the first save from Tickle with a low shot that the keeper reacted to sharply and almost doubled the visitors\u2019 lead when Tickle fumbled the striker\u2019s shot against a post. To Wigan\u2019s relief, the keeper was just able to retrieve the ball before it crossed the line. Tickle denied Rasmus H\u00f8jlund with his legs and was reprieved again when parrying a swerving Rashford shot straight into the path of the Denmark forward. The ball hit H\u00f8jlund and trickled wide of Tickle\u2019s goal. Alejandro Garnacho struck the crossbar from distance and Scott McTominay missed yet another clear opening when launching himself at a Fernandes cross only to head wide from close range. United continued to dominate possession after the break but were almost punished for the basic error of falling asleep at a Wigan throw-in. Aasgaard strolled away from Jonny Evans to the byline and centred for Godo, perfectly placed on the penalty spot and also left unmarked by the United defence. The winger miscued his volley badly off target. The impressive Kobbie Mainoo forced Tickle into a low save and made a vital interception to halt Godo\u2019s surge into the United area when Wigan staged a rare break. The irritation of the away fans at Rashford\u2019s casual approach was notable while the tie somehow remained in the balance. The England international produced a telling response, however, with a key contribution to United\u2019s second goal. Rashford burst past Sean Clare to the byline where, having previously ran the ball out of play or shot into a Wigan defender, he pulled an intelligent ball back for Fernandes. Liam Shaw stretched out a leg in an attempt to intercept Rashford\u2019s pass and that was all the invitation the United captain required to go to ground after a slight touch of toes. The referee, Anthony Taylor, took his time before pointing to the spot, to the disgust of the majority of the DW Stadium, and Fernandes ignored the jeers to send Tickle the wrong way with a cool penalty into the bottom corner."

            "date": "2024-01-20T17:57:33Z",
            "content": "Ollie Chessum was a high-profile casualty of Leicester\u2019s Champions Cup defeat by Leinster, handing England an injury scare before they head to Girona for a Six Nations training camp on Tuesday. The England second row trudged off in the 43rd minute of the Tigers\u2019 defeat \u2013 which leaves them uncertain of a place in the last 16 \u2013 and failed his head injury assessment, meaning at the very least he will be unable to take a full part in England training next week. It is a blow for Steve Borthwick, who has already lost Leicester\u2019s George Martin for a \u201cnumber of weeks\u201d to a knee injury and all of a sudden looks light at second row with Chessum set to be assessed before England depart for Spain. How Leicester could have done with both for the full 80 minutes against star-studded Leinster who, thanks to the inspired James Lowe, secured a dogged victory that underlined their title credentials. Lowe was the standout performer for Leinster who on paper were packed with star quality and on the pitch showed enough of it to deny Leicester the losing bonus point they needed. The Tigers can still make the last 16 but will have to wait on the outcome of Sale\u2019s match against La Rochelle to be sure. They can hardly argue, for all their industry, the Tigers were considerably short on imagination and Leinster had only to occasionally move through the gears to claim victory over Leicester for the third season in succession. It was an absorbing spectacle nonetheless, witnessed by a sell-out crowd at Welford Road, but if this is a harbinger for the Six Nations, as matches at this stage of the competition can be, Ireland are shaping up well considering all 15 of their starters have been named in Andy Farrell\u2019s squad for the championship. They scored four tries \u2013 the consistently impressive Joe McCarthy scoring the first with Jordan Larmour, Dan Sheehan and Caelan Doris adding the rest \u2013 ensuring another bonus point in a 100% pool stage record. They finish with 19 points and with a home last-16 match guaranteed \u2013 no mean feat given the strength of the pool they were drawn in. Leicester did, however, have their illustrious opponents rattled in the opening stages. The returning Hanro Liebenberg scored the first try after taking a smart pass from Dan Kelly and running in on the left and Handr\u00e8 Pollard converted before adding a penalty for a 10-0 lead. That was as good as it got for Tigers who failed to score a point thereafter. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated for [the players], I spoke about it being a Test match,\u201d said Leicester\u2019s head coach Dan McKellar. \u201cThe reality is we didn\u2019t take opportunities at key moments and they did.\u201d A Harry Byrne penalty in front of the posts got Leinster up and running but it was the excellence of Lowe that dragged last year\u2019s losing finalists back into the match. Using his booming left boot to impressive effect and repeatedly cropping up in midfield, the winger was a galvanising force for the visitors. It was also his powerful break down the left and offload to Garry Ringrose that began the move which ultimately resulted in Larmour stepping his way over for Leinster\u2019s second try after McCarthy had powered over for their first. Byrne had converted the first try but failed to do so with the second and when Leicester held Doris up under the posts just before the half-time interval, Tigers were at least in touching distance, trailing by five points. They had, however, lost the wing Harry Simmons to a painful looking facial injury. Three minutes into the second half they also lost scrum-half Tom Whiteley to the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-on after another move sparked by Lowe and from the resulting penalty, Dan Sheehan was soon going over at the back of a lineout drive for Leinster\u2019s third try. The introductions from the bench of Kyle Hatherell and Ben Youngs made a difference and suddenly the Tigers found themselves camped in the Leinster 22. Their chances of scoring improved when Jack Conan was sent to the sin-bin but Doris\u2019 crucial turnover on his own line continued to keep Leicester at bay. The Tigers kept huffing and puffing but a wobbling lineout and an attack shorn of the necessary quality ensured they came up short as Doris had the final word from close range."

            "date": "2024-01-07T18:46:14Z",
            "content": "It was one of those days when Arsenal might have played for another 90 minutes and failed to score. It was all so deeply frustrating for Mikel Arteta and the home support. The sting in the tail, however, would devastate them, sparking boos at full-time and the feeling that the club have stumbled into a mini-crisis. Liverpool\u2019s joy knew no bounds. There had been the impression that this FA Cup tie was more important for Arsenal, given the form that they had taken into it \u2013 three Premier League defeats in five. The need for them to recover momentum was greater. Liverpool, sitting pretty at the top of the table, also had the security of their shot at Carabao Cup glory; they face Fulham in the first leg of their semi-final at Anfield on Wednesday. It was Liverpool who rode out the Arsenal storm or, to put it another way, watched them repeatedly lack the needed ruthlessness in front of goal; for Arteta, it is an increasingly worrying trend. And then J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team hit them hard. The opening goal on 80 minutes was a body blow for Arsenal, the excellent Trent Alexander-Arnold whipping in a free-kick from the left and Jakub Kiwior, under no huge pressure, directing an attempted clearing header into his own net. The die was cast. Top of the league at Christmas but now down to fourth, Arsenal have had a sinking feeling. Luis D\u00edaz would add further insult at the bitter end, lashing into the near top corner after a break involving Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez and the substitute Diogo Jota. In a sense this was the hors d\u2019oeuvre before the main course of the league meeting between the clubs here on 4 February. But if it was Liverpool laying down a marker \u2013 and doing so without Virgil van Dijk, who was ill, Mohamed Salah, who is on Africa Cup of Nations duty, and a host of others \u2013 it has to be said that the FA Cup still matters. Arteta had described last Sunday\u2019s league defeat at Fulham as the low point of the season, a \u201cpainful and sad day\u201d, and he got a reaction from his players, Arsenal storming out of the blocks, the flashing lights on the underside of Bukayo Saka\u2019s boots not the only eye-catching detail. The winger would change into a more conventional pair later in the first-half. Yet it was possible to wonder at an early juncture whether they would live to regret their profligacy. Martin \u00d8degaard should have scored on 11 minutes, thumping onto the crossbar when well placed, and it was not the only good chance that Arsenal created in the early running. Reiss Nelson, starting ahead of Gabriel Martinelli on the left, almost rounded Alisson at the very start, following a long ball by his club\u2019s domestic cup goalkeeper, Aaron Ramsdale, while he would see another effort deflect wide. Kai Havertz also worked Alisson with a curler. The major team news item had been Liverpool\u2019s loss of Van Dijk. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for Virg to look shit but he did,\u201d Klopp said. The Liverpool manager would reel off a long list of other absentees and he loaded his substitutes\u2019 bench with youngsters. Conor Bradley and Bobby Clark would get on in the 75th minute. Jarell Quansah emerged with honours as Van Dijk\u2019s deputy in central defence. Arteta used Havertz up top in the absence of the injured Gabriel Jesus and he had decent chances to score before the interval. Twice Havertz dallied before shooting without much conviction and there was the moment when he headed wide on a corner after levering Quansah out of the way. Ben White had won it when he forced Alisson to tip over a rising drive. Klopp lamented Liverpool\u2019s inability to get their press right in the first half, beginning with the front players, and it was practically all Arsenal before the interval. Yet Liverpool, for whom N\u00fa\u00f1ez had glanced wide on a 22nd minute corner, almost stole the lead at the end of the half. Alexander-Arnold ran on to an inviting ball up the inside right and unfurled a venomous shot that made a serious mark on the crossbar. Alexander-Arnold had done something similar in the 1-1 league draw between the teams at Anfield before Christmas. Arsenal, wearing an all-white kit as part of their No More Red anti-knife crime initiative, continued to push at the start of the second half. It turned into a psychological test, as much as anything else, and it was draining to watch Arteta on the touchline. Twice Saka blew opportunities after crosses to the far post. Klopp reshuffled. On came Jota in the No 9 role, N\u00fa\u00f1ez moving to the left. On came Ryan Gravenberch as the left-sided No 8, Curtis Jones moving to No 6. Slowly but surely Liverpool grew in confidence, from back to front, and they began to advertise the breakthrough. N\u00fa\u00f1ez missed a pass to D\u00edaz on the break. Jota sliced from left to right and fed D\u00edaz, whose low shot was brilliantly saved by Ramsdale. From the ensuing corner, Jota rose to head against the crossbar. Arsenal were gripped by angst. They would eventually be overwhelmed."

            "content": "\u201cIt\u2019s the hope that kills you,\u201d reflected a less-than-optimistic Middlesbrough supporter as he made his way to Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night. How Mauricio Pochettino can relate to that sentiment. Yet after a ruthless performance that blew away their opponents from the Championship during an impressive first half, perhaps Chelsea\u2019s manager is finally on to something? Reaching the Carabao Cup final is the least Todd Boehly and co could expect having already spent more than \u00a31bn in transfer fees since stepping into Roman Abramovich\u2019s shoes 18 months ago. This was compelling evidence that, after a nightmare 2023 with Graham Potter and all that, the future could be very bright indeed for Chelsea\u2019s brave new era. Pochettino allowed himself a small fist-pump and smile when the outstanding Cole Palmer stroked home Chelsea\u2019s fourth goal five minutes before the break to make it 4-1 on aggregate. How he will be savouring the opportunity to return to Wembley for his first domestic cup final appearance since losing against Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Chelsea in this competition in 2015. While the former Argentina defender rid himself of the mantle of never having won a trophy during his spell at Paris Saint\u2011Germain, he was often criticised for a reluctance to take domestic cup competitions seriously during his five-and-a-bit seasons at Tottenham. It might have something to do with the fact that Chelsea still find themselves 12 points behind Aston Villa in fourth in the Premier League despite three successive wins but that approach seems to have changed significantly. Pochettino had described this match as his biggest since arriving in west London at the start of the season and in his programme notes he made reference to the jubilant atmosphere that followed their dramatic penalty shootout victory against Newcastle in the previous round. \u201cThose moments bring confidence and positivity to everyone and tonight we want to achieve the same feeling again,\u201d he wrote. However, it was the visiting supporters packing out the Shed End behind Tom Glover\u2019s goal who created the atmosphere despite the swirling wind and rain at Stamford Bridge. Their mood was only slightly dampened when Jonny Howson inadvertently diverted the ball past the Middlesbrough goalkeeper as he attempted to stop Armando Broja from finishing off a move started by the rampaging Ben Chilwell. The England left-back has endured an awful run of injuries but his long-awaited return at last means Pochettino can field a more balanced defence with Levi Colwill looking far more assured in a central role. It was from the opposite flank that Chelsea doubled their lead, Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez tapping home for his fourth of the season after Axel Disasi raced onto Raheem Sterling\u2019s clever backheel. Suddenlyas Middlesbrough\u2019s hopes of becoming the first team outside of the Premier League to reach the EFL Cup final since the League Two side Bradford in 2013 were teetering on the brink of extinction. Disasi\u2019s interception before applying the finish after a surging run forward made it almost inevitable and when Palmer \u2013 who excelled having shifted to No 10 after Mykhailo Mudryk was selected to start ahead of Conor Gallagher \u2013 made it four, even Boro\u2019s supporters were stunned into silence. To their credit, they soon found their voices again as Michael Carrick\u2019s side refused to throw in the towel in the second half. But having withdrawn Mudryk at the break for Noni Madueke, Chelsea \u2013 who had recorded just three home wins between January and November last year but are now unbeaten in their past nine matches here \u2013 continued to pose a major threat down both flanks. Raheem Sterling had wreaked havoc against Middlesbrough\u2019s left-back Lukas Engel in the first half, he must have been relieved to see the England forward switched to the opposite side. Sterling was Boehly\u2019s first signing when the 28-year-old completed his move from Manchester City in the summer of 2022 and he has struggled for consistency. His performance here shows he still has plenty to offer a young squad that lacks experience despite the presence of the 39-year-old Thiago Silva at the heart of the defence. Sterling has not played for England since the 2022 World Cup quarter\u2011final defeat against France in Qatar and, having been ignored for the past four squads by Gareth Southgate, he now has a plethora of rivals to get past: not least Palmer. An assured first\u2011time finish with his right foot took the 21-year-old to 11 goals in all competitions this season for Chelsea as they made it 5-0 with 10 minutes to play before Madueke rounded off the rout moments later. Conceding a sixth goal only made Middlesbrough\u2019s fans sing even louder before an excellent finish from Morgan Rogers, who has been linked with a move to Aston Villa this month, gave them another reason to celebrate. They didn\u2019t seem to care about being reminded by their Chelsea counterparts that it is them who are on their way to Wembley. It may only be in the Carabao Cup but, as Pochettino \u2013 who shared a giant hug and a joke with Carrick at the full-time whistle before enjoying a tender moment with the home supporters \u2013 would testify, you have to start somewhere."

            "content": "Valdo Calocane had been suffering from extreme mental illness for years before he launched his violent rampage through the streets of Nottingham in June last year, and questions are now being asked about why he was not under closer supervision. The 32-year-old has paranoid schizophrenia, and for years experienced psychotic delusions in which he believed he was being targeted by \u201cmalign forces\u201d and agencies such as MI5 who were controlling his thoughts and actions. Despite alarming warning signs \u2013 including numerous violent outbursts and a plea for MI5 to arrest him \u2013 he evaded authorities for months and had been left untreated for almost a year at the time he killed three people and attempted to kill three others. Dr Sanjoy Kumar, the father of Grace O\u2019Malley-Kumar, said her killer had misled psychiatrists and that the failure to formally charge him for a number of previous violent incidents was a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d that may have \u201caltered his course\u201d. The case has disturbing similarities to that of Zephaniah McLeod, who killed 23-year-old Jacob Billington and injured seven others in a violent and random stabbing spree in Birmingham in September 2020. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and a report on his treatment found he had been released from prison months before the attack with no restrictions or supervision despite experiencing delusions and refusing to take medication. Here is a timeline of Calocane\u2019s engagement with mental health services, and the chances to stop him before he turned to violence. 23 May 2020 It is thought the symptoms of Calocane\u2019s schizophrenia began in 2019, but he first came into contact with mental health services in May 2020 when he went to A&amp;E believing he was having a heart attack. Afterwards he returned to his home in Nottingham and knocked down a door to another apartment in his block. He was arrested for criminal damage, and assessed as psychotic when taken in to custody, but released without charge. On returning home, he almost immediately knocked down another apartment door. He was arrested and, this time, sectioned. 14 July 2020 Less than a month after being discharged, Calocane was hospitalised again after he stopped taking his medication and broke into another apartment. He was discharged on 31 July, then managed in the community by an early intervention psychosis team, and his medication was increased. May 2021 The following year, Calocane\u2019s family reported that his mental health had deteriorated and that he had reported hearing voices telling him his family members would die. But he was \u201cactively concealing symptoms of psychosis\u201d from medics, prosecutor Karim Khalil KC told the court. He admitted he had stopped taking his medication and had no intention of continuing his treatment. 3 September 2021 After evading contact with a community mental health team, a warrant was issued for a search of Calocane\u2019s property. Eight months\u2019 worth of unused medication was found and his behaviour was hostile. He was sectioned again, and assaulted a police officer while being transported to Highbury hospital in Nottingham. After being released in October, he missed mental health appointments and often appeared confrontational, Khalil said. January 2022 Calocane was involved in an altercation with his flatmate, and on 27 January he was sectioned again, for three weeks, after failing to engage with at-home mental health services. It was later found that Calocane first started buying weapons in 2022 as voices were telling him to harm others, psychiatrists said. 31 May 2022 Calocane travelled to London and attempted to hand himself in to MI5, who he believed were controlling him, at their Thames House headquarters, urging them to \u201cplease arrest me\u201d. July 2022 A community mental health service prompted Calocane to collect his medication, but he lied and said he was out of the country. On 4 August, a mental health team visited his discharge address but were told Calocane no longer lived there. 22 September 2022 Calocane was due to appear in court for the assault of the police officer in September 2021, but he failed to attend and a warrant was issued for his arrest. That warrant was still outstanding nine months later when he was arrested for the attacks in Nottingham, and police have admitted they should have done more to track him down. 13 June 2023 Khalil said Calocane was \u201cunmedicated and out of touch with psychiatric services for almost 12 months\u201d in June last year when he carried out the attacks. He claims he committed the crimes because voices in his head told him to, and he hadn\u2019t sought help because he believed the doctors who had been treating him were involved in controlling him."

            "date": "2024-01-05T11:59:20Z",
            "content": "Keir Starmer has downgraded his target of spending \u00a328bn a year on green investment schemes in the next parliament to an \u201cambition\u201d, in the latest sign of the Labour leader backing away from his flagship green policy. Starmer said on Friday he wanted to reach the \u00a328bn figure by the second half of the parliament if Labour won the next election, but could not guarantee that he would be able to do so. His comments are the clearest admission yet that Labour is willing to spend less if it means keeping its promise to get debt falling as a proportion of economic output. Speaking during a listener phone-in on LBC radio, Starmer said: \u201c[The \u00a328bn plan] is subject to our fiscal rules, it\u2019s an ambition. One of the rules is that debt has to be falling as a percentage of GDP. \u201cI\u2019m confident. We\u2019re talking about where we might be in 2027. So being a careful and cautious former lawyer, I know that the world can change. Four or five years ago, we didn\u2019t know we were going to hit Covid or Ukraine. I\u2019m confident that we can get to that figure [but] in the end, the fiscal rule comes first.\u201d Asked by LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari whether the figure was a pledge or a \u201cgold-plated ambition\u201d, Starmer said: \u201cIt\u2019s a confident ambition.\u201d The Labour leader has put green investment at the heart of his policy pitch to voters, promising to decarbonise Britain\u2019s power sector by 2030. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, announced in 2021 that this would be achieved in part by the government spending \u00a328bn a year until 2030 on technologies such as battery power and electric vehicles. In recent months, however, Reeves and Starmer have dialled down the ambition of the plan. Reeves announced last year a Labour government would only hit the \u00a328bn target in the second half of a parliament, and would borrow less to avoid missing its fiscal targets. Starmer said on Thursday that the party would not borrow the full amount of money if it meant missing the debt target, but appeared to leave open the possibility he would tax more or find the money from other parts of government spending. His comments on Friday appear to confirm, however, that he is happy to miss the spending target to protect the debt rule. Labour has said it will take into account the \u00a38bn the government has already pledged towards green schemes, leaving it to find an extra \u00a320bn by the end of the parliament. Economists estimate that at the end of the current five-year period there is room to borrow an extra \u00a313bn while still having debt falling as a proportion of GDP. Labour insists that once it gets into government the \u201cheadroom\u201d will grow because of its pro-growth policies. If that does not happen, however, it will mean the party only has enough space to fund about two-thirds of its plan. Party officials are locked in talks over how they should present the reshaped green investment programme to voters as Starmer embarks on a national tour of British towns talking to voters. Some believe he should be more explicit about dropping the \u00a328bn figure altogether, while others say doing so would leave him open to accusations that his promises cannot be trusted."

            "date": "2024-01-27T08:00:31Z",
            "content": "Hands Off Hibs was one of the most successful movements of its kind in British football. The audacious attempts of Wallace Mercer, the then Heart of Midlothian chairman, to purchase a major shareholding in Hibernian met with shock, vehement opposition and outright hostility. The bid, announced casually in an Edinburgh hotel, was a leading item on the Six O\u2019Clock News on 4 June 1990. Mercer\u2019s plan was flawed on umpteen levels. Threats to his life and the necessity for 24-hour security around the businessman emphasised that not all of his detractors were rational. Nonetheless, the byproduct of his merger bid was the mobilising of the Hibs support to a level that sufficiently impressed Tom Farmer. Under Farmer, Hibs were not only saved as a Scottish sporting institution but stabilised. Decades later, Hearts would need an unbeatable supporter front of their own as the business slid into administration. The Foundation of Hearts now owns 75% of what really is its club. Supporting Hearts or Hibs has never been one of Scottish football\u2019s soft options. Long before the end of a wounding midweek defeat by Rangers, Hibs fans were streaming out of Easter Road. It is galling enough to lose heavily at home without knowledge that the opposition is distinctly average. There is routinely a hopelessness now when Scottish top-flight clubs face Celtic and Rangers: turn up, take a pounding, be glad it is all over. The league remains horrendously noncompetitive. Hibs think they have something to break the mould. Bill Foley, the owner of Bournemouth, will purchase a minority stake in the club pending the meeting of conditions laid down by the Scottish Football Association. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be a controlling shareholder,\u201d said Foley. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be an investor, but we certainly want to coordinate acquisition and disposition of players with Hibs and I know they can use the help.\u201d This sounds ominously like considerable power for little accountability. Foley was upbeat after buying a \u201csignificant minority ownership interest\u201d in the French club Lorient last January. After 18 Ligue 1 games, Lorient sit bottom with 12 points. The Hibs deal is not in isolation. Tony Bloom, the Brighton owner, is known to have at least pondered investing in a Scottish club. Bournemouth and Hibs are thought by many to be the thin end of a wedge. The Scottish FA does at least have rules relating to dual interest, hence the Foley deal taking months to conclude. Yet it may be a stretch to think officialdom will keep the clubs involved on a tight leash. In a recent appearance before the Scottish parliament, Ian Maxwell, the governing body\u2019s chief executive, was scornful of the need for an independent regulator for the national sport. Maxwell claimed the withstanding of \u201cextreme financial pressure\u201d \u2013 including the impact of Covid \u2013 was not relevant in the Scottish game. On Thursday, the Scottish Professional Football League announced Edinburgh City had been docked six points for a failure to pay wages and properly report an HMRC default. Dundee United\u2019s most recent accounts depict a club with a turnover of \u00a38.2m and a balance sheet loan debt to the owner of more than \u00a310m. The politicians should be calling Maxwell back for round two. Covid actually remains a live issue, including because umpteen clubs took out government loans during the pandemic. Burnley\u2019s owner, ALK Capital, has confirmed a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d with Dundee. \u201cThe Scottish Premiership is an excellent proving ground to progress young and emerging talent, as well as providing a potential gateway to European competition,\u201d said the Burnley chairman, Alan Pace. Dundee last played in Europe in 2003. In 2022, Ayr United launched a claret and blue third strip to mark a strategic partnership with Burnley. Nobody seems to know what happened next. Rather than eyeing Europe, Burnley are bound for the Championship. Supporters must dare to dream. Followers of Hibs believe association with Foley can help edge them closer to the Old Firm. Dundee\u2019s fans think a gap can be bridged towards teams who have spending ability far beyond their own. Yet a degree of cynicism is valid here. Hibs have a \u00a3700,000 centre-forward and still sit mid-table. The level of finance needed to change things materially at Easter Road is huge. More important, should esteemed Scottish clubs become subservient to English masters because of Premier League pound signs? It is a rather depressing thought, where Hibs and Dundee could be stripped of their right to operate on a standalone basis. And on what basis? What, precisely, is in this for the English clubs? The Premiership is not producing Premier League players. It could be argued multi-club formats have done other leagues no harm. There is also the case for something, anything that brings cash towards Scottish football being welcomed. This, however, is verging on desperation. Loans from England to Scotland can work \u2013 indeed, Dundee had recent success with Liverpool\u2019s Owen Beck \u2013 but there are countless tales of short-term moves north from far bigger clubs than Bournemouth and Burnley having no effect. Beck emphasised the short-term nature of it all, J\u00fcrgen Klopp recalling him after half a season. Hibs\u2019 star recruit from Bournemouth, Emiliano Marcondes, didn\u2019t play a game between May and the last half-hour of the Rangers loss. The estimated market value of Scotland\u2019s under-23 players places the country 24th in Europe and ninth among nations with a population of 10 million or less. Scotland is ranked 31st in the continent for starts by its own players in Uefa club competitions during seasons 2021-22 and 2022-23. Improvement has to come far closer to home. There is no requirement for Hands Off Hibs to get the band back together. Burnley and Bournemouth are surely full of good intentions. The erosion of football traditions began long ago. Some things, such as vague parent club deals, are just enough to leave onlookers cold. Scottish football continues to fumble around in the dark.

            "date": "2024-01-09T16:01:39Z",
            "content": "Microsoft\u2019s multibillion-dollar investment in the ChatGPT developer OpenAI could face a merger investigation in the European Union, officials have said. Microsoft is the largest minority investor in OpenAI Global LLC, a \u201ccapped profit\u201d subsidiary company that is controlled by OpenAI Inc, the non-profit majority owner of the organisation. Its investment, given in the form of cloud-computing credits as well as cash, officially gives it no control of the company itself, but the possibility of a maximum of a 100-times return on its capital. The European Commission said on Tuesday it was \u201cchecking whether Microsoft\u2019s investment in OpenAI might be reviewable under the EU merger regulation\u201d. OpenAI\u2019s unusual corporate structure was thrust into the limelight last year, when its chief executive, Sam Altman, was ousted and then reappointed in a bitter struggle with the non-profit\u2019s board. Despite having no legal sway over the outcome, Microsoft intervened heavily in the dispute, in part by offering Altman and any other OpenAI staff a job in its own organisation. Since the conflict, OpenAI\u2019s own description of Microsoft\u2019s involvement has changed. In November, a chart on the company\u2019s website detailing its structure described Microsoft as a \u201cminority owner\u201d. That chart was then quietly updated to read \u201cminority economic interest\u201d instead. Before that update, the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority said in December it was gathering information about the precise relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI. The EU\u2019s investigation into AI and virtual worlds will also involve \u201clooking into some of the agreements that have been concluded between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers\u201d, to investigate their impact on market dynamics. Last month Drago\u0219 Tudorache, an MEP and the lead on the artificial intelligence committee in the European parliament, told the Guardian it was vital the EU did not make the mistakes of the 2000s when emerging tech companies, including Facebook, were allowed to dictate the terms of their service. Without regulation on the content or effective control of acquisitions and mergers, they were able to dominate the market by snapping up companies and also competing with traditional media without paying for content, undermining the business models of rivals."

            "date": "2024-01-05T06:00:26Z",
            "content": "Labour\u2019s independent energy advisers have warned the party against watering down its \u00a328bn green spending plans in advance of its promise to create a zero carbon electricity system by 2030. Experts at the climate thinktank Ember, which provided the independent analysis underpinning Labour\u2019s green targets, said growing international competition for low-carbon investment from the US and EU could leave the UK lagging in the global race for low-carbon energy. The research has shown that Labour\u2019s ambitious plans to break Britain\u2019s reliance on gas power plants, which provided more than 30% of the UK\u2019s electricity last year, was technically possible within this decade. But the thinktank\u2019s analysts said cutting back on spending plans would move Britain in \u201ccompletely the wrong direction\u201d. The 2030 goal would require big investments in clean energy infrastructure. Under the plans, wind and solar would make up about 70% of the electricity mix in 2030, while 30% of the UK\u2019s electricity would come from a mixture of other low-carbon sources including new nuclear reactors, other renewables and hydrogen. Harriet Fox, an energy and climate analyst at Ember, said: \u201cWhat I would say is that now is not the time to pull back on investment, when the rest of the world is starting to gear up. It\u2019s completely the wrong direction. With the US and the EU now vying for the attention of green energy companies the UK does not want to be left behind.\u201d Labour cast doubt on its plans to remove virtually all carbon emissions from the UK\u2019s electricity system by the end of the decade, five years ahead of the government\u2019s existing plans, after admitting that economic pressure on public spending could mean that its earlier \u00a328bn promise was not sacrosanct. Sources within the party have argued that this spending target was designed to achieve more than a virtually zero-carbon power system by 2030 by creating homegrown green jobs and boosting local supply chain companies. The 2030 target could still be achieved with lower public spending by overhauling the UK\u2019s regulatory and planning systems to help private sector investment to play a bigger role, one source said. Some of the biggest barriers to the UK\u2019s green energy targets hinge on significant hurdles in the UK\u2019s planning system, which has slowed the pace at which green projects can connect to the power grid. The Labour party also accused the government of overseeing an \u201cenergy security disaster\u201d last year after it failed to attract any new investors to a key offshore wind subsidy auction. Investments in big green energy projects and grid infrastructure are expected to lower household energy bills in the long term by making cheap renewable energy more available. Research by Ember found households could save \u00a3300 a year on energy bills by 2030 by running a 98% zero carbon electricity grid. \u201cThe investment that a government makes now, will pay for itself in the future,\u201d Fox said. \u201cIt will be paid back through lower energy bills because the greener our energy system becomes the cheaper it will be for the consumer. Investment today, will only be beneficial in the long run.\u201d"

            "content": "Negotiations over a trade deal between the UK and Canada have been halted after disagreements on beef and cheese tariffs. The ability for the UK to secure its own global free trade deals was sold as one major benefit from the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU but progress has been mixed. Here we look at what agreements have been struck so far and with whom, and which other important economies are still at the negotiating table and why. Trade deals agreed so far Japan When in late 2020 the then international secretary, Liz Truss, signed the UK\u2019s first major post-Brexit free trade agreement, she said that when it came into force the next year it would boost trade between the two countries by billions of pounds annually. However, exports to Japan have not quite received the turbo charge promised, falling to \u00a311.9bn in the year to June 2022, from \u00a312.3bn the year before. This included a 4.9% fall in export for goods, to \u00a36.1bn, while services fell 2%, to \u00a35.8bn. Australia The deal in December 2021 was almost entirely focused on goods, with tariffs being eliminated on exports from both countries for a 15-year period. The government said it would unlock \u00a310.4bn of additional trade with the country by the 2030s while ending tariffs on all UK exports. Others were not so positive, with UK farmers angry that Australia had been given full access to sell beef and sheep meat in the UK while there was a ban on beef going the other way. A year later, George Eustice, the former environment minister who was part of the negotiations, said it \u201cwas not actually a very good deal for Britain\u201d and \u201cgave away far too much for far too little in return\u201d. New Zealand This February 2022 deal largely mirrored the Australian one, with similar concerns from UK meat farmers about being undercut by cheaper imports. Tariffs of up to 10% on products were removed from most products, while visa restrictions for travel and residency were eased. The government estimated that this would add \u00a3800m a year to the UK economy by the mid-2030s but the overall impact was negligible, representing just a 0.03% boost to GDP by 2035. The Australian and New Zealand trade deals came into effect in last May. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership While technically not a new trade deal, the UK\u2019s joining of the CPTPP means a range of export products can be traded tariff-free with the member nations, which include Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, Canada and Mexico but not the US. The deal, agreed last March, also means countries must adhere to certain unified regulations, such as food standards. However, the CPTPP arrangements can be overridden by individual trade deals with specific countries, which is why the UK is still trying to secure direct deals with member states such as Canada. Analysis has found that exporting to countries in the CPTPP accounted for 8% of UK exports in 2019, less than the UK\u2019s total trade with Germany. The deals still not struck The US Negotiations began in May 2020 and nearly four years later there is no prospect of an agreement any time soon. Last month Joe Biden signalled he had shelved plans for a deal until at least after this November\u2019s US presidential election. India When negotiations began between India and the UK at the start of 2022, it was hoped that by as early as that October there would be a deal reducing tariffs on exports such as cars and Scottish whisky and providing better access to the world\u2019s fifth biggest economy. However, we are still waiting, with experts saying any pact is unlikely before the Indian national elections this spring. Others As well as Canada, talks are continuing with other nations including Israel, Mexico and South Korea. The UK began negotiating with the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, in July 2022. Experts have predicted that a deal with Switzerland, which is the sixth biggest market for the UK to export services to, could be the next reached."

            "content": "Russia and Ukraine have traded accusations over the fatal crash of a military transport plane that Moscow claims was carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war and was shot down by Kyiv\u2019s forces. The Russian Il-76 was filmed crashing on Wednesday in a huge ball of fire in a rural area of Russia near the border with Ukraine. Moscow quickly accused Kyiv of downing the large aircraft and said it was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war who were being transported for a prisoner exchange. Ukrainian officials on Thursday did not explicitly deny shooting down the aircraft but said they could not confirm that Ukrainian soldiers on their way to a prisoner exchange were onboard the plane. Some officials in Kyiv cast doubt on Russia\u2019s claim that PoWs were onboard. Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine\u2019s human rights ombudsman, wrote on X: \u201cCurrently, there are no signs of the fact that there were so many people on the Il-76 plane, be they citizens of Ukraine or not. \u201cUkraine demands a transparent international investigation regarding the downing of this plane.\u201d The cause of the crash remains unknown. Kyiv previously confirmed a prisoner exchange was due to take place on Wednesday at the border between the two countries but said Moscow did not inform them that any prisoners of war would be transported by plane. Ukraine\u2019s SBU security service on Thursday opened a criminal investigation into the crash, saying it would look into possible \u201cviolations of the laws and customs of war\u201d. On Wednesday evening, the Ukrainian president called for an international investigation into the crash, accusing Moscow of \u201cplaying with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners of war\u201d. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly video broadcast: \u201cIt is clear that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners, the feelings of their loved ones and the emotions of our society.\u201d Russia\u2019s access to the area where the crash happened is likely to hamper any future investigation and no independent groups have yet visited the site. Both sides offered conflicting narratives over the hours preceding the plane crash. A senior Russian lawmaker said Ukrainian military intelligence had been given a 15-minute warning before a Russian military transport plane carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war entered an area where it was shot down. Andrey Kartapolov, who heads Russia\u2019s Duma defence committee, told lawmakers on Thursday: \u201cThe Ukrainian side was officially warned, and 15 minutes before the plane entered the zone they were given complete information, which they received and the main intelligence directorate of the Ukrainian armed forces confirmed receipt of.\u201d Ukraine rejected Kartapolov\u2019s claims, stating that Moscow had not informed it of the flight arrangements. The Ukrainian military intelligence spokesperson Andriy Yusov said on Thursday that contrary to practice before previous PoW swaps, Kyiv had received no requests from Russia to refrain from offensive actions. Nevertheless, Yusov appeared to hint that Ukrainian PoWs could have been onboard, telling Radio Svoboda: \u201cUnfortunately, we can assume various scenarios, including provocation, as well as the use of Ukrainian prisoners as a human shield for transporting ammunition and weapons for S-300 systems [being used in the war].\u201d The Kremlin on Thursday stuck to its position that Ukraine had downed the plane, with Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson describing it as \u201ca totally monstrous act\u201d. Conflicting narratives from both sides have become a daily occurrence in a war that is now nearing the end of its second year. Many of Russia\u2019s denials and accusations during the war have proved to be demonstrably untrue, including Moscow\u2019s claims that the country has not targeted civilians in Ukraine."

            "date": "2024-01-30T16:12:50Z",
            "content": "The first reviews of Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, from publications with early access to the company\u2019s attempt to create the next computing platform, talk of a big leap forward for face-mounted computers, for better or worse. The US-only headset, first announced in June last year, aims to move \u201cspatial computing\u201d beyond the limited mixed-reality offered by rivals from Meta, Microsoft and others. It is packed with cutting-edge technology including 3D cameras on the front to capture videos, the ability to blend the real and virtual worlds with hand and eye tracking, plus a display on the front that shows a simulacrum of the wearer\u2019s eyes. But at a cost of $3,499 (about \u00a32,760) in the US it has a lot of work to do to convince consumers and developers alike that it can be anything other than a super-expensive niche toy for tech enthusiasts. The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel called the Vision Pro an \u201castounding product\u201d but one with a lot of big trade-offs, including messing up your hair each time you put it on: \u201cApple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason \u2013 they represent a huge leap forward in display technology,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey also look generally incredible \u2013 sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for colour at the factory so they are also vibrant and colour-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge.\u201d But he said that while the passthrough view of the real world is the very best yet, \u201cthe field of view isn\u2019t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won\u2019t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro\u2019s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3\u2019s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you\u2019re seeing, a bit like you\u2019re looking through binoculars.\u201d CNBC\u2019s Todd Haselton was impressed by the hardware and experience: \u201cI loved watching movies with the headset. I lounged on my couch and put up a huge screen across the wall of my living room and watched an hour of Barbie and the two first episodes of Masters of the Air before the battery was at about 5%. Another night I watched Greyhound. I used the NBA app, which was updated to work on the Vision Pro, to stream four games at once, with the main game in the middle and others pinned to the sides. It\u2019s wild,\u201d he wrote. But he encountered the dreaded app gap problem that plagues new devices. \u201cThe Vision Pro supports more than a million iPhone and iPad apps. But you need to search for each app individually and some of them aren\u2019t available. Netflix and Spotify haven\u2019t been shy about not supporting the Vision Pro, though you can easily access either using the browser. Still, there are lots of others that I couldn\u2019t find: 1Password isn\u2019t there, which made logging into some apps a bit of a pain. You won\u2019t find Uber, DoorDash (but there\u2019s GrubHub!) or Amazon. None of Google\u2019s apps are here, including YouTube TV, though it works fine in the browser. \u201cPopular games like Diablo Immortal and Genshin Impact aren\u2019t available. Facebook\u2019s apps aren\u2019t here, so no Instagram. These are just a few I noticed.\u201d The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Joanna Stern found the Vision Pro was actually good for getting work done, with virtual windows dotted across your view or replicating a Mac\u2019s display, as long as you have other bits of hardware: \u201cThere is a built-in virtual keyboard so you can type in thin air. But it will drive you mad for anything longer than a short message. And selecting smaller buttons with a pinch should be a carnival game. I started getting real work done once I paired the Vision Pro with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. \u201cI levelled up again by connecting my MacBook Pro, which let me write this review on a giant virtual monitor hovering over my desk.\u201d But was it heavy? \u201cOh yes. The metal and glass build gives it a premium look and a weighty feel. One included band has a top strap to lessen the face crush; the other wraps around your head like a comfy tube sock. The Light Seal (not a breed of sea mammal) acts as a cushion and light blocker. Mine is now covered with makeup.\u201d Weight is one of the reasons the headset has an external battery pack tethered to it by a cable, but even then Patel found the magnesium, carbon fibre and aluminium headset a daunting prospect: \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it\u2019s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it\u2019s an iPad for your face.\u201d Mark Spoonauer, of Tom\u2019s Guide, found the battery pack to be one of the most annoying things: \u201cThe aluminum battery on the Vision Pro always needs to be with you to use the headset, which is not great. So you\u2019ll need to put it in your pocket while standing or next to you while sitting. It\u2019s 12.4 ounces, which is heavier than an iPhone 15 Pro Max (7.8 ounces). And while the cord is long enough most of the time, if you\u2019re really immersed in a game or other experience and you move suddenly, you could accidentally tug the battery off a table or couch on to the floor.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m also not a fan of how the cord to the battery can sometimes get a bit tangled. A couple of times I had to disconnect the cable so it would straighten out.\u201d Cnet\u2019s Scott Stein said the Vision Pro was \u201ca stunning look at the future\u201d, including ones envisioned in sci-fi: \u201cApple is also expecting the Vision Pro to be a place to see all your own life moments, reliving them like a scene out of Minority Report. I tried watching recorded \u2018spatial videos\u2019, which are 3D videos that I previously shot on an iPhone 15 Pro. I also played back 3D videos and photos recorded directly with Vision Pro, which has its own cameras. \u201cThe photo and video quality in 3D isn\u2019t as good as Apple\u2019s stunning 180-degree immersive video format, not even close. But when expanded to a fuzzy-bordered viewing mode, it starts to feel like a replayed memory. I went back to the holidays, to the Museum of Natural History, to a hotpot dinner with a friend in San Francisco, to a snowball fight with my kid. I started to forget where I was and imagined I could just walk into the moment.\u201d Stein said the Vision Pro was the best wearable display he had ever put on, but still a tough sell in its current form. \u201cAt its price, and with so few VisionOS apps at launch, the Vision Pro isn\u2019t a device I\u2019d recommend to any of my friends or family. If you\u2019re in the immersive industry and can afford one then that\u2019s another story. But for anyone else, I\u2019d recommend you get a free demo at an Apple Store, marvel at its features and wait and see.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-06T20:43:03Z",
            "content": "Somalia\u2019s president signed a bill on Saturday voiding a preliminary agreement for Somaliland to provide landlocked Ethiopia with port access to Somaliland\u2019s coast, in a largely symbolic move intended to rebuke both parties over a deal that has inflamed tensions across the Horn of Africa. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Saturday Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said the bill was an \u201cillustration of our commitment to safeguard our unity, sovereignty &amp; territorial integrity as per international law\u201d. Somaliland declared independence from Somalia in 1991 amid a civil war in the country\u2019s south and has operated autonomously since. Hargeisa, Somaliland\u2019s capital, claims the borders of the former British protectorate of Somaliland in northern Somalia. The memorandum of understanding, signed between Somaliland\u2019s president, Muse Bihi, and Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, last Monday, outlined the broad sketches of a possible future pact between Addis Ababa and Hargeisa. Though the details of the memorandum remain contested and have not been made public, officials have said Somaliland would grant Ethiopia access to the Gulf of Aden with a naval base, in exchange for shares in Ethiopian Airlines and Ethiopian recognition of Somaliland\u2019s independence from Somalia. In an interview with Ethiopia\u2019s state broadcaster, EBC, Redwan Hussein, security adviser to prime minister Abiy Ahmed, said his country would be granted 20km of land across Somaliland\u2019s Gulf of Aden coast for a period of at least 50 years, with Ethiopia granting Somaliland an equivalent value of shares in Ethiopian Airlines to the land acquired. Senior Somaliland officials have said the memorandum, which at this point isn\u2019t legally binding, would also involve diplomatic recognition for Hargeisa, a long-sought goal for the self-declared republic. Ethiopian officials have given mixed messages on this aspect of the deal, with several making arguments for Somaliland\u2019s recognition, but none committing Ethiopia at this stage. A communique released by Addis Ababa said it would only make an \u201cin-depth assessment\u201d on taking a position on the issue. The deal has faced significant international condemnation and has infuriated Somalia, which has described the move as an act of \u201caggression\u201d. Urging Ethiopia and Somaliland to reverse course, Somalia\u2019s president said a \u201cSomali territory cannot be exchanged for a [share] in a company like Ethiopian Airlines, Ethiopian Telecom, GERD \u2026 even if you combine them we cannot swap for a territory\u201d. Somalia also recalled its ambassador from Ethiopia and has appealed to the international community for support. The US state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, told reporters at a press conference on Wednesday that the US, a significant aid and security partner of Somaliland and Somalia, recognises Somalia within its 1960 borders, which include Somaliland, and called on all parties to resolve their issues through dialogue. On Thursday, the UK released a statement calling for \u201cfull respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d, urging \u201crestraint and dialogue\u201d to resolve issues. The spokesperson for Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry also expressed its support for the \u201cunity, sovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d of Somalia. The EU, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and Arab League have also made appeals to Ethiopia not to proceed with the deal, which has further increased tensions in an already volatile region. Somaliland appears undeterred by the pushback from Mogadishu, saying it would go ahead with a preliminary pact it agreed with Ethiopia. The deal has divided public opinion across Somalia and Somaliland, sparking several demonstrations and counter-demonstrations against the handover of territory to Ethiopia, with which Somalia has a history of conflict."

            "content": "Ethiopia has signed a deal granting it naval and commercial access to ports along Somaliland\u2019s coast, in exchange for recognition for the breakaway republic\u2019s independence, it has been announced. The Somali government, which has long held that Somaliland remains a part of the country, announced that it would convene an emergency meeting of its cabinet in response to the memorandum of understanding, according to state news agency Sonna. Speaking at the press conference in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, after his meeting with the country\u2019s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, Somaliland\u2019s president, Muse Bihi, said: \u201cWe are pleased to announce, and want to express gratitude to the prime minister, and Ethiopia, according to our agreement written here, that we will give 20km of sea and they will recognise us.\u201d On X, formerly Twitter, Somaliland\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs said that the agreement was for a 50-year access lease. Ali Hassan Mohamed, Somaliland\u2019s information minister, described the deal as a \u201cgamechanger\u201d, reiterating his government\u2019s view that the deal involved 20km (12 miles) of sea access in exchange for diplomatic recognition. In a statement published on X Abiy\u2019s office welcomed the agreement but made no mention of recognition of Somaliland, only committing to \u201cadvance mutual interests through cooperation on the basis of reciprocity\u201d. It added: \u201cThe memorandum of understanding shall pave the way to realize the aspiration to secure access to the sea and diversify its access to sea ports,\u201d ushering in a \u201cnew chapter of cooperation\u201d and \u201cregional integration in the Horn\u201d. Redwan Hussein, an adviser to Abiy Ahmed, said the deal was a \u201cstep ahead in the right direction for this and generations to come\u201d, adding that details of the memorandum would be formalised in a follow-up meeting in a month. The meeting between Ethiopia and Somaliland came days after Somalia and Somaliland announced a breakthrough in talks in Djibouti, committing to further dialogue between their respective capitals. Abdikarim Hussein Guled, Somalia\u2019s special envoy to Somaliland, said the deal constituted a \u201cblatant disregard for international norms\u201d by Ethiopia and undermines progress made between Hargeisa and Mogadishu. Somalia\u2019s former president Mohamed Farmaajo posted on X: \u201cThe agreement signed by Ethiopia with Somaliland today is a serious concern for Somalia and the whole of Africa.\u201d Somaliland declared independence from Somalia in the early 1990s, when Somalia had descended into a protracted civil war. Hargeisa, Somaliland\u2019s capital, has been actively seeking international recognition for more than three decades, within the borders of the former British protectorate. Formal recognition by Ethiopia would present Somaliland with its biggest opportunity yet to begin overcoming its international isolation. Ethiopia lost access to its Red Sea ports in the early 1990s when Eritrean insurgents in the country\u2019s north gained control of Ethiopia\u2019s northern coastal region \u2013 which was a former Italian colony \u2013 and then declared independence. Ethiopia is heavily reliant on Djibouti for international trade, with more than 95% passing through the Addis-Djibouti corridor, a vulnerability it has sought to mitigate by diversifying its options. Ethiopia has been signalling its interest in acquiring access to ports along east Africa\u2019s seaboard since October, and said it would assert its rights, raising concern among its neighbours. In a televised address, Abiy said Ethiopia should have a say in the use of the Red Sea ports of its coastal neighbours, just as countries downstream along the Nile River have been allowed to negotiate use of the river that Ethiopia has built a dam across to generate power. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 January 2024 to add further detail about the memorandum of understanding."

            "date": "2024-01-26T14:57:51Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak will cut taxes twice more before the election in an attempt to turn around the party\u2019s position in the polls, the chair of the Conservatives has suggested. Richard Holden, who took on the job in the autumn, said more tax cuts were likely in the March budget and voters could expect another cut after that as well. He made the comments in an interview with GB News as the 2 percentage-point cut in national insurance kicked in this month. \u201cWhat we are now in is a situation where we are coming out of that very tough period and we\u2019re able to outline our plans for the future,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think the actual tax cut, you mentioned the national insurance cut for working people is the start of that. We\u2019ll see more of that in March, and more of that later in the year as well. We have that new direction of travel, which is clear.\u201d Holden\u2019s remarks are the clearest statement that tax cuts will happen, despite recent forecasts suggesting that Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, may have less leeway than previously thought. Experts had forecast headroom of \u00a320bn but the Financial Times reported that Treasury forecasts suggested he had closer to \u00a314bn for cutting taxes. Hunt has previously hinted that tax cuts are the \u201cdirection of travel we would like to go in\u201d but said it was too early to say what he was going to do. In the GB News interview, Holden also said the Conservatives would consider an application from Nigel Farage to join the party. Farage was a Conservative many decades ago but has long been a political enemy as the leader of Ukip, the Brexit party and then the co-founder of Reform. Asked whether he wanted Farage to join the party, in light of polling that showed Reform could be a threat to the Tories\u2019 electoral performance, Holden said: \u201cPolls bounce around. Any application will be considered on its merits.\u201d He played down current polls showing the Tories trailing Labour by 20 points or more, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s quite understandable that between elections polls move around an awful lot.\u201d Holden did not rule out reappointing the former deputy chair Lee Anderson, who quit this month over Sunak\u2019s Rwanda plan. Anderson has since been hinting he would like his old job back and said he regretted abstaining on the bill. The party chair said: \u201cIt was sad to lose Lee. He does a lot of good for the party, fundraisers around the country. Really helping gee up the membership. I hope he continues to do that. \u201cBut the decisions on jobs for people are not one for me alone. I\u2019ll have to chat to the chief whip and prime minister about it. But I think in the long term, you shouldn\u2019t rule anything out. And in fairness to Lee, he was very decent and straightforward in his resignation letter.\u201d"

            "content": "A total of 44 of the 50 US states worsen inequality by making the wealthy pay a lesser share of their income in taxes than lower income people, a new analysis has found. State and local tax regimes are \u201cupside-down\u201d, the new research finds, with weak or non-existent personal income taxes in many states allowing richer Americans to avoid tax. A reliance on sales and excise taxes, considered regressive because they disproportionately impact the poor, has helped fuel this inequality, according to the report. \u201cWhen you ask people what they think a fair tax code looks like, almost nobody says we should have the richest pay the least,\u201d said Carl Davis, research director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), which conducted the analysis. \u201cAnd yet when we look around the country, the vast majority of states have tax systems that do just that. There\u2019s an alarming gap here between what the public wants and what state lawmakers have delivered.\u201d Only six states, plus the District of Columbia, have tax systems that reduce inequality rather than worsen it, with the poorest fifth of people paying a tax rate 60% higher, on average, than the top 1% of households. The super-wealthy are treated particularly lightly by the tax system, with the top 1% paying less than every other income group across 42 states. In most states, 36 in all, the poorest residents are taxed at a higher rate than any other group. The most regressive states in terms of taxation are, in order, Florida, Washington, Tennessee, Pennsylvania and Nevada. The least regressive jurisdictions are DC, Minnesota, Vermont, New York and California. Various state-level policies, such as cutting taxes on the wealthy to supposedly drive economic activity, has worsened this situation, the report found. Inequality in recent decades has been far starker in the US than in other comparable countries and while some pandemic-era interventions, such as increased child tax credit, lessened the burden on the poorest in society, many of those measures have now lapsed. \u201cBut we know it doesn\u2019t have to be like this,\u201d said Aidan Davis, ITEP\u2019s state policy director. \u201cThere is a clear path forward for flipping upside-down tax systems and we\u2019ve seen a handful of states come pretty close to pulling it off. The regressive state tax laws we see today are a policy choice, and it\u2019s clear there are better choices available to lawmakers.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 and 12 January 2024. Owing to incorrect information supplied to us, an earlier version listed New Jersey as the fifth least regressive tax jurisdiction, according to the ITEP report, rather than California. Also, child tax credit was increased during the pandemic, not introduced then as an earlier version said."

            "date": "2024-01-07T13:05:53Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak has said he wants to cut taxes for working people further this year, possibly cutting welfare payments to fund it. The prime minister said on Sunday his priority before the budget in March would be further tax cuts, which he said would entail stricter controls on public spending and benefits. His comments set up the possibility of an income tax cut in March, what is likely to be the last major tax decision by the chancellor before the general election. Sunak told the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg: \u201cMy priority going forward \u2013 which the chancellor also reiterated at the weekend \u2013 our joint priority for the country is to make sure that we control spending, control welfare so that we can cut people\u2019s taxes.\u201d He said he wanted to oversee \u201cdiscipline\u201d in both public sector pay and benefits payments, singling out long-term disability payments as one area for savings. \u201cIt\u2019s about making sure that everybody who can work does work,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for everyone who was working hard, we reward that hard work with tax cuts. That is a Conservative approach, is one that I think is right for our country.\u201d Separately, he told the Sunday Telegraph: \u201cWhen I say that I want to keep cutting taxes, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to deliver. We\u2019re going to do that responsibly. That requires difficult decisions on public spending. It requires difficult decisions to control welfare.\u201d His comments will delight some Conservative backbenchers who have been clamouring for pre-election tax cuts as a way to close the significant poll gap with Labour. However, the prime minister\u2019s focus on pay for working people may disappoint those who have been calling for him to use any spare money to cut inheritance tax instead. They also contrast with the message given on Saturday by his chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, that he \u201cdid not know\u201d whether he would be able to afford further tax cuts this year. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, also said he would want to reduce taxes on working people as soon as possible, but accused the prime minister of prioritising immediate cuts over economic growth. \u201cIt\u2019s not part of a strategy for growing the economy,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cIt\u2019s simply picking tax cuts that the prime minister thinks might create a dividing line going into the election.\u201d Sunak talked in particular of his desire to have fewer people claiming benefits for being unable to work because of long-term sickness or disability. Hunt announced at his autumn statement in November that hundreds of thousands of people would have to look for work they could do from home or face having their benefits cut by nearly \u00a35,000 a year. That prompted accusations from disability charities that the government was punishing disabled people and adding anxiety to households that were already struggling. But on Sunday the prime minister defended the cuts, saying they were part of a wider plan to significantly reduce the number of people claiming those benefits. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the number of people who are signed off has tripled,\u201d he said. \u201cSo do I think our country is three times sicker than it was a decade ago? The answer is no. That the system is not working as it was designed to work.\u201d MPs return to Westminster on Monday with the prime minister facing criticism on several fronts and a series of potentially damaging byelections within weeks. On Friday the former Tory minister Chris Skidmore said he would quit as an MP in protest at the government\u2019s plans to issue more oil and gas licences in the North Sea, triggering a byelection in his Kingswood seat. There will be another in Wellingborough after voters recalled the sitting Tory MP, who was found to have bullied and harassed a member of staff. A third could take place in Blackpool South, where the Conservative MP Scott Benton is fighting a lengthy suspension from parliament after being found to have breached lobbying rules. Some Tory MPs want the prime minister to take a more aggressive stance on a range of issues before what he said last week would be an election in the second half of the year. As well as significant tax cuts, many in his party want to toughen up his bill to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda before it comes back to the Commons for another vote. Sunak urged his colleagues and voters on Sunday to stay the course, however. \u201cThe choice now is to stick to the plan, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do because the plan will deliver the long-term change that our country needs,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cI feel upbeat because of the progress we\u2019ve made. And the fact that I know we\u2019re now pointing in the right direction.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-28T10:53:14Z",
            "content": "UK politics is stuck in a holding pattern. Ever since Liz Truss\u2019s seven-week stint as prime minister, opinion polls have been consistent: the Conservatives are on course for a thumping defeat. Historical precedent suggests the race should get tighter as the election approaches but there is currently no evidence of that happening. In fact, Labour\u2019s lead seems to be getting bigger. What is worrying for the government is that its political plight seems to be getting worse even though the economic news has been getting modestly better. The big development in recent months has been the sharp fall in inflation, which has had two significant knock-on effects: it has reduced interest payments on the national debt and led to mortgage lenders reducing home loan rates in anticipation of lower interest rates from the Bank of England. The first has provided Jeremy Hunt with some extra budget wriggle room; the second has already started to lead to a gentle revival in housing market activity. Have voters noticed? If they have, there is scant evidence that they give the Conservatives any credit. As a result, the idea of an early election \u2013 which was being toyed with a couple of months back \u2013 has been ditched. The chancellor has not yet abandoned all hope of victory but wants the election delayed until the autumn, by which time the Bank should have started to cut interest rates and the effects of tax cuts will have be showing up in pay packets for several months. There is even talk of squeezing in another package of tax cuts in the autumn, which really would be a desperate last roll of the dice. In reality, the Conservatives are now looking at damage limitation rather than victory \u2013 and even that will require not just tax cuts but also significant reductions in interest rates. This Thursday the Bank will provide its quarterly assessment of the state of the economy and announce its latest decision on interest rates. It is a stone-cold certainty that official borrowing costs will be left at 5.25% but of more interest will be Threadneedle Street\u2019s steer on what happens next. In its November 2023 health check, the Bank stressed that interest rates were likely to remain high for an extended period and might need to rise if there was evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures. The best judgment of its nine-strong monetary policy committee was that inflation would not return to its 2% target until the end of 2025. In the light of subsequent events, that now looks far too pessimistic. Analysts at the consultancy Capital Economics think tumbling energy prices will bring the annual inflation rate down from 4% now to 1.8% in April and to just 0.9% in September. If the Capital Economics forecasts are anywhere near correct, the Bank will soon come under strong pressure to cut interest rates, pressure that it is likely to resist for only so long. There is sure to be a softening of its stance on Thursday, with talk of further rate rises dropped and perhaps an indication of cuts, provided the fall in inflation is sustained. For now, the MPC is likely to take a cautious approach. It will point out that the labour market remains tight and that core inflation \u2013 which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco \u2013 is still above 5%. The Bank will be monitoring pay settlements closely as the 2024 pay round gets under way. It is also likely to warn that financial markets are getting carried away in expecting four quarter-point cuts this year and that there is a risk that the sort of rapid and aggressive easing of policy currently expected by the City might lead to inflation being above its 2% target in 2026. But rates have peaked at 5.25% and the next move will be down. Threadneedle Street will be interested to see what Hunt decides to do in his budget on 6 March but you don\u2019t need a crystal ball to work out what is going to happen. Frankly, it is not a question of whether or not the chancellor cuts personal taxes because that decision \u2013 as he made clear in comments made in Davos earlier this month \u2013 has already been taken. The real issue is by how much he cuts them, and the signs are that he might have about \u00a320bn to play with. That\u2019s not to say cutting income tax and again freezing fuel duty for motorists is the best use of \u00a320bn. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out last week, there is a high risk that any tax cuts now will be paid for by tax rises or spending cuts after the election. It is certainly not hard to think of better uses for a \u00a320bn windfall. Current Treasury plans involve a \u00a320bn cut in public investment by 2028-29, which Hunt could reverse if he chose to do so. That would boost long-term growth potential rather than consumer spending. Alternatively, he could spend the money on repairing the UK\u2019s threadbare welfare safety net. In a report released last week, Donald Hirsch, an emeritus professor of social policy at Loughborough University, said the system was failing to meet the most basic needs, concluding: \u201cToday, we do not have a safety net worth its name.\u201d That\u2019s a disgrace but only someone not really paying attention would imagine that the last budget before an election is going to be devoted to making the social safety net fit for purpose. Governments facing a wipeout will always find a way to cut taxes even if the chances of them having a material impact on the election \u2013 as in this case \u2013 are vanishingly small."

            "content": "It used to be said that, in their myopia, British voters wanted European levels of public service provision on American levels of taxation. But the recent direction of travel has been towards American levels of public service provision on European levels of taxation. The risk is that tax, as an idea and institution, becomes unmoored in Britain from any lingering social democratic optimism, instead becoming another symptom of national decline. Against this background, Britain has entered an election year in an unusual position: outside Scotland and Wales, whose devolved governments have limited room for fiscal manoeuvre, all the major political parties are arguing that taxes have risen too high. This isn\u2019t quite the same thing as promising tax cuts, although Jeremy Hunt has made it clear that his spring budget on 6 March will include some of those. Pressure to reduce the overall level of taxation has been an unrelenting feature of internal Conservative party politics over the course of this parliament, resulting in the surreal rupture of the 45-day Liz Truss premiership, before building up all over again under Rishi Sunak. Labour and the Liberal Democrats take every opportunity to remind voters that taxes on working people are hurting them. When Boris Johnson triumphed at the 2019 election on the promise to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, Britain could still consider itself a low-tax economy, relative to the OECD average. Its tax rate is now above that average. This parliament will see the sharpest rise in taxation as a proportion of GDP since official data on tax revenues began, the result being that taxation is now at its highest sustained level (37% of GDP) on record. The reasons for this unprecedented rise are well rehearsed. Covid-19 placed unprecedented strain on the NHS and demands on the public balance sheet that are ordinarily only encountered during wartime. The number of people claiming disability benefit since 2020 has soared, doubling in the year to July 2022 alone, driven especially by mental health conditions among children and young people. To this we can add the symptoms of long-term economic decline: stagnant productivity and wage growth, minimal GDP growth, an ageing population, and a class of high net-worth elites whose primary objective is to insulate family wealth from risk-taking and taxation. Various taxes have risen to accommodate these crises, but the most significant (accounting for a third of the overall increase) and controversial has been the freezing of income tax bands. In 2021, the government announced that the points at which workers would be charged different marginal tax rates would be frozen for four years (later extended to six years), meaning that inflation would drag a rising share of the workforce into higher bands. With nominal wages rising significantly over the past two years, even when they\u2019ve fallen in real terms because of inflation, this has been a painful experience for many people. Young graduates are now the most highly taxed workers in Britain, thanks to the additional 9% levy on their incomes that is charged to pay off their student \u201cloans\u201d. Aside from its material impact on working people, this state of affairs has had profound implications for the politics and ideologies that surround tax in the UK. None of the reasons for this rising tax burden are things that anyone would choose or celebrate, but instead reflect the unhappy condition of Britain today. More than any comparator nation, the UK remains weighed down by the legacies of its twin 21st-century crises, financial and health. And the principal means by which this additional revenue has been collected \u2013 allowing people to drift into higher tax bands \u2013 has never been politically argued for or justified. Instead, like the proverbial frog in heating water, a new fiscal settlement has crept up on us. Hunt\u2019s desperate attempts to portray himself as a tax-cutter akin to Nigel Lawson will win a couple of headlines in sympathetic papers, but won\u2019t change the underlying reality. When an economy scarcely grows but the demands on the state escalate sharply, something has to give. This has been deeply disorientating for the Conservative party. At least in theory, the Truss programme offered a route out of this fiscal bind, seeking to stimulate growth through sudden supply-side tax cuts, until eventually tax revenues rose. We know how that ended. No doubt there is an even more libertarian wing of the Conservative party, not to mention its allied thinktanks and donors, that would respond to the impasse by significantly shrinking the state\u2019s commitments to sick and disabled people. But beating up on the NHS is not a realistic electoral strategy for the Tories, who are in effect now the English pensioners\u2019 party. For Labour, the diffuse sense of tax as a weight around voters\u2019 necks is even more ideologically challenging. New Labour was famously coy about proclaiming the argument in favour of taxation, but nevertheless it did happen. The 1997 \u201cwindfall tax\u201d on privatised utilities was earmarked to pay for the \u201cnew deal\u201d to tackle long-term unemployment. To great fanfare in 2002, Gordon Brown announced a 1% rise in national insurance to go directly to the NHS. And in 2010, in the fiscal wreckage left by the banking crisis, Labour introduced a new 50p income tax rate. The left always pushed for more, but the sense that taxation was the path to social justice and prosperity was one the party felt broadly comfortable with. The worry today must be that that equivalence between taxation and collective progress has broken down, not least in the minds of those young, liberal-minded graduates who are now Labour\u2019s core vote. It is one thing to announce a tax rise that translates into sparkling new maternity wards or training programmes. It is another to announce one that simply clears some of the backlog of years of public service failures, or helps prop up a stagnant economy. Even so, despite arguing that taxes on working people are too high, Keir Starmer has refused to commit to unfreezing the income tax thresholds, while Rachel Reeves has ruled out tax increases on the rich, including wealth taxes. In which case, whatever the outcome of the 2024 general election, it looks as if the new fiscal status quo, that nobody chose, is here to stay.

            "date": "2024-01-14T15:06:28Z",
            "content": "Oxford is launching an electric fleet that will make the city one of the UK\u2019s leading adopters of zero-emission buses. The 159 new battery-powered buses will give Oxford more electric buses per capita than other cities including London, Glasgow and Leicester, under a pioneering arrangement in which the council will guarantee private operators faster journey times in return for investment. From Monday, the first buses will officially enter service after a ceremony to mark the launch. Only buses that are zero-emission will be allowed within the city when the entire fleet is operational, with more restrictions on other types of traffic to cut congestion as well as improve air quality. Just over half the money for the \u00a382.5m scheme has come from Go-Ahead and Stagecoach, who put in \u00a343.7m to buy the vehicles, with the rest from the council and government. Oxfordshire county council received a \u00a332.8m grant from the Department for Transport\u2019s \u00a3500m Zebra scheme to fund zero-emission buses. The partnership, in which both Go-Ahead and Stagecoach electric buses will be rebranded in the same livery, will be underpinned by further traffic measures in the city to reduce bus journey times by at least 10% compared with 2019 speeds \u2013 a contractual commitment from the council to ensure the investment is viable for the private companies. The city already has a number of \u201cbus gates\u201d, which prohibit most other vehicles, and more traffic filters will be introduced by the end of 2024 to push people towards public transport or active travel where possible. Oxford has already implemented several low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), which have been the focus of heated protests by campaigners and conspiracy theorists. So far, increased traffic on the edge of LTNs has slightly slowed bus speeds in the city, according to Luke Marion, managing director of the Go-Ahead-owned Oxford Bus Company, who said the company nevertheless supports the zones as a \u201ckey part of the jigsaw\u201d. Accompanying measures to cut traffic had been delayed, partly because of major roadworks, he said, but \u201conce the traffic filters come in, that will cease to be such a problem.\u201d Oxford Bus Company, which will provide 104 of the 159 mostly double-decker electric buses, has installed a charging hub at its Cowley House depot that provides enough electricity to charge its entire fleet to drive 170 miles daily. The first of its electric buses, serving Oxford Brookes University, are already on the roads but Marion described Monday\u2019s launch as a \u201chistoric moment in our journey towards transforming our city services to electric\u201d. There are 2,776 battery-operated buses in service in the UK, according to Zemo, a zero-emissions transport body, with more than 1,400 in London and nearly 500 in Scotland. The Oxford launch comes just as Go-Ahead has been forced to temporarily withdraw a small fleet of electric buses in south London after one caught fire on Thursday. Transport for London said the move was a precaution affecting only one model serving a particular route. The move to make all Oxford buses zero-emission comes in contrast to the controversial decision to build the new East-West railway line between Oxford and Cambridge using diesel trains, rather than electrifying the track."

            "date": "2024-01-12T08:04:05Z",
            "content": "Soldiers and police patrolled Port Moresby on Friday a day after Papua New Guinea declared a state of emergency in the capital in response to rioting and other violence in which at least 16 people are reported to have died. The prime minister, James Marape, declared a 14-day state of emergency, suspending several officials and putting more than 1,000 soldiers on standby, after a police and public sector protest over pay on Wednesday descended into rioting and looting. The city had returned to a \u201cnew normal\u201d on Friday morning, with police and soldiers on the streets and long lines at petrol stations, according to Matt Cannon, who heads the local branch of not-for-profit emergency responder service St John Ambulance. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting the supermarkets that are functioning to reopen today and I\u2019m hearing they have increased security to cater for potentially large numbers of people,\u201d Cannon said. Police and other public servants went on strike on Wednesday over a pay cut that officials later blamed on an administrative error. Within hours, thousands thronged the streets, looting and rioting against a backdrop of smoke and burning buildings. A mob also tried to break through the gates outside the prime minister\u2019s office. On Friday, Marape faced a number of calls to resign, including from former prime minister Peter O\u2019Neill. \u201cI \u2026 am still reeling from the shocking scenes of destruction that gripped Port Moresby,\u201d O\u2019Neill said in a statement, calling it the darkest day in the country\u2019s history. \u201cThere is no shame in taking responsibility, but it is absolutely shameful to continue knowing you have lost command and control,\u201d he added, referring to Marape. Nine people were killed in the rioting in capital city and seven were killed in Lae, in the country\u2019s north, the Australian national broadcaster ABC reported on Thursday, citing police. Four of those killed were reportedly shot by a business owner in a suburb of the capital. More than 50 people were being treated for injuries at Port Moresby general hospital, according to a statement. Among them were a number of gunshot and knife wounds. The finance secretary and police commissioner were among the officials suspended by the prime minister. In a statement, Marape that the decision to suspend them for 14 days \u201cin no way indicates their involvement in matters of concern\u201d. Australia\u2019s defence minister, Richard Marles, said on Friday the situation in the country had improved and that the Papua New Guinea government had issued some small requests for assistance from Canberra. Things were quiet on Friday when Eddie Allo took the bus to his work at the Port Moresby general hospital. Most vehicles on the roads were government-owned and many people were short on fuel because petrol stations had been closed, he said. \u201cEverything is at a standstill now,\u201d Allo said by phone. \u201cNot many people are on the street and the police and army are patrolling around the areas on foot. No looting is going on.\u201d Rebecca Kuku is a reporter with The National, based in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. With Reuters"

            "title": "Perth overtakes east coast to become Australia\u2019s hottest capital city property market",
            "date": "2024-01-06T19:00:01Z",
            "content": "The Australian property boom has shifted from east to west, with buyers and renters tussling for a limited number of Perth homes and creating a housing crisis for those left behind. Perth has become the hottest selling market among state capitals, with homes listed for a median 11 days before being sold, according to CoreLogic data calculated for Guardian Australia. That was 10 days less than the next fastest-selling state capital \u2013 Brisbane \u2013 highlighting the gulf between Perth and the rest of the country. CoreLogic\u2019s research director, Tim Lawless, said buyers were probably feeling a sense of urgency given they had little choice or ability to negotiate in Perth. \u201cThe figures indicate a housing market that is skewed well towards sellers rather than buyers,\u201d Lawless said. Across all state capitals in the December quarter, the median number of days that properties spent on the market was 27. Renters in the Western Australian capital were also under intense pressure, with Perth tenants now entering their fourth consecutive year of historically low stock, which has been pushing rents higher. Perth has the tightest capital city rental market in the country, with vacancies at 0.4%, according to SQM Research. Mandy Dehnel, who supports a team of financial counsellors at The Salvation Army, said the crisis was so extreme that even people with good incomes were struggling to find suitable housing. \u201cThere are horror stories of rentals which aren\u2019t really rentals because they are more like overcrowded boarding situations,\u201d said Dehnel, the Moneycare manager for Western Australia. \u201cPeople are also too afraid to make complaints in case it puts their tenancy at risk.\u201d The tightness in the Perth property market, which is also evident in regional areas, comes after a relatively subdued period when price growth failed to keep pace with the sharp rises recorded in other major cities, led by Sydney and Melbourne. As a result, housing construction in Perth was subdued for several years, creating a sharp supply and demand imbalance. This has been exacerbated by strong population growth and a mining sector that is expanding well beyond its iron ore and gold base to other labour-intensive projects, including lithium mines. Dehnel said one Perth tenant was told a week before Christmas her rent would be increased by $100 a week, a 20% increase. \u201cPeople are delaying medical and dental appointments because it is something they can put off, but it has such a long term impact on their health,\u201d she said. The state Labor government has set up a new housing unit designed to boost supply, which is scheduled to become operational this month. The initiative sits in the government\u2019s treasury department, a sign of the significance of the housing crisis. The government has also said it is investing record amounts in social housing and homelessness measures. While large parts of Australia have been grappling with a housing crunch for years, some of the intensity has seeped out of the east coast market. This is linked to the lagged effect of rising mortgage rates, which are now starting to bite, according to AMP. The impact of higher rates is showing up in recent price falls in Melbourne and a slowdown in gains in Sydney. The investment group believes the Sydney and Melbourne markets are more at risk of a price pullback but other cities \u2013 including Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide \u2013 are likely to remain strong. The main risks to property prices are rising unemployment levels, increasing mortgage rates and an unforeseen global event, such as a banking or debt crisis, according to investment property managers. But a lack of supply means there is little relief for tenants on the horizon. Perth-based property valuer Gavin Hegney said investor funds were marching confidently across the Nullarbor, pushing up prices. \u201cIt\u2019s a boom, there\u2019s no other way to put it, and eastern state investors have been really active in Perth,\u201d Hegney said. \u201cThere\u2019s an undersupply of dwellings relative to the population growth, but the response time is just too slow.\u201d He said the situation was so bad that an \u201cemergency measure\u201d should be deployed, such as allowing homeowners to rent out rooms with no negative tax consequences."

The Guardian\u2019s Emma Graham-Harrison and Toby Helm report: Defiant Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu doubled down on opposition to Palestinian statehood, deepening the divide with Israel\u2019s closest international allies, as cracks in his wartime \u201cunity\u201d government became increasingly evident. Anger with Netanyahu is also increasingly visible on the streets, even though there is broad public support for the war. On Saturday, protesters gathered in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Caesarea and Kfar Saba, some calling for bolder action to secure the release of hostages, and others demanding the prime minister step down. One in Jerusalem held a placard that read: \u201cMothers\u2019 cry: we will not sacrifice our children in the war to save the rightwing.\u201d Over the weekend, Netanyahu sparred publicly \u2013 if indirectly \u2013 with US President Joe Biden, who for months has offered Israel almost unconditional support for its war in Gaza, at considerable political cost to his own administration, both in America and beyond. For the full story, click here: Three in four Palestinians in Gaza are internally displaced as a result of Israel\u2019s strikes across the strip, the World Health Organization announced on Saturday.

We are sleeping on the ground using only this sheet. Every day, early morning we head out to get water and it\u2019s not enough. We haven\u2019t had water since yesterday. My little girl is sick since the day we arrived here because of wastewater that\u2019s all around us. At least a dozen missiles were filed at a military base used by US-led coalition forces in Iraq on Saturday. Reuters reports: \u201cAl-Asad airbase was targeted by 15 rockets\u201d fired from Anbar province, which is home to the military base, an Iraqi police official from the region told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said 13 of the projectiles were shot down by anti-air defences but that \u201ctwo fell on the airbase.\u201d A US defence official, who also requested anonymity, confirmed that \u201cmissiles impacted Al-Asad airbase\u201d, adding that a joint damage assessment was under way with coalition and Iraqi forces.

Joe Biden said a two-state solution is still possible after a call with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who previously publicly said that he rejects a Palestinian state. The Guardian\u2019s Jason Burke reports: Joe Biden has said the creation of an independent state for Palestinians was still possible while Benjamin Netanyahu was still in office, following a call with the Israeli prime minister on Friday. The US president spoke to Netanyahu for the first time in nearly a month about differences over a future Palestinian state, as well as Israel\u2019s ongoing offensive in Gaza, where the Palestinian death toll is approaching 25,000, according to local health authorities. Early on Saturday, witnesses reported further Israeli bombardment on Khan Younis, the largest city in Gaza\u2019s south, although Palestinian media also reported intense fire around Jabalia in the north. The leaders\u2019 call came a day after Netanyahu said in a televised press conference in Israel that he had told US officials in plain terms that he will not support a Palestinian state as part of any postwar plan. For the full story, click here: Unicef communication specialist Tess Ingram has released a dispatch from Gaza, saying: \u201cHumanity cannot allow this warped version of normal to persist any longer.\u201d Speaking from the Emirati hospital in Gaza, Ingram said: The situation is very desperate.

Two mothers are killed every hour, the UN estimates, as Israeli strikes continue to destroy the Gaza strip, leaving nearly 2 million Palestinians displaced. US personnel suffered minor injuries and a member of Iraq\u2019s security forces was seriously wounded after an attack on Iraq\u2019s Ain al-Asad airbase on Saturday, Reuters reports a US official saying. Speaking anonymously, the official said that initial reports indicated that the base was struck by ballistic missiles but left open the possibility that it may have been hit by rockets. A fifth member of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards has been killed in an Israeli missile strike in Syria on Saturday, Reuters reports. According to a Revolutionary Guards statement, Amin Samadi \u201cfell as a martyr after being among those wounded in today\u2019s Zionist terrorist crime in Damascus\u201d. Earlier on Saturday, the Revolutionary Guards confirmed that four guards were killed in the attack. The Palestine Red Crescent Society teams helped evacuate five critically injured individuals from al-Shifa hospital to the European hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza on Saturday. In a post on X, the PRCS added that seven more individuals were transported from Gaza City to the Rafah crossing to reunite with their families on the Egyptian side. It is 6.05pm in Gaza City, Beirut and Tel Aviv, 7.05pm in Damascus and 7.35pm in Tehran. Here are the updates so far on Saturday: Iran has condemned a missile strike that killed four members of its Revolutionary Guards in Damascus, Syria, on Saturday as a \u201cdesperate attempt to spread instability in region\u201d. Iran has blamed Israel for the attack but there was no immediate comment from Israel. Foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said Iran \u201cresreserves its right to respond\u201d. Several members of Syrian armed forces were also killed in the airstrike on the Mazzeh neighbourhood. Senior Hamas official, Izzat al-Rishq on Saturday dismissed comments by the US president, Joe Biden, about the possibility of Israel agreeing to the establishment of a Palestinian state, reports AFP. \u201cBiden is a full partner in the genocidal war and our people do not expect any good from him,\u201d he said. It comes after Biden and Netanyahu held their first call since 23 December and discussed a postwar future for Palestinians which have suggested a rift between the two allies. Israel\u2019s president, Benjamin Netanyahu, has appeared to push back against US president Joe Biden\u2019s remarks about Palestinian statehood after the war against Hamas in Gaza ends in a statement published by his office on Saturday. Asked to clarify whether Netanyahu was opposed to any kind of Palestinian statehood, his office did not immediately respond. An Israeli strike on southern Lebanon on Saturday killed two members of the Palestinian militant group Hamas as they were traveling in a car, three security sources in Lebanon told Reuters. Iran\u2019s IRGC commanders and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah group are on the ground in Yemen helping to direct and oversee Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping, four regional and two Iranian sources told Reuters. Kanaani had repeatedly denied Tehran is involved in the Red Sea attacks by the Houthis, while the Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam denied any Iranian or Hezbollah involvement in helping to direct the Red Sea attacks. Israel pounded targets across the Gaza Strip on Saturday while its planes dropped leaflets on the southern area of Rafah urging Palestinians seeking refuge there to help locate hostages held by Hamas. Palestinian fighters battled tanks trying to push back into the eastern suburbs of the Jabalia area in northern Gaza, where Israel had started pulling out troops and shifting to smaller-scale operations. In the southern area of Khan Younis, where Israel says it has expanded its operations against Hamas, witnesses said tanks shelled areas around Nasser hospital overnight, describing the bombardment as the most intense in many days. The Israeli military said that in Khan Younis, it raided a military compound, neutralised ready-to-use rocket launchers and found explosives stashed underground while an aircraft struck two gunmen there. Dozens of protesters gathered outside the residence of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Friday night, calling for the immediate release of all hostages kidnapped during the Hamas attack on 7 October. At least 22 Palestinians, including a woman and children, were arrested overnight in occupied West Bank by Israeli forces. The Palestinian Prisoners Club said the arrests were carried out in Hebron, Nablus, Tubas, Bethlehem, Jenin and Jerusalem. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has said the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza \u201cremains dire\u201d, with people returning to \u201cprimitive methods for food preparation and general hygiene\u201d. It also said the situation had been \u201cexacerbated by the continuous Israeli blockade hindering aid delivery\u201d. Two Palestinians were killed and several others injured in an Israeli bombing of the al-Amal neighbourhood in the city of Khan Younis, bringing the number of victims of shelling in several areas in the city since dawn on Friday to 18 dead and dozens wounded. The Cyprus government is facing growing criticism over British military bases on the island being used by UK and US forces to stage airstrikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The UK\u2019s shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, has described Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state when the war in Gaza ends as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. In an interview with BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Saturday, he said: \u201cWe are committed to the recognition of a Palestinian state. We want to work with international partners to achieve that.\u201d Ashraf al-Qudra, the spokesperson for the Hamas-run health ministry in the Gaza Strip, told Al Jazeera that Israel had targeted the healthcare system since the very beginning of the war on 7 October and that aid entering the area \u201cdoes not meet basic health needs\u201d. The latest figures from the Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas, said 165 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes and 280 injured in the past 24 hours. Iran\u2019s foreign ministry condemned a missile strike that killed four members of its Revolutionary Guards in Syria on Saturday as a \u201cdesperate attempt to spread instability in region\u201d, reported Reuters, citing Iranian state media. Iran has blamed Israel for the attack but there was no immediate comment from Israel, reported Reuters. \u201cIran \u2026 reserves its right to respond to the organised terrorism of the fake Zionist regime at the appropriate time and place,\u201d the foreign ministry spokesperson, Nasser Kanaani, was quoted by state media as saying. He also urged foreign countries and international organisations to condemn the attack. AFP reported that Kanaani decried \u201cfrequent violations of Syria\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity and an escalation in aggressive and provocative attacks\u201d by Israel. Iran\u2019s IRGC commanders and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah group are on the ground in Yemen helping to direct and oversee Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping, four regional and two Iranian sources told Reuters. Iran, which has armed, trained and funded the Houthis, stepped up its weapons supplies to the militia as a result of the war in Gaza, which erupted after the Iranian-backed militants Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, the four regional sources said. Tehran has provided advanced drones, anti-ship cruise missiles, precision-strike ballistic missiles and medium-range missiles to the Houthis, who started targeting commercial vessels in November in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, the sources told Reuters. IRGC commanders and advisers are also providing knowhow, data and intelligence support to determine which of the dozens of vessels travelling through the Red Sea each day are destined for Israel and constitute Houthi targets, all the sources said. \u201cThe Revolutionary Guards have been helping the Houthis with military training (on advanced weapons),\u201d an Iranian insider told Reuters. \u201cA group of Houthi fighters were in Iran last month and were trained in an IRGC base in central Iran to get familiar with the new technology and the use of missiles.\u201d The person said Iranian commanders had travelled to Yemen as well and set up a command centre in the capital Sana\u2019a for the Red Sea attacks which is being run by the senior IRGC commander responsible for Yemen.\u201d Washington said last month that Iran was deeply involved in planning operations against shipping in the Red Sea and that its intelligence was critical to enable the Houthis to target ships. In response to a request for comment by Reuters, the White House pointed to its previous public comments about how Iran had been supporting the Houthis. In his weekly news conferences, Iran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson, Nasser Kanaani, had repeatedly denied Tehran is involved in the Red Sea attacks by the Houthis. The IRGC public relations office did not respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment. The Houthi spokesperson, Mohammed Abdulsalam, denied any Iranian or Hezbollah involvement in helping to direct the Red Sea attacks. A Hezbollah spokesperson did not respond to a request by Reuters for comment. Ashraf al-Qudra, the spokesperson for the Hamas-run health ministry in the Gaza Strip, has told Al Jazeera that Israel has targeted the healthcare system since the very beginning of the war on 7 October and that aid entering the area \u201cdoes not meet basic health needs\u201d. \u201cThe aid entering the Gaza Strip does not meet basic health needs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe try to differentiate between cases among the wounded and sick to save who we can.\u201d He added that Israel controls the mechanism for the exit of patients who urgently require medical treatment outside the Gaza Strip. On Friday, Unicef described the Gaza Strip as \u201cthe most dangerous place in the world to be a child\u201d. Its deputy executive director, Ted Chaiban, said in statement released after visiting the area in regards to aid that Unicef was \u201ctrying to drip assistance through a straw to meet an ocean of need\u201d. He said: Before the conflict more than 500 trucks entered the Gaza Strip every day. When I was there in November, about 60 aid trucks a day entered. Now, it is about 130 trucks a day alongside an average of 30 commercial trucks a day. This is with the opening of a second crossing point but it still remains wholly inadequate. We are trying to drip assistance through a straw to meet an ocean of need. The charity ActionAid UK, on Friday criticised the \u201cconfusing and arbitrary rules about the type of aid permitted to enter Gaza\u201d. The charity said this had resulted in thousands of essential items being stopped at border crossings and prevented from reaching those who desperately need it, as well as increasing the time spent on screening trucks, leading to a backlog at the border. Here are the latest images coming across the wires from Gaza and Israel: The Cyprus government is facing growing criticism over British military bases on the island being used by UK and US forces to stage airstrikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. President Nicos Christodoulides has been accused by activists of turning a blind eye to the risks the EU\u2019s most easterly state might confront if the strategic facilities on the island continue to be used in military operations. The Guardian has learned that both the US ambassador and British high commissioner briefed the Cypriot president of imminent military action in Yemen before the first round of airstrikes last week. \u201cThere are ever more war planes taking off every day,\u201d Tassos Costeas, a prominent Greek Cypriot peace activist, said. \u201cThe dangers of Cyprus becoming a target are evident.\u201d The UK\u2019s shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, has described Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state when the war in Gaza ends as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. In an interview with BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Saturday, he echoed Keir Starmer\u2019s reaction to the Israeli prime minister\u2019s stance. Lammy said: \u201cWe are committed to the recognition of a Palestinian state. We want to work with international partners to achieve that.\u201d He said the US president, Joe Biden, was right to have committed to working towards helping the Palestinians move towards statehood. \u201cAnd I have to say, I think Netanyahu\u2019s words were unacceptable,\u201d he added. \u201cOf course, the Palestinian people deserve a state, and if they don\u2019t, the consequence of that is either one state in which Benjamin Netanyahu would have to explain how Palestinians and Israelis live side by-side with equal rights, or no state, in which what he is really saying is occupation, and siege continues.\u201d Read more here. Benjamin Netanyahu has appeared to push back against Joe Biden\u2019s remarks about Palestinian statehood after the war against Hamas in Gaza ends. The US president said on Friday he had spoken with the Israeli prime minister about possible solutions for the creation of an independent Palestinian state, suggesting one path could involve a non-militarised government. A statement from Netanyahu\u2019s office on Saturday said: In his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty. Asked to clarify whether Netanyahu was opposed to any kind of Palestinian statehood, his office did not immediately respond. Biden\u2019s call with Netanyahu was the first in nearly a month, the White House said. Asked if a two-state solution was \u201cimpossible\u201d while Netanyahu was in office, Biden said: \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d He said Netanyahu was not opposed to all two-state solutions, and there were a number of types possible. Netanyahu has stopped short of outright and explicit rejection of Palestinian statehood. But on Thursday he said that in the foreseeable future: With an accord or without an accord, Israel must have security control over the entire territory west of the Jordan River. That\u2019s a necessary condition. It clashes with the principle of sovereignty but what can you do.\u201d US-backed peace talks towards the two-state solution, which would involve Israel existing next to a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, collapsed a decade ago. Relatives of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have protested overnight outside the home of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The protesters said in a statement that after begging the government for 105 days to show leadership, families are now demanding bold steps to free the more than 100 remaining captives, AP reports. In Gaza, residents reported heavy bombardment and fighting between Palestinian militants and Israeli troops around the southern city of Khan Younis and the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya in the territory\u2019s north. Netanyahu is under pressure to appease his rightwing governing coalition by intensifying the war. He also faces growing calls for restraint from the United States and the families of hostages. A senior Hamas official on Saturday dismissed comments by the US president, Joe Biden, about the possibility of Israel agreeing to the establishment of a Palestinian state, reports AFP. On Friday Biden said it was still possible that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, could agree to some form of Palestinian state after the two leaders spoke by phone for the first time in nearly a month. \u201cThe illusion that Biden is preaching about a state of Palestine and its characteristics does not fool our people,\u201d Izzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas\u2019s political bureau, said in a statement. \u201cBiden is a full partner in the genocidal war and our people do not expect any good from him.\u201d Biden said after the call that it was possible that Netanyahu could become open to some form of two-state solution, one of them involving a non-militarised Palestinian government. \u201cThere are a number of types of two-state solutions. There\u2019s a number of countries that are members of the UN that \u2026 don\u2019t have their own militaries,\u201d Biden told reporters after an event at the White House. The call between Biden and Netanyahu came a day after the Israeli leader said he opposes allowing Palestinian sovereignty as the war in Gaza shows no signs of letting up. Israel pounded targets across the Gaza Strip on Saturday while its planes dropped leaflets on the southern area of Rafah urging Palestinians seeking refuge there to help locate hostages held by Hamas, reports Reuters. The leaflets showed photos of 33 hostages, their names written in Arabic, urging the displaced to make contact. \u201cDo you want to return home? Please make the call if you recognise one of them,\u201d the leaflets read. More than 100 of the hostages seized by Hamas were freed during a short-lived November truce. Israel says 132 remain in Gaza, 27 of whom have been killed in captivity. Palestinian fighters battled tanks trying to push back into the eastern suburbs of the Jabalia area in northern Gaza, where Israel had started pulling out troops and shifting to smaller-scale operations, witnesses and militants told Reuters. The Israeli military said aircraft struck militant squads trying to plant explosives near troops and fire missiles at tanks in northern Gaza and said it was striking targets throughout Gaza. In the southern area of Khan Younis, where Israel says it has expanded its operations against Hamas, witnesses said tanks shelled areas around Nasser hospital overnight, describing the bombardment as the most intense in many days. Israel says Hamas fighters operate from in and around hospitals, including Nasser, which Hamas and medical staff deny, though Israel has presented some footage and photos backing its claims. Nasser is the biggest hospital still partly working in Gaza. According to Reuters, the Israeli military said that in Khan Younis, it raided a military compound, neutralised ready-to-use rocket launchers and found explosives stashed underground while an aircraft struck two gunmen there. Here are some of the latest images from Gaza, the West Bank, Israel, Syria and Spain. An Israeli strike on southern Lebanon on Saturday killed two members of the Palestinian militant group Hamas as they were traveling in a car, three security sources in Lebanon told Reuters. Israel has been carrying out airstrikes on southern Lebanon against Palestinian militant groups based there and on their Lebanese ally Hezbollah, a powerful armed group, which have fired rockets across the border at Israel. The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, has described Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state when the war in the Middle East ends as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. In an interview with BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he echoed Keir Starmer\u2019s reaction to Netanyahu\u2019s stance. Lammy said: \u201cWe are committed to the recognition of a Palestinian state. We want to work with international partners to achieve that.\u201d He said the US president, Joe Biden, was right to have committed to working towards helping the Palestinians move towards statehood. At least 22 Palestinians, including a woman and children, were arrested overnight in occupied West Bank by Israeli forces, Al Jazeera reports citing information from the Palestinian Prisoners Club. This brings the total number of arrested Palestinians since 7 October to at least 6,115. The Palestinian Prisoners Club, which represents former and current prisoners, said the arrests were carried out in Hebron, Nablus, Tubas, Bethlehem, Jenin and Jerusalem and \u201cwere accompanied by widespread raids and abuse, in addition to widespread sabotage and destruction of citizens\u2019 homes, the destruction of infrastructure, and the confiscation of money and vehicles\u201d. Dozens of protesters gathered outside the residence of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Friday night, calling for the immediate release of all hostages kidnapped during the Hamas attack on 7 October, reports Israel\u2019s left-leaning daily newspaper, Haaretz. Protesters stood or sat in silence, while several held up pictures of relatives held in Gaza. According to Haaretz, police let the protesters approach within 100 metres of Netanyahu\u2019s house, up to the security booth at the entrance. Iran has confirmed that four members of its Revolutionary Guards have been killed in Saturday\u2019s missile strike on Damascus. Several members of Syrian armed forces were also killed, Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said in a statement, reported by Al Jazeera: Once more the criminal Zionist regime has moved to violate the city of Damascus, the Syrian capital, and during an airstrike by the fighter jets of the invading and occupying regime a number of Syrian forces and four military advisers of the Islamic Republic of Iran were martyred.\u201d Al Jazeera added that Iranian state television had called it a \u201cterrorist\u201d attack by Israel. The news organisation also reports that one of the IRGC killed was believed to be the head of the intelligence department of the Quds force, the most elite unit of the IRGC. The Iranian state-owned news network, Press TV, published footage that it said showed the \u201cextensive devastation\u201d caused by the strike in the Mazzeh neighbourhood on Saturday: A likely Israeli strike on Damascus killed five people in a building where \u201cIran-aligned leaders\u201d were meeting on Saturday, a war monitor said, according to a report from the international news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cAn Israeli missile strike targeted a four-storey building, killing five people \u2026 and destroying the whole building where Iran-aligned leaders were meeting,\u201d said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). The British-based monitor with a network of sources inside Syria said the targeted Mazzeh neighbourhood is known to be a high-security zone home to leaders of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards and pro-Iran Palestinian factions. The area is also home to the UN\u2019s headquarters, embassies and restaurants. \u201cThey were for sure targeting senior members,\u201d of those groups, said Rami Abdel Rahman, the director of SOHR. The mid-morning strike on Saturday, which caused a large plume of smoke to billow into the sky, was also reported by Syrian state media. \u201cAn attack targeted a residential building in the Mazzeh neighbourhood in Damascus, resulting from an Israeli aggression,\u201d the Syrian state news agency Sana reported. It did not say if there were any casualties. An AFP correspondent at the scene said the destroyed building was cordoned off with ambulances, firefighters and Syrian Arab Red Crescent rescue teams all present at the site. Civil defence were busy searching for survivors under the rubble of the totally collapsed building, he added. \u201cI heard the explosion clearly in the western Mazzeh area, and I saw a large cloud of smoke,\u201d a resident told AFP. \u201cThe sound was similar to a missile explosion and minutes later I heard the sound of ambulances.\u201d In December, an Israeli airstrike killed Razi Moussavi, a high-ranking Iranian general. Israel rarely comments on individual strikes targeting Syria, reports AFP, but it has repeatedly said it will not allow Iran, which backs the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government, to expand its presence there. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has said the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza \u201cremains dire\u201d, with people returning to \u201cprimitive methods for food preparation and general hygiene\u201d. It also said the situation had been \u201cexacerbated by the continuous Israeli blockade hindering aid delivery\u201d. In a post on X, the PRCS quoted Mohammed Abu Msbeh, its director of ambulances and emergency centres in the Gaza Strip, as saying: People have returned to primitive methods for food preparation and general hygiene, to make bread. The daily struggle for water is a daily torment for Gaza residents to secure life-sustaining droplets, who stand in large crowds for hours with containers. The level of pollution in Gaza and the north raises alarming concerns about consecutive and serious health threats, as well as the potential spread of epidemics.\u201d Further updates on the news of a likely Israeli missile strike that destroyed a building in Damascus and reportedly killed a member of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards have come in on Reuters. Essam al-Amin, head of the al-Mowasat hospital in Damascus, told the local Syrian outlet al-Watan that his hospital had received one corpse and three wounded people, including a woman, after Saturday\u2019s attack. A spokesperson for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) told Reuters that no members of their group were wounded in the strike, after reports that some were at the bombed-out building. Reuters earlier reported that a security source in the regional pro-Syria alliance told the news agency that the strike on Saturday killed a member of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards and wounded others. The security source, part of a network of groups close to Syria\u2019s government and its major ally Iran, said the multistorey building struck was used by Iranian advisers supporting the government of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. The source said it had been entirely flattened by \u201cprecision-targeted Israeli missiles\u201d on Saturday. There was no immediate comment from Israel, reported Reuters. The latest figures from the Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas, said 165 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes and 280 injured in the past 24 hours. Reuters reported that a total of 24,927 Palestinians had been killed and 62,388 had been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. We have another update from Reuters on the breaking news that a likely Israeli attack had targeted a residential building in Damascus on Saturday. A source in the regional pro-Syria alliance told Reuters that the strike had killed a member of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards and wounded others. The source said the multi storey building was used by Iranian advisers supporting Syria\u2019s government and that it was entirely flattened. Citing Syrian state media, Reuters report it taking place in the Mazzeh neighbourhood. Other local media in Syria reported explosions heard across the capital. Al Jazeera reports that at least 18 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli bombings since dawn. The information has come in via its journalists in the area \u2013 Al Jazeera is one of the few news organisations with a functioning bureau in Gaza. The news organisation said two Palestinians were killed and several others injured in an Israeli bombing on al-Amal neighbourhood in the city of Khan Younis, bringing the number of victims of shelling on several areas in the city since dawn on Friday to 18 dead and dozens wounded. An Al Jazeera correspondent reported that the vicinity of al-Shifa hospital, including residential complexes where a large number of civilians live, was subjected to Israeli air and artillery bombardment. They added that a number of the injured have not yet been recovered from the scene. Al Jazeera also reported that Israeli forces blew up a residential square in the al-Balad area in the centre of Khan Younis city and that houses and facilities were also blown up in the Bani Suheila area in the east of the city. The news organisation cited footage that showed smoke rising from those areas as a result of the bombings carried out by the Israeli occupying forces. Reuters has posted a breaking news snap on Syrian state media saying there has been a likely Israeli attack on a residential building in Damascus. We\u2019ll have more details as they emerge. Health services in Gaza are \u201cdecimated\u201d, with medical staff exhausted after three months of war forced to extract shrapnel without adequate pain relief, conduct amputations without anaesthetics and watch children die of cancers because of a lack of facilities and medicine. Dozens of interviews with doctors and medical administrators in Gaza reveal a catastrophic and deteriorating situation as health services struggle to cope with tens of thousands of casualties of the continuing Israeli offensive in the territory and the effects of the acute humanitarian crisis. Attention has focused on the direct casualties of Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza, but medical specialists are increasingly concerned about indirect victims of the war. Tens of thousands in Gaza with chronic life-threatening illnesses have gone without treatment for months, and are now \u201cwithout defences\u201d, their bodies\u2019 weakened by malnutrition, cold and fatigue, doctors say. In one incident described to the Guardian, a child with a brain condition died hours before a UN team arrived with vital medicine. Cancer specialists said they had been unable to treat patients in desperate need, including children with leukaemia or tumours requiring immediate life-saving surgery. Dr Subhi Sukeyk, the director general of oncology for Gaza, said: We have nothing to give them. We cannot operate and we have no drugs at all. Of the 36 hospitals in Gaza only 15 remain open, and only three are undamaged. See the full story here: On Thursday morning the Iranian news website Entekhab ran, without irony, the headline: \u201cTaliban call on Pakistan and Iran to show restraint and urge both sides to settle differences through diplomatic means\u201d. If proof were needed that a new, more dangerous world order may be upon us, the Taliban cast in the role of advocates for restraint seems conclusive. Each day this week evidence mounted that the long-feared moment of escalation born out of the destabilising war in Gaza had arrived. The scenes in Gaza were too raw, and the geopolitical consequences for the conflict too vast, to remain confined within its borders. Last weekend, four waves of US missile strikes, some involving the UK, hit the ports and inland strongholds of the Houthis in Yemen. On Monday, Iran fired 24 missiles at an alleged Israeli spy centre in Erbil, in Kurdish northern Iraq, and at the same time struck Islamic State sites in Idlib, northern Syria. By Tuesday, Iran had broken new ground by striking Jaish al-Adl, a Sunni separatist group operating in Pakistan close to Iran\u2019s border. Within 48 hours Pakistani forces said they \u201csuccessfully struck hideouts used by terrorist organisations, namely Balochistan Liberation Army and Balochistan Liberation Front in Iran itself\u201d. All the while, Hezbollah and Israel exchanged now familiar rocket fire on the southern Lebanese border, so much so that the Israeli chief of staff admitted the possibility of all-out war was increasing. For all of this analysis on pockets of war multiplying across the region and increasing the risk of the conflict becoming more intractable, see here: Israel continued its strikes in the south of the Gaza Strip on Saturday after the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the US president, Joe Biden, discussed their differences over a post-war future for Palestinians which have suggested a rift between the two allies. Agence France-Presse reports that witnesses said the Israeli bombardment was again focused overnight on Khan Younis, the largest city in Hamas-controlled Gaza\u2019s south, although Palestinian media also reported intense fire around Jabalia in the north early on Saturday. Biden and Netanyahu held their first call since 23 December, a day after the Israeli leader reiterated his rejection of any form of Palestinian sovereignty, deepening divisions with Israel\u2019s key backer over the war. While the two leaders spoke of what might come next, the reality of the war was all too clear in Khan Younis and elsewhere in the Hamas-controlled territory. A child with a bloodied face cried on a gurney at al-Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, while ambulances carrying the wounded and the dead arrived to the sound of automatic weapons in the distance. However, Biden said after Friday\u2019s call with Netanyahu that it was possible the Israeli leader might still come around, telling reporters: There are a number of types of two-state solutions. There\u2019s a number of countries that are members of the UN that ... don\u2019t have their own militaries. And so, I think there\u2019s ways in which this could work. Netanyahu said on Thursday that Israel \u201cmust have security control over the entire territory west of the Jordan River\u201d, which \u201ccontradicts the idea of [Palestinian] sovereignty\u201d. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had said in Davos a day earlier that Israel could not achieve \u201cgenuine security\u201d without a \u201cpathway to a Palestinian state\u201d. Welcome to our live coverage of the Middle East crisis \u2013 this is Adam Fulton with a rundown on all the latest news. Israel continued its attacks in the southern Gaza Strip on Saturday after the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the US president, Joe Biden, discussed their differences over a post-war future for Palestinians which have suggested a rift between the two allies. Witnesses said the Israeli bombardment was again focused overnight on Khan Younis, southern Gaza\u2019s largest city, while Palestinian media also reported intense fire around Jabalia in the north early on Saturday. Biden and Netanyahu held their first call in nearly a month, a day after the Israeli leader reiterated his rejection of any form of Palestinian sovereignty. But Biden said after Friday\u2019s call that the creation of an independent state for Palestinians was not impossible while Netanyahu was still in office, saying he spoke with the Israeli prime minister about possible solutions for the creation of such a state, noting that not all countries have their own militaries. \u201cAnd so I think there\u2019s ways in which this could work,\u201d Biden said. More on that story shortly. In other key developments as its turns 8.40am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv: As Israeli forces have moved further into southern Gaza, airstrikes and close-combat fighting are approaching areas crowded with more than a million people seeking refuge from the destruction across the rest of the territory. The prospect of major operations taking place in territory with such a dense and vulnerable population is \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d, say aid officials, who fear Gaza\u2019s largest remaining hospital may have to be closed or evacuated. The US central command said its forces conducted strikes against three Houthi anti-ship missiles that were aimed into the Southern Red Sea and were prepared to launch. The US has been launching strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, and this week returned the Iran-backed Yemen-based group to a list of \u201cterrorist\u201d groups. The Houthis said on Friday they did not intend to expand their attacks on shipping in and around the Red Sea, beyond their stated aims of blockading Israel and retaliating against the US and Britain for airstrikes. Gaza\u2019s main internet provider, Paltel, said communication services across the Palestinian territory were gradually returning after a nearly eight-day outage, the longest blackout since the war began. Paltel said two of its technical team members lost their lives as a result of \u201cdirect shelling\u201d during recent repair operations, bringing the number of its employees killed to 14 since the start of the conflict. A senior minister in the Israeli war cabinet has said that only a ceasefire deal can win the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, and that Israel is unlikely to achieve its aim of \u201ctotal victory\u201d over the militant Islamist group. Gadi Eisenkot, a former chief of staff of the Israel Defence Forces, launched a blistering attack on Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s handling of the campaign against Hamas and failure to take responsibility for the failures that led to the Palestinian militant group\u2019s bloody attack on Israel in October. Health services in Gaza are \u201cdecimated\u201d, with medical staff exhausted after three months of war forced to extract shrapnel without adequate pain relief, conduct amputations without anaesthetics and watch children die of cancers due to a lack of facilities and medicine, doctors say. Pakistan\u2019s political and military leaders have moved to de-escalate tensions with Iran after trading deadly airstrikes on militant targets in each other\u2019s territory. Pakistan\u2019s foreign minister, Jalil Abbas Jilani, spoke to his Iranian counterpart, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and they agreed that \u201cclose coordination on counter-terrorism and other aspects of mutual concern should be strengthened\u201d, according to a readout from Islamabad\u2019s foreign ministry. Hezbollah\u2019s number two leader has warned Israel against expanding the conflict along the Lebanon-Israel border, where there have been near daily exchanges of cross-border fire between the Israeli army and the Iran-backed militant group. Naim Qassem said in a statement on Friday: \u201cIf Israel decides to expand its aggression, it will receive a real slap in the face in response.\u201d Any restoration of stability on the border was contingent on \u201cthe end of the aggression in Gaza\u201d, he added. Leading progressive and Jewish members of Congress have criticised the US\u2019s \u201cunconditional support\u201d for Israel after Benjamin Netanyahu declared bluntly that he was opposed to a Palestinian state after the war in Gaza and directly rejected American policy. Meanwhile, 60 of President Joe Biden\u2019s fellow Democrats have signed a letter urging his administration to reaffirm that the US strongly opposes \u201cthe forced and permanent displacement\u201d of Palestinians from Gaza. The White House said it was \u201cseriously concerned\u201d about reports that a Palestinian-American teenager had been killed by Israeli fire in the occupied West Bank. US-born Tawfiq Ajaq, 17, was killed by Israeli security forces in Al-Mazraa Al-Sharqiya, east of Ramallah, according to reports. Swiss prosecutors have confirmed that the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, is the subject of \u201ccriminal complaints\u201d filed during his visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos. A statement allegedly issued by the people behind the complaint said the plaintiffs were seeking a criminal prosecution in parallel to a case brought before the UN\u2019s international court of justice (ICJ) by South Africa, which accuses Israel of genocide in Gaza. The European Union has added six individuals to an asset freeze and visa ban blacklist for financing Hamas. The new EU sanctions framework targets \u201cany individual or entity who supports, facilitates or enables violent actions by Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad\u201d, a statement said. EU foreign ministers will hold a series of meetings on Monday with counterparts from Israel, the Palestinian Authority and key Arab nations about the war in Gaza and prospects for a future peace settlement. The Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz, and his Palestinian counterpart, Riyad al-Maliki, are not expected to meet each other. The EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has accused the Israeli government of financing Hamas in an effort to weaken the Palestinian Authority. Benjamin Netanyahu has denied accusations by his opponents in Israel and some global media who have accused his government of spending years actively boosting Hamas, including by allowing Qatari financing of Gaza."

            "title": "Former head of bank linked to Greensill Capital fined by UK regulator",
            "date": "2024-01-11T15:39:44Z",
            "content": "The former boss of a bank linked to the steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta has been fined nearly \u00a3120,000 for not managing the troubled lender\u2019s exposure properly. Iain Mark Hunter, the former chief executive of Wyelands Bank, will pay a fine of \u00a3118,808 for failing to ensure the lender had adequate systems and controls, the Bank of England said on Thursday. Wyelands Bank, which began winding down in March 2020, was part of the Gupta Family Group (GFG) Alliance, a sprawling business empire ranging from finance to metals that was the largest client of Greensill Capital, the financing company that went bust in 2021 after one of its main insurers declined to renew its cover. Greensill employed David Cameron, the foreign secretary and former prime minister, as an adviser at one stage, and was one of the biggest backers of GFG Alliance companies. Hunter has promised not to work in a regulated UK financial sector role in future as part of a settlement with the Bank of England\u2019s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). Sam Woods, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor for prudential regulation and the PRA\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThis outcome reflects material breaches of the PRA\u2019s senior manager conduct rules and individual conduct rules. \u201cIf senior individuals fail to meet the conduct rules, as Mr Hunter did, it undermines the trust in financial institutions and the wider financial system. Mr Hunter failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that large-exposures risks relating to Wyelands\u2019 business were appropriately identified and mitigated, and failed to take appropriate steps to verify the accuracy of statements he made to the PRA.\u201d Hunter also failed to comply with Wyelands\u2019 internal policy designed to mitigate potential conflicts of interest arising from its membership of the GFG Alliance, and failed to take appropriate steps to verify the accuracy of statements he made about Wyelands in two letters he wrote to the PRA, the regulator said. The PRA said Hunter had agreed to settle after the end of the discount period, and therefore did not qualify for a 30% reduction in his fine. The Bank issued a public reprimand to Wyelands Bank \u2013 which Gupta renamed after his country house and estate near Chepstow in south Wales \u2013 last April for \u201cwide-ranging significant regulatory failures\u201d. The PRA said it would have fined the lender \u00a38.5m had it not already been in the process of winding down. Wyelands had lent far too much money to GFG and did not have proper strategies in place to manage this risk or to mitigate potential conflicts of interest, it said. GFG said at the time that it had supported the PRA in the process, and had provided funding to ensure that all depositors were repaid in full and that the bank was able to operate to \u201cconclude its solvent wind-down\u201d. GFG is a group of companies, many related to steel and aluminium production, spanning 30 countries. It has previously said it has 35,000 employees worldwide, and its Liberty Steel business has significant operations in the UK. Hunter, who now works for the chief governance office at GFG Alliance in Dubai, was contacted for comment. GFG Alliance declined to comment on Hunter\u2019s fine."

            "date": "2024-01-03T19:45:33Z",
            "content": "Family and friends are squashed into the late Camila Batmanghelidjh\u2019s neat, tiny, kaleidoscopically colourful flat in north-west London. There are tears and hugs. Dates are passed round and cups of tea. \u201cOne thing is for sure,\u201d said Lindita Berila, who has dropped in to pay her respects, \u201ceveryone knew Camila was special.\u201d A few days previously, Batmanghelidjh had been here with colleagues helping to wrap thousands of Christmas presents to be delivered the next day to disadvantaged children. \u201cShe looked fabulous,\u201d said her brother Bobby. \u201cThere was no indication she was going to leave us.\u201d Her death on New Year\u2019s Day, at the age of 61, ended arguably one of the extraordinary modern public lives, encompassing gifted social entrepreneurship and leadership, celebrity and fame, a talent for politics, a precipitous media-fuelled fall from grace, a dramatic courtroom exoneration, and a below-the-radar late-life resurgence. She was adored by staff, an inspirational figure, said Rachel Mugan, a former head of clinical operations at Batmanghelidjh\u2019s charity, Kids Company, as she sat in her former boss\u2019s front room. \u201cKids Company was in incredibly unified charity,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWe always knew what we had to do \u2013 go out and love the children.\u201d A charismatic Iranian immigrant, Batmanghelidjh became a household name as a children\u2019s campaigner, as well as a confidante of princes, prime ministers, pop stars and traumatised teens. But her fall from grace was equally steep. Buoyed up by her fundraising, Kids Company became mired in financial problems. Damaging allegations of sexual abuse on its premises were eventually dismissed as baseless by the police but not before the charity, its fundraising ability in tatters, closed in August 2015, triggering vicious media attacks. Mugan, who has set up her own charity, Free to Be Kids, added that the charity wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 no organisation ever is. But it made a difference to many of the children it cared for: \u201cWhat Camila taught us was about love.\u201d There are still many who distrust the Kids Company legacy \u2013 an MPs report from 2017 set a critical tone, and a Charity Commission inquiry published a year ago concluded there had been administrative mismanagement at the charity. But many have sought to pay tribute to the services she created \u2013 and the tens of millions she raised \u2013 to provide support for youngsters scarred by poverty, abuse and gang violence. Danny Kruger, the Tory MP, tweeted: \u201cCamila was an inspiration to me &amp; many others working with vulnerable young people in the 2000s. The tragic end of Kids Co was a cautionary tale about charity &amp; public money. But I honour her memory for the way she stressed creativity, relationships, &amp; the potential in everyone.\u201d But for five years Kids Company was a byword for chaos and recklessness \u2013 and she was discredited. At least until her exoneration in 2021 after a two-year, \u00a39.5m court case brought by the Official Receiver in a bid to comprehensively disqualify her. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that finally the facts won,\u201d Batmanghelidjh told the Guardian at the time. The judge concluded that there was no mismanagement at Kids Company, or misuse of charitable funds. She praised Batmanghelidjh\u2019s \u201cenormous dedication\u201d and the \u201cincredible work\u201d of her charity. \u201cHer devotion to the interests of the young people whom the charity served was apparent throughout and not in doubt,\u201d she wrote. But the stress and effort, as well as Covid, took its toll. Some of her friends, said her brother Ardi, 64, had effectively abandoned her when the media turned on her. \u201cShe hid the pain,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was seriously hurt by her treatment. She was hurt by the falsehoods.\u201d She also had an auto-immune condition from childbirth which meant her body retained excess fluids. In her final months she was in and out of hospital, where she contracted a debilitating infection. Doctors were hopeful she would recover but she died in her sleep on New Year\u2019s Day. \u201cShe was the only person who ever understood me,\u201d said Dion, 14, who came to her flat with his mother, Lindita, to pay tribute. Both were distraught. Batmanghelidjh had taken him aside and patiently taught him maths once week at home when, as a small child, his autism meant he had made no progress at school. Ali Sam, 19, wept as he recalled Batmanghelidjh being there for him when his father died four years ago. She would speak to him through the window of her ground floor flat every day during lockdown when, as he puts it, he was in danger of going off the rails. \u201cI owe so much to Camila. She was like a grandmother to me. She helped me so much,\u201d he said. \u201cShe told the truth, however difficult it was for others to see it,\u201d said Bobby. He talked about plans to set up a charitable foundation in her name to fund the continuation of her work through teaching and education. He added: \u201cWhatever we do, the focus will be kids.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-26T15:13:48Z",
            "content": "When Anna Jones was interviewed about co-founding a women-only private members club to foster female entrepreneurship \u2013 having left a high-profile role running the UK publisher of Cosmopolitan, Esquire and Men\u2019s Health to go it alone \u2013 she sported a T-shirt emblazoned with \u201cgirl power\u201d in orange block capitals. Seven years on Jones has been appointed as the first female chief executive of the Telegraph\u2019s parent company, exemplifying the progress she has championed in an almost 25-year career in media businesses. Jones, whose friends and former bosses uniformly describe as an energetic and highly capable executive with a \u201ccan do\u201d mentality, has boldly stepped into the role abruptly vacated by Nick Hugh at possibly the most tumultuous time in the 169-year history of the rightwing national title. She takes the reins with the prospect of its owners, the Barclay family, transferring control of the Telegraph in a controversial and complex deal to a consortium backed by the United Arab Emirates. \u201cShe is what I\u2019d call a liberal feminist,\u201d said one former colleague. \u201cBlimey, the ownership, current and what is incoming, I wonder what she thinks of that?\u201d Jones, who grew up in Yorkshire, has had a fair bit of time to think about that quandary having been an adviser to the Telegraph executive team on \u201cstrategic and commercial growth plans, merger and acquisition strategy and leadership development programmes\u201d since last January. After leaving Hearst, where she worked for more than five years, including three years as chief executive, she co-founded the women-only networking venture AllBright, which opened its first private members club in Mayfair, London on International Women\u2019s Day in 2018. AllBright is named after the former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright, who once said \u201cthere is a special place in hell for women who don\u2019t help other women\u201d. In her seven-year break between running major media businesses, Jones has filled her resum\u00e9 with roles and ventures including co-founding WJV, a boutique investment firm that \u201cchampions diversity, wellness and economic empowerment\u201d, chairing the investment committee of the seed funding business Mercuri, taking a part-time role as a UN Women UK changemaker and serving as board member of the Creative Industries Federation. Now the 48-year-old, who is allergic to apples and lists her interests as pilates, baking and her children, has moved from entrepreneur to one of the highest profile roles in UK media. The shift makes for a curious move, with Jones describing herself in a previous interview as impatient person and expressing frustration with slow-moving corporate structures that mean implementing change is like \u201cturning a tanker\u201d. Still, she has kept her hand in the big leagues. She is now a non-executive director at Universal Music, the world\u2019s biggest music company, and was formerly a non-executive director at Telecom Italia. Those roles came in part as a result of her time spent working with Arnaud de Puyfontaine, the chief executive of the sprawling French media conglomerate Vivendi, which has stakes in both companies and who was her boss when he ran Hearst\u2019s European operations. \u201cThe reinvention of a media brand is a hell of a journey,\u201d says De Puyfontaine, who successfully pushed for Jones to become his successor at Hearst UK when he left London for Paris in 2014. \u201cShe is extraordinarily energetic, motivated and driven with very good managerial skills, a can-do person, I\u2019m a big fan. Nothing prevents the energy of her entrepreneurship, alongside her previous corporate experience, to push ahead one of the most famous British media brands \u2013 depending on [what] the new ownership [want].\u201d Jones is all too familiar with the digital challenges facing the Telegraph, having spent most of her career in the magazine industry. From 2000, she spent five years at Emap as marketing manager for the \u201cwomen\u2019s group\u201d of titles, Grazia, More and Top Sante. She subsequently moved to Hachette Filipacchi, the publisher of magazines and websites including Elle, Red and Digitalspy.com, where she rose to the role of digital and strategy director. Hearst acquired Hachette in 2011 with Jones taking the role of chief operating officer of the enlarged company before she stepped up to the role of chief executive in 2014. \u201cShe was a real pleasure to work with,\u201d says a senior editorial executive at her former employer. \u201cShe was very sunny, hands on, encouraging and wanted everyone to be more entrepreneurial in their businesses.\u201d Aware of the upheaval and general groundswell of negativity over the ownership saga in the Telegraph newsroom, Jones indicated in her appointment announcement that the wellbeing of employees continues to be high on her agenda. \u201cAlthough the business is operating in a period of uncertainty due to the change of ownership process, the titles continue to thrive and my role will focus on securing certainty for our staff, subscribers and partners,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2024-01-25T13:00:02Z",
            "content": "David Cameron breached \u201cproper process\u201d when he appointed Michelle Mone to the House of Lords in 2015, David Mundell, who was the Scotland secretary at the time, has said. Mundell, the Conservative MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale, said Lord Cameron appointed Mone without Downing Street consulting the government\u2019s Scotland Office, which is standard practice before awarding peerages to Scots. Cameron, recently appointed to the Lords himself, and other Westminster Tories had been impressed by Mone when she backed the union in the Scottish independence referendum. She was already well known in Scotland through her lingerie business, Ultimo. Mundell, who was the secretary of state for Scotland from 2015 to 2019, said some Scottish businesspeople were unhappy with Mone\u2019s peerage, but he did not have an opportunity to discuss it until after Cameron had confirmed the appointment. \u201cThe peerage was a fait accompli by the time we heard about it,\u201d Mundell said. \u201cI was unhappy that the proper process was not followed and that the Scotland Office was not asked to provide any background or input. And I wasn\u2019t at all surprised to find that Scottish businesses were very, very unhappy about the appointment. \u201cI did communicate with Downing Street that Scottish business figures were unhappy because they did not consider Michelle Mone to be a substantial businesswoman.\u201d Shortly before giving her a peerage in August 2015, Cameron made Mone his \u201centrepreneurship tsar\u201d, and she was appointed to lead a review for Iain Duncan Smith, then the work and pensions minister, on supporting people in deprived areas to set up businesses. The government\u2019s announcement described her as a \u201cleading entrepreneur and businesswomen [sic]\u201d. Later the same month, Cameron made her a Conservative life peer in his 2015 dissolution honours list, the official citation describing her as a \u201cleading entrepreneur\u201d. The peerage, carrying the title Baroness Mone of Mayfair, was controversial at the time and the subject of outspoken criticism by some Scottish businesspeople. Douglas Anderson, the managing director of the Glasgow-based plant hire company Gap Group, gave his views in strong terms in a letter to Cameron after reading initial press reports that a peerage was being considered. Anderson pointed out that published financial accounts of the Ultimo company showed it had been making losses and been in financial difficulties, and that in 2013 it had been rescued by a Sri Lankan clothing manufacturer, MAS Holdings. \u201cMs Mone is not a successful entrepreneur, she is a small-time businesswoman with a PR exposure far in excess of any actual success,\u201d Anderson wrote. \u201cAwarding her a peerage for a very mediocre business performance brings the awarding of titles into disrepute by rewarding failure.\u201d A spokesperson for Mone said she \u201ccame from a working-class family in Glasgow\u2019s East End and worked hard to become a successful entrepreneur, building one of the biggest independent lingerie brands in the world\u201d. She was \u201cproud of her achievements\u201d, the spokesperson added. \u201cMichelle was honoured to be asked to join the House of Lords by David Cameron after her role in the Scottish referendum campaign. Her appointment was duly vetted by Holac [the House of Lords appointments commission] at the time.\u201d Holac\u2019s role is to vet people nominated as peers \u201cfor propriety\u201d, and can withhold support if there are legal or regulatory issues, such as an outstanding tax investigation. Cameron did not respond to an invitation to comment. A Cabinet Office spokesperson pointed out that all peerages were vetted by Holac. Mone, 52, with her husband, Doug Barrowman, 58, is facing a National Crime Agency investigation into the procurement of \u00a3203m of government PPE contracts during the Covid pandemic for PPE Medpro. Both now admit involvement in the company but deny any wrongdoing. The PPE Medpro contracts were awarded in 2020 via the government\u2019s \u201cVIP lane\u201d for politically connected people, including Tory peers, after Mone approached the Cabinet Office ministers Michael Gove and Theodore Agnew, offering to supply personal protective equipment."

            "title": "Michelle Mone: leading entrepreneur or lucky baroness?",
            "date": "2024-01-25T13:00:02Z",
            "content": "Throughout the stunning interviews the Conservative peer Michelle Mone gave last month, finally admitting she had lied for years when denying her involvement in lucrative PPE deals, she still maintained a claim central to her remarkable rise. Hands neatly placed in her lap, she was, she told the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg, a \u201cvery successful individual businesswoman\u201d. Mone and her husband, the Isle of Man-based businessman Doug Barrowman, are facing a long-running National Crime Agency investigation into allegations of bribery and fraud in their securing of \u00a3200m in government contracts for a company, PPE Medpro. Both now admit involvement in the company, but deny any wrongdoing. It is telling that the couple, in complete contradiction to their previous aggressive legal denials, are now claiming it was Mone\u2019s business experience and contacts that enabled them to deliver PPE. \u201cI\u2019ve got 25 years\u2019 manufacturing experience, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why I was put into the House of Lords,\u201d Mone told Kuenssberg in December. When Covid hit, she said: \u201cI looked at Doug and I thought, we could really, really help here. And I just know all the key players in the far east. And I made the call to Michael Gove.\u201d Barrowman, who also took part in the BBC interview, had made a similar claim in a film paid for by PPE Medpro that was released on YouTube a week earlier. \u201cMichelle and I looked at each other one day and said, you know, we have strong contacts \u2026 in the far east,\u201d he said. \u201cEssentially, Michelle reached out to her contacts, we formed a consortium venture with a company based in Hong Kong and a company based in the UK.\u201d Analysis of documents, however, raises questions about whether Mone really did use her contacts in the far east, as is now claimed \u2013 or whether her role was principally to exploit her Tory political connections to secure those lucrative contracts. Her claims about her level of success as a businesswoman have also been disputed. Her company had been heading into insolvency and needed to be rescued shortly before she was given a peerage. And with David Cameron back in government, having himself recently been made a member of the House of Lords, there is a clear connection between the peerage he gave Mone in 2015 and the PPE Medpro \u201cVIP lane\u201d scandal damaging the Tories on voters\u2019 doorsteps. Hong Kong and the consortium Mone made the first approach on behalf of PPE Medpro to the ministers Michael Gove and Theodore Agnew in May 2020, offering to supply PPE through \u201cmy team in Hong Kong\u201d. Her offer was fast-tracked through the government\u2019s \u201cVIP lane\u201d for politically connected people, and within weeks the newly formed company had been awarded two contracts worth \u00a3203m. Later, the Guardian revealed that leaked bank documents indicated Barrowman \u2013 who at the time was still denying any involvement \u2013 had been paid at least \u00a365m from PPE Medpro\u2019s profits. He had then transferred \u00a329m into a trust, of which Mone and her three adult children were beneficiaries. In the BBC interview, Barrowman finally admitted he had made multimillion-pound profits. Not mentioned, however, was that three other companies had been involved in the supply of the PPE, and, according to a Guardian analysis, had shared a further \u00a330m in profit. One of these companies had been paid a large fee to make an introduction to another company in Hong Kong. Files leaked to the Guardian revealed the structure of the operation. PPE Medpro had entered into an agreement with a separate company, which had committed to supply the PPE. In this agreement, PPE Medpro stated that its role was to use its \u201cextensive network\u201d to secure contracts from the British government. The Guardian has repeatedly asked Mone and Barrowman whether that was a commitment to use Mone\u2019s political connections with Tory ministers. They have never replied directly to that question. It was the other company, London-based Loudwater Trade and Finance Ltd, whose role was to \u201cmanage and secure the supply chain of key PPE items from China and abroad\u201d. Loudwater in turn contracted with another company, Neumer Trading, for an introduction to the company in Hong Kong, Eric Beare, which bought the PPE from factories in China. Loudwater, Eric Beare and Neumer Trading have declined to comment. After their broadcast interviews, the Guardian asked Barrowman and Mone why, if the baroness \u201cknew all the right people in the far east\u201d, the supply chain had paid an intermediary company for an introduction in Hong Kong. They did not respond directly to this question. Of the PPE delivered to fulfil the two contracts, the government rejected the entire consignment of surgical gowns and is suing PPE Medpro for return of the \u00a3122m paid. PPE Medpro is defending the claim, arguing that the gowns were fit for purpose. Mone and Ultimo Mone\u2019s claims of great business success, key contacts in the far east and deep manufacturing experience spring principally from her lingerie company, Ultimo, which launched her to celebrity-tycoon status nearly two decades ago. Through the 2000s, Mone built the Ultimo company, MJM International, with her first husband, Michael Mone. They achieved commercial success, reaching a pre-tax profit of almost \u00a31m in 2007-08. Michael Mone is widely said to have concentrated on the operations of the business, while Michelle Mone developed her talent for promoting the brand. Glamorous pictures of models, and later Mone herself, wearing Ultimo bras and underwear were splashed across the internet as celebrity culture boomed. In August 2015, Cameron appointed Mone, who had supported the union in the Scottish independence referendum, as his \u201centrepreneurship tsar\u201d, and gave her a peerage later the same month. His government\u2019s statements promoted her image of success, lauding her as a \u201cleading entrepreneur\u201d and stating that \u201cshe took the lingerie brand global before the multimillion-pound sale of 80% of the business last year\u201d. The reality \u2013 still generally ignored, but evidenced by Ultimo company documents and a damning 2014 employment tribunal judgment \u2013 presents a rather less glittering picture. Mone does not appear to have made multiple millions of pounds from the sale of the company. In fact, the company had been heading for insolvency until it was rescued by a Sri Lankan clothing manufacturer, MAS Holdings. From 2011 onwards, the Mones\u2019 marriage had fractured and the company\u2019s fortunes had plunged. Michelle Mone later went public with some of the fallout, publishing an autobiography in February 2015 that was extensively serialised in the Daily Mail. Headlines were made as Mone related that she had taken a knife to Michael\u2019s Porsche and scratched it \u201cto shreds\u201d, let down his car tyres, \u201ccut holes in all his boxer shorts\u201d and once \u201cslipped some laxatives into his coffee\u201d. The employment tribunal case, brought in Glasgow by Ultimo\u2019s operations director, Scott Kilday, found that he had been unfairly dismissed because his office had been bugged after the MAS takeover. The judgment set out the details of MJM\u2019s financial predicament before the takeover. By May 2012, it said, the company \u201cwas in dire financial straits \u2026 There was a real possibility that the [company] would become insolvent if it failed to find a buyer.\u201d Mone reached a deal with MAS, which paid her \u00a31.3m for the company. She first had to buy more than half the shares from Michael and another small shareholder. A new company was then set up and Michelle became a director. A key MAS director, Eliaz Poleg, became anxious that Kilday \u2013 \u201ca vital employee\u201d \u2013 would leave for Michael\u2019s new business, or was leaking information to Michael, which Kilday denied. \u201cMr Poleg \u2026 was keen for [Kilday] to stay as in his view he was \u2018the pole that kept the tent up\u2019,\u201d the tribunal noted. \u201c[Poleg] had nobody else to keep the ship afloat. Mrs Mone was not hands on from an operational point of view and Mr Mone had left the business.\u201d Poleg decided \u201cwith hesitation and reservation\u201d to \u201cplace a recording device in [Kilday\u2019s] office\u201d. Poleg \u201casked [another MAS representative] and Mrs Mone to make the necessary arrangements\u201d. Kilday discovered the device in a plant pot, \u201cwas horrified\u201d, and immediately resigned. The MAS takeover involved a new company being formed, Ultimo Brands International. Initially, MAS owned 51% of this new company and Mone 49%. Despite investment from MAS, Ultimo continued to make losses. By January 2015, MAS had invested more and Mone\u2019s stake had been reduced to 20%. When asked whether Mone had been paid for this reduction of her shareholding, an MAS spokesperson said: \u201cMAS continued to invest directly in the company with the intention of turning the business around.\u201d He added that the increase in MAS\u2019s stake to 80% had been \u201cdue to the continued investment\u201d. Mone did not respond directly to questions from the Guardian about these financial arrangements. Ultimo never recovered, however, and Mone\u2019s shareholding was further diluted. She appears to have still had a small minority stake when the decision was taken in August 2018 to appoint a liquidator and wind up Ultimo. A \u2018fait accompli\u2019 peerage In 2015, a year after the media had reported on the Kilday employment tribunal, and just six months after the revelations in Mone\u2019s autobiography, Cameron made her the government\u2019s \u201centrepreneurship tsar\u201d. She was appointed to lead a review for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) into supporting people from deprived backgrounds to set up their own businesses. The then work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, proclaimed himself \u201cdelighted\u201d at her appointment, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s no one I can think of who is better qualified.\u201d Weeks later, Cameron appointed her to the House of Lords, with the title Baroness Mone of Mayfair. Looking back at that period, it is striking to recall the public criticism from her native Scotland, where people knew the Mones and the Ultimo business much better than in England, where papers carried gleeful \u201cBaroness Bra\u201d coverage. Douglas Anderson, the managing director of the large Glasgow-based plant hire company Gap Group, was among business figures to speak out, providing his views in a letter to Cameron. \u201cMs Mone is not a successful entrepreneur,\u201d Anderson wrote. \u201cShe is a small-time businesswoman with a PR exposure far in excess of any actual success.\u201d David Mundell, the secretary for Scotland at the time, told the Guardian that Downing Street had bypassed convention that all proposed Scottish peerages are discussed with the Scotland Office. \u201cThe peerage was a fait accompli by the time we heard about it,\u201d Mundell said. \u201cI was unhappy that the proper process was not followed and that the Scotland Office was not asked to provide any background or input. And I wasn\u2019t at all surprised to find that Scottish businesses were very, very unhappy about the appointment. \u201cI did communicate with Downing Street that Scottish business figures were unhappy because they did not consider Michelle Mone to be a substantial businesswoman.\u201d The DWP review delivered less than Mone promised. There was some embarrassment when Mone tweeted a picture of herself on a visit to Stockport, in a chauffeur-driven government Jaguar, drying her top on the air-conditioning. \u201cThe things you do. In Government car drying my travel top,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cLove it so much.\u201d Downing Street published a report three months earlier than planned. It offered a handful of ideas to support business startups, although Cameron\u2019s government, dedicated to austerity, offered no new funding to deliver on any of these. Mone herself stressed repeatedly that she would \u201ccontinue to work in a personal capacity\u201d to create \u201ca nationwide network of bank-funded enterprise hubs\u201d but that never happened. A promised \u201cfinal part\u201d of the review did not materialise. The DWP did not answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about its statement that Mone had sold 80% of Ultimo in a multimillion-pound sale in 2014, or about her performance on the review, or why the report had been published early. A spokesperson for Mone, Barrowman and PPE Medpro replied to questions by saying: \u201cMichelle Mone came from a working-class family in Glasgow\u2019s East End and worked hard to become a successful entrepreneur, building one of the biggest independent lingerie brands in the world. She also sat on the Prince\u2019s Trust board for many years to help the next generation of entrepreneurs. Michelle has real life experience that makes her different to your typical, grey Westminster politician. \u201cMichelle was honoured to be asked to join the House of Lords by David Cameron after her role in the Scottish referendum campaign. Her appointment was duly vetted by Holac [the House of Lords Appointments Commission] at the time.\u201d The spokesperson added: \u201cAny suggestion that Michelle ran a successful lingerie company for many years but did not have any experience in manufacturing is laughable.\u201d Holac\u2019s role is to vet people nominated as peers \u201cfor propriety\u201d, and can withhold support if there are legal or regulatory issues such as an outstanding tax investigation. Cameron and Duncan Smith did not respond to invitations to comment. A Cabinet Office spokesperson pointed out that all peerages are vetted by Holac. One senior Conservative said he believed Cameron was attracted to the idea that Mone, as a young Scottish businesswoman, would give the Tories a brighter image in the House of Lords, but that he had failed to scrutinise her actual career. Five years on, when Covid hit, she was in place \u2013 a baroness swept into the \u201cVIP lane\u201d for untold riches."

            "title": "Conservative hostility to net zero proves the party has turned its back on British capitalism | David Edgerton",
            "date": "2024-01-22T10:00:53Z",
            "content": "Of all Rishi Sunak\u2019s blunders and policy decisions in 2023, perhaps the most consequential was his move to delay key milestones on the way to net zero. Sunak postponed the banning of sales of petrol and diesel cars and domestic boilers two months after the government authorised more carbon extraction from the North Sea. Cue outrage from the capitalists to the greens, from greens to even some Tories. What on earth was he doing? There is perhaps some sense in his decision to slow down. If net zero by 2050 is the final target, then the means of getting there must be realistic. But as our climate becomes more inhospitable, affecting food imports, infrastructure and ultimately living standards, the goal must instead be to reduce global emissions as quickly as possible, not meet a distant date for net zero. Yes, realistic means to decarbonise the British economy are needed, but he has not provided them. On the contrary, he is willing away the means, as he admits they are lacking. The reality is that this delay is not about realistic decarbonisation, but about the further Faragisation of the Conservative party, which is now a hard-right party of a sort familiar from the US. The core programme of this party is Brexit and all the fantasies this entails, and it is being further radicalised with a culture war and denial about anthropogenic climate change. Net zero is the new Brussels. This is all too clear in the oil and gas bill, to be debated in the House of Commons on Monday, which will compel the government to do annually what it can already do and has done \u2013 licence new North Sea oil and gas production. Shrouded in irrelevant mendacities about emissions and energy security, this is a performative bill throwing a bone to the Faragists and forcing Labour to tack and twist some more. Again, the Tories set the agenda for their own purposes, quite deliberately undermining what consensus there has been on climate policy \u2013 to the despair of Tories who have been concerned with the issue, notably Alok Sharma and Chris Skidmore. The Tory party is a party of rentiers for rentiers; its electorate is old and propertied. Once the party of British national capitalism, of big business, before it undid the very bases on which it depended, it no longer acts as the agent of productive change. Its aim is essentially to transfer resources from young to old, from workers to rentiers, from poor to rich; to support the landlord, the property developer and the extractive monopolies. Far from being incompetent, it has been extraordinarily successful in pursuing its agenda. It has no interest or competence in promoting a successful, transformative, decarbonised capitalism; indeed it shows a remarkably inadequate understanding of the dynamics of modern capitalism. Significant sections of global capitalism have noted that they will be forced to decarbonise. Massive investment programmes are under way that require corresponding actions by states to complement and support them. That is why there was so little support from capitalists operating in the UK for Sunak\u2019s net-zero U-turn. Car investors need to know when new petrol and diesel cars cars will be banned, and have confidence that they will be. And they need confidence that there will be an infrastructure to support electric cars, as the car industries, and others, have made clear. This is not to say that the British government has not supported elements of decarbonisation. Such is the pressure generated by subsidies offered in the US, the EU and China, that even free-market Tories have already been forced to pour subsidies of various kinds into nuclear reactors, battery plants, car factories and steelworks (as well as subsidising oil companies). Handing out subsidies to foreign companies to keep them operating in the UK does not equate to a coherent industrial policy that will lead to adequate decarbonisation. But the policy does at least recognise that the fantasies of world-beating British green tech are dead; there is no realistic prospect of creating a new British electric car or battery industry. The focus should not be on manufacturing new technology, but creating a domestic infrastructure that can provide clean energy to people cheaply. In fact, a whole new way of thinking about the economy is needed to decarbonise successfully, something that Labour has not yet embraced. It will involve thinking in new ways about the foundational economy, or everyday economy, as proposed by the five authors of a vital new book When Nothing Works: From Cost of Living to Foundational Liveability. These authors \u2013 Luca Calafati, Julie Froud, Colin Haslam, Sukhdev Johal and Karel Williams \u2013 rightly argue that instead of the economics of fantasy growth, we need a political economy of improvement. Instead of wishful thinking about science and entrepreneurship, we need to change things. We cannot think of decarbonisation as a green industrial revolution, or as a tool for new R&amp;D programmes and entrepreneurial startups or industrial policy. Instead we face a systemic issue that must be dealt with as such; at the centre of this needs to be a multi-dimensional analysis of the households nearly all of us live in. Whether the change needed can be achieved with private, barely regulated utilities extracting huge profits needs to be discussed. Furthermore, we will need to restrict certain things \u2013 including subsidies to air travel, airport expansion, new oil and coal production. All this will require a creative and competent state, and popular consent and engagement. Labour has shied away from all this, letting the Tories set the agenda, and is now seemingly confining its promises to a strangely unrealistic programme to decarbonise electricity by 2030 rather than the much more expensive and ambitious general decarbonisation that will be needed. It has been reluctant to think through what might need to be done, or to mobilise and campaign for the political support that will be necessary. Decarbonising will take much more than evoking Bidenomics, indulging fantasies of \u201cworld-beating\u201d British green tech, or liberalising planning and de-risking the investment of rentiers.

            "date": "2024-01-02T08:00:55Z",
            "content": "A fitter working for the furniture chain Sharps Bedrooms is taking legal action for better employment rights in a case that could open the door to improving conditions and pay for thousands of gig economy workers fitting kitchens, bathrooms and cupboards for big chains. David Lockwood, who has been classed as a self-employed independent subcontractor by Sharps, says he should instead bedefined as a worker \u2013 an official employment status which comes with benefits including holiday pay, statutory sick pay and the right to the legal minimum wage. It is understood that fitters working on kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms for other big brands are employed in a similar way. The legal action comes before one of the busiest times for household furniture sellers, which launch a string of discounts to win over shoppers before the peak sales period in March. Lockwood, 58, has worked for Sharps, which is based in the Midlands, for about 30 years installing pre-made fitted furniture such as wardrobes and cupboards. He claims that the company denies him agency in his role, subjects him to financial penalties and denies him the right to carry out work for competitors \u2013 elements that could define him as a worker. He has enlisted the law firm Leigh Day to help fight his case. He says the company, for example, controls the dates, times and fees for his work and would impose a financial penalty if he did not give at least 72 hours\u2019 notice if he could not attend a job. The action against Sharps, which has been owned by the UK private equity group Epiris since 2021, comes after a string of legal battles over the rights of workers in the gig economy. Ryan Bradshaw, a senior associate solicitor at Leigh Day, said:\u2028\u201cDavid has been a loyal worker for Sharps Bedrooms Ltd for decades, yet the company treat him as a subcontractor and are in control of David\u2019s work, setting the fees and parameters of his work. \u201cFurthermore, they are allegedly assuring customers that David is a member of their staff, yet putting \u2018subcontractor\u2019 on his pay statements and terms of engagement. \u201cWe hope that by bringing this legal claim, David\u2019s employment status can be settled and he will have access to the holiday pay and sick pay that he is owed.\u201d Lockwood said: \u201cAfter working for 25-plus years in full-time service to Sharps Bedrooms, I feel totally failed and disrespected by them. I believe that they have used unlawful loopholes to take advantage of hard and loyal workers.\u201d The case, which is being supported by Law for Change, a community interest company, is the latest to challenge the rights of works in the gig economy. Law for Change was set up by the campaigning lawyer Stephen Kinsella to fund public interest cases that it believes will contribute to lasting social change. In 2021, Uber was forced to pay its drivers the minimum wage and holiday pay after the supreme court dismissed the ride-hailing app\u2019s appeal against a landmark employment tribunal ruling that its drivers should be classed as workers. However, the takeaway and groceries courier firm Deliveroo continues to class its UK riders as self-employed independent contractors after the supreme court upheld previous judgments that they could not be classed as workers because they had the right to arrange a substitute to perform their duties if they did not want to or were unable to. Gig economy employment status remains a grey area as ministers have failed to bring in a modern employment bill with more protections despite promising to introduce new legislation a number of times since reforms were first mentioned in the Queen\u2019s speech in 2019. A spokesperson for Sharps said: \u201cWe disagree with the claims made by David Lockwood and Leigh Day and will be robustly challenging any legal action.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-10T00:00:15Z",
            "content": "People with disability working in supported employment are being legally paid less superannuation than the rest of the workforce due to outdated and contradictory workplace laws, an inequity for which advocates say there is \u201cno excuse\u201d. Under the federal superannuation guarantee, companies must pay all adult employees a super contribution of 11% of their ordinary wage. But under the supported employment services award 2020, employees with disability working in supported employment are entitled to only 9.5%, or $15 a week, whichever is greater. The lower rate of superannuation is on top of laws that already allow Australian disability enterprises (ADEs) to pay their staff vastly below the minimum wage, sometimes as low as $2.90 an hour. The national minimum wage is $23.23 an hour. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Supported employment, or ADEs, are programs in which people with disability work in a segregated environment under supervision. The award covers approximately 20,000 people. ADEs calculate a wage for a person with a disability based on an assessment of their productivity and competencies, or by reference to what is called the special national minimum wage. The last update to the superannuation rate for people with disability specified in the award was on 1 January 2021. The superannuation guarantee has been updated three times since then, at 0.5% each time. Super rates under the guarantee are scheduled to continue increasing for the next two years until they reach 12% in 2025. Guardian Australia has seen evidence that Orana, a major disability employment provider in South Australia with approximately 450 employees in supported employment, has been calculating superannuation for its employees with disabilities at the 9.5% rate based on the specification in the award. Supported employment roles at Orana include gardening and landscaping, customer service, industrial sewing, packing and assembly. Orana has been approached for comment. David Kirner from the Construction, Forestry and Maritime Employees Union in South Australia, said it was an example of how an outdated award was causing problems for people who were already marginalised and vulnerable. Kirner said the likelihood of wage theft increased substantially when the award contained incorrect or outdated information. \u201cThere\u2019s been a royal commission into the rights of people with a disability but you still have a modern award that says you\u2019ll still get 9.5% superannuation when everyone else gets 11% because nobody\u2019s updated it since 2021,\u201d Kirner said. Before 2019, low-income workers with a disability under the supported employment services award received just 3% superannuation, or a minimum of $6 a week. A campaign from the United Workers\u2019 Union resulted in the Fair Work Commission changing the rate to 9.5% \u2013 equivalent to the mainstream guarantee at the time \u2013 or $15 a week. Catherine McAlpine, chief executive of Inclusion Australia, said the incongruity between the award and the national guarantee was the sort of inequity and oversight that people with disability had come to expect. \u201cThere is absolutely no excuse to not pay people with an intellectual disability the same rate of superannuation as every other employee in the country,\u201d McAlpine said. \u201cPeople with intellectual disability are very clear that they are not respected as employees and that lack of respect is reflected in the very poor wages that they are paid.\u201d In the final report of the disability royal commission, handed down in October last year, four of the seven commissioners recommended the phase-out of disability enterprises and elimination of subminimum wages for people with disability by 2034. Inclusion Australia advocated to the commission for a non-segregated employment support system that gave people with disability ordinary award wages, access to all employment services, and a refocusing of disability enterprises. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we make the changes to better wages carefully to make sure that people with really high support needs don\u2019t lose either their existing job or the opportunity to be employed,\u201d McAlpine said.

            "content": "The pace of US economic growth slowed in the last three months of 2023, but far less than had been expected, underlining the continued resilience of the economy. The commerce department reported on Thursday that US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of economic health \u2013 grew at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the final quarter of the year, down from 4.9% in the previous quarter but in line with pre-pandemic growth, and well ahead of the 2% economists had expected. Robust consumer spending and government outlays contributed to the growth. The Federal Reserve has been attempting to cool economic activity in order to bring down inflation. Since March 2022 the Fed has increased rates to a 22-year high and held them there. Inflation has fallen from a high of 9% in June 2022 to 3.4%. The rate rises have increased the cost of borrowing and many \u2013 including the Fed \u2013 had expected a subsequent slowdown in economic activity to lead to layoffs. But so far the Fed appears to be on course for what it has termed a \u201csoft landing\u201d. Hiring has remained robust \u2013 unemployment hovers at close to a 50-year low \u2013 and while growth has slowed, consumers have continued to spend, the US economy has weathered the rate rises and stock markets have hit record highs. \u201cThe Fed \u2013 so far \u2013 has managed to strangle inflation without strangling the economy,\u201d said Dan North, senior economist with Allianz Trade Americas. North said the Fed rate rises were still working their way through the economy and he expected 2024 to be a year of slow growth \u201cbut we are not using the recession word yet\u201d. Polling since the end of the pandemic shutdowns has consistently shown that consumers are pessimistic about the state of the economy. There are signs that the gloom may be lifting. Last week the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched monthly consumer sentiment index rose 9.1 points to 78.8, its biggest monthly advance since 2005. \u201cConsumer views were supported by confidence that inflation has turned a corner and strengthening income expectations,\u201d said Joanne Hsu, the University of Michigan\u2019s director of surveys."

            "date": "2024-01-16T12:52:07Z",
            "content": "Pay growth in the UK slowed more than expected in November, in a sign that inflationary pressures have weakened more than the Bank of England was expecting when it issued its latest forecasts. Average pay growth was 6.5% in November, down from 7.2% in the previous month, according to the Office for National Statistics, as the UK jobs market weakened in response to high interest rates and stagnation across much of the economy. Economists polled by Reuters had expected total average earnings of 6.8% in November. Job vacancies tumbled at the fastest rate on record in December, the ONS said, in a further sign the UK labour market was now cooling. The ONS said despite the drop in wages growth, recent falls in inflation meant real wages grew for the fifth month in a row, easing the pressure on household disposable incomes. It added that overall, the jobs market remained stable with employment down only marginally and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.2%. The pound fell after the weaker than expected wage data prompted traders to raise bets that the Bank of England would start cutting interest rates in the spring. Sterling was down by 0.6% against the dollar at $1.2642. The central bank is expected to re-examine its outlook for the economy when officials meet next month. Most analysts expect the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee to hint at several interest rate cuts this year after acknowledging the weakening labour market and recent falls in inflation as indications of further stagnation. James Smith, the developed markets economist at ING, said it was probably a little early to expect a major change of direction by the Bank, \u201cbut recent data could lay the groundwork for a May cut as long as it continues to comply\u201d. He added: \u201cThe bottom line is that both wage growth and services inflation, the datasets that are guiding monetary policy right now, are below Bank of England projections.\u201d Financial markets expect five interest rate cuts this year by the Bank, taking interest down from 5.25% to below 4%. One of the Bank\u2019s key barometers, regular private sector pay growth, dropped further from a revised 7.2% in October (7.3% previously) to 6.5% in November, leaving it comfortably below the Bank\u2019s prediction for it to still be at 7.2% in December. Falling energy and fuel prices and the slowing economy have brought the headline rate of inflation down from 4.6% in October to 3.9% in November and are expected to exert further downward pressure in December when figures are released tomorrow. Samual Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said there was likely to be some concern inside the Bank that the steady picture for employment showed much of the jobs market remained tight, limiting further falls in wages and vacancies. The number of vacancies soared during the Covid pandemic as many older workers took early retirement, the number of workers signed off sick increased and younger workers opted to go back into education, but the ONS said vacancies fell for the 18th consecutive month in the three months to December, by 49,000 to 934,000. Analysts have also become increasingly concerned about recent global shocks from conflict in the Middle East that could harm trade and push shop prices back up again. The ONS figures on Tuesday showed that workers in the private and public sectors received almost the same level of pay rise, including bonuses, up by 6.4% and 6.6%, respectively, in the three months to November. In the private sector, restaurants, hotels and retailers offered the biggest pay rises of 7.2% on average, followed by City and finance workers, who received 7% on average. Construction workers were at the bottom of the pay league table with rises averaging 4.5%, reflecting the severe downturn across the building industry. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cIt has been tough for many families recently, but with inflation now falling and the economy gradually returning to growth today\u2019s continuing rise in real wages will offer further relief. \u201cOn top of this the cut in national insurance contributions will get more people back into the jobs market, not just supporting economic growth but saving a typical two-earner household about \u00a31,000 this year.\u201d"

            "content": "If 2023 marked the likely tail end of the fastest rise in interest rates in three decades, this year will reveal just how hard the economy\u2019s landing will be. To be sure, households trying to get by on jobseeker at $54 a day or $43 for the youth allowance could argue the economy has not been airborne for them for years. \u201cPeople on low incomes have been pushed to the absolute brink, forced to make impossible choices between feeding themselves, paying their rent or turning the lights on,\u201d says Edwina MacDonald, the acting chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service. The September quarter national accounts showed overall consumption had stalled. Excluding inflation, household disposable income was down by 5.6% over the year and 8.3% below its peak two years earlier, according to the Commonwealth Bank\u2019s head of Australian economics, Gareth Aird. A snapshot of available data so far for the October-December period \u201csuggests we may see an outright contraction in GDP over the quarter\u201d, Aird says. But those grim tidings for the year\u2019s end tell only part of the tale. The end of 2023 may be close to the nadir in this part of the economic cycle and, barring an unforeseen blow, an upswing shouldn\u2019t be far behind. Government\u2019s outlook upbeat That employers ignored the Reserve Bank\u2019s November rate rise to add more than 61,000 staff shows there is still momentum in the labour market. Home prices, too, reversed an early drop during 2023 to end the year close to or above previous highs bolstering at least the paper wealth of owners. The government\u2019s midyear economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo), released on 13 December, revealed the budget to be in unexpectedly rude health with a second straight surplus in range for the first time since 2007-08. Few peer nations are as well placed. New Zealand recently increased its projected budget deficit by more than half for the year to next June and has delayed a return to surplus until 2026-27. The UK government borrowed almost \u00a3100bn ($190bn) in the half-year to October and the US clocked up a US$314bn (A$450bn) deficit in November alone \u2013 the most ever for that month. The Myefo, though, was also more upbeat than the May budget about how much the global economy would support Australia\u2019s GDP. Net exports should add a full percentage point to growth in 2023-24 \u2013 rather than the 0.5 percentage points expected seven months earlier. That revision was significant, given annual GDP was only tipped to expand by 1.75%. A forecast improvement on the trade front buoyed the 2024-25 outlook even more. GDP growth was unchanged at 2.25% but the net exports contribution will jump from zero to 0.75 percentage points, according to Treasury\u2019s model. Overseas inflation trends also look like helping. US inflation has continued to decline. China\u2019s producer prices sank by 3% in November, indicating the world\u2019s biggest exporter will include deflation in what it ships abroad. A year ago, many forecasters were predicting the RBA would end 2023 with rate cuts. Their prognostications hinged in part on inflation falling faster than it has. The economy would also be skirting recession by now, many thought. As it happened, both inflation and growth turned out to be higher than they tipped, with Opec oil supply cuts and the later Israel-Hamas war pushing up energy prices. But just as Myefo presumably gives the government scope to increase support for consumers and businesses if needed, the RBA has the capacity to start cutting the cash rate from its 12-year high of 4.35% to help counter any sudden downturn. As it stands, markets are already fully pricing in the first 25-basis point cut by June, according to the ASX rates tracker. Overseas trends may be helpful too. The US Federal Reserve is now tipped to start cutting its main interest rate in 2024. Such a move would give the RBA cover to do the same without worrying about a fall in the Australian dollar jacking up the cost of imports and slowing the decline of our inflation. Economy not slowing down Deutsche Bank\u2019s Phil O\u2019Donoghue remains among the more hawkish of Australian-based economists, being the sole surveyed expert to predict the RBA would raise the cash rate in December. He predicts that increase will now come when the board next meets in February but will be followed by four cuts, or a full percentage point, to bring the cash rate to 3.6% by the end of this year as inflation slows. O\u2019Donoghue believes Australian households can absorb the higher borrowing costs so far. \u201cAustralian households still have about $180bn in excess Covid-era savings,\u201d he says. \u201c[Given] current levels of household debt and interest rates, the savings pool would cover the national mortgage interest bill for about six quarters.\u201d The RBA, too, is monitoring financial stress. In December Andrea Brischetto, the head of its financial stability unit, found fewer than 2% of borrowers were having to cope with both an income shortfall and a small savings buffer. One factor that helped to keep the economy expanding in 2023 was the jump in population, including a record net 518,000 migrants in the year to June. (Per capita GDP has been flat or in retreat for three quarters.) According to Myefo, net migration will drop to 375,000 this fiscal year. That will still be 60,000 more than factored into the May budget. For 2024-25, it retreats to 250,000, or 10,000 people fewer than the budget predicted. That will be welcomed by those hoping for a slowdown in the cost of housing, whether for purchase or rent, but will remove one factor propelling GDP. Still, economists such as Judo Bank\u2019s Warren Hogan say the economy should remain on a \u201csoft landing\u201d track. The recent labour market figures \u201csuggest the economy may prove resilient in 2024\u201d. \u201cIt is hard to see a sharp downturn in the economy while employment and incomes are expanding,\u201d Hogan says, and \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of construction work going on\u201d even after the government cut support for 50 infrastructure projects. \u201cYou don\u2019t look at [the national accounts] and think the next step for the economy is another leg down.\u201d Cherelle Murphy, EY Oceania\u2019s chief economist, agrees. \u201cThe government sector doesn\u2019t really look like it\u2019s slowing down,\u201d Murphy says. A lot of the states\u2019 infrastructure spending \u201cis actually ramping up into [this] year\u201d. The need to accelerate the rollout of renewable energy \u2013 as emphasised by the energy market operator recently \u2013 should provide one \u201clittle bit of upside to [next year] 2024\u201d, she says. Another may come from the expansion of the care economy, whether for the NDIS or an ageing population. Such industries tend to be jobs-rich and help to explain why Myefo and the RBA both project the unemployment rate to peak at 4.5% or less. As to how the RBA might act in 2024, Murphy notes the new governor, Michele Bullock, has stressed the central bank \u201cis trying really hard not to destroy the economy by over-tightening\u201d even as it reins in inflation. \u201cThey\u2019re trying \u2026 something which has not really successfully been done in the past too many times,\u201d she says. Perhaps 2024 will be one of those occasions."

            "content": "The Bank of England may be forced to bring forward the date of its first interest rate cut after three leading forecasters issued a surprise update suggesting the inflation rate will halve to 2% by April. The Oxford Economics consultancy and analysts at Investec and Deutsche Bank have reassessed their outlook for inflation in 2024 and concluded that the consumer prices index (CPI), which dropped to 3.9% in November last year, will fall below 2% within four months. A slump in energy prices and the cost of oil on international wholesale markets will, they say, bring down inflation at a faster rate than the Bank of England expected when it reviewed price rises in November. The independent forecasters said a fresh review next month by officials at the Bank\u2019s headquarters on Threadneedle Street was likely to follow their lead and predict a much lower path for inflation this year. In a series of speeches before Christmas, members of the BoE\u2019s interest rate setting committee said lending rates would remain high during 2024 to reduce the prospect of a return to galloping price rises. The Bank\u2019s governor, Andrew Bailey, had predicted a tough battle lay ahead to bring inflation back to its 2% target, pushing back against speculation in the financial markets that official borrowing costs would soon be reduced from their current level of 5.25%. Since then financial markets have brought forward betting on the first likely interest rate cut to April and raised the likelihood of another five cuts before the end of the year, bringing interest rates below 4% for the first time since January 2023. At a hearing of the Treasury committee on Wednesday, Bailey said he hoped the recent fall in the cost of mortgages would continue. \u201cObviously we have had a big change in market interest rates in the last few months and so the cost of mortgages is coming down,\u201d he said. Bailey refused to comment on the outlook for monetary policy, but said: \u201cLet\u2019s just take the market for a moment \u2013 obviously that is feeding through into mortgage costs and I hope that is something that continues.\u201d The rates for mortgages fixed over five years have tumbled in response to growing optimism about the fall in inflation. Investors have tended to disregard warnings about higher costs pushing inflation higher, including concerns about the Suez canal and a spike in shipping costs resulting from the war in the Middle East. Energy and fuel prices have declined on international wholesale markets, pushing down the cost of heating and transport. The cost of food, which is influenced by transport costs, is also expected to fall steeply this year. Andrew Goodwin, chief UK economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said he expected the CPI to average 2.1% in 2024, down from a forecast in November of 3.1%. \u201cInflation is on track to return to the 2% target in April,\u201d he added. Phil Shaw, senior UK economist at Investec, said the impact of tax cuts by the chancellor in the autumn statement, which he believed would raise consumer spending and persuade the BoE to keep interest rates high, was less than expected. He said inflation would fall to 1.5% in the third quarter of the year and the first rate cut would be implemented in June. Economists at Deutsche Bank predicted that UK inflation could drop \u201ca little below 2% in April and May\u201d, before hovering around 2% to 2.5% for the remainder of the year. Sanjay Raja, the chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said there were risks to his forecast. He said strong wage increases would put pressure on firms to raise prices and further tax cuts could increase consumer spending, allowing shops to charge more for goods and services. Raja added: \u201cThe recent disruption in global supply chains may also arrest the disinflationary momentum we\u2019re seeing in goods and food prices. We will be monitoring these risks carefully.\u201d"

            "title": "UK interest rate cuts cannot come soon enough for economy and Jeremy Hunt",
            "date": "2024-01-12T11:51:26Z",
            "content": "Jeremy Hunt knows there is little to celebrate from modest economic growth during November. The 0.3% increase in gross domestic product follows a drop of 0.3% in October, and the three-month figure \u2013 which is considered a more reliable and certainly less volatile measure of economic growth \u2013 showed a 0.2% contraction to the end of November. The services sector was moribund in the three months to November, while production output fell by 1.5% and construction fell by 0.6% over the same period. Simon French, the chief economist at the stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said the single-month figure showed there was \u201ca decent chance\u201d the UK had again avoided a recession. Sandra Horsfield, a UK economist at Investec, was less sure: \u201cIt remains touch-and-go whether the economy tipped into a technical recession in the second half of 2023.\u201d Both were looking through a microscope at small percentage points either side of zero, making it clear that, for the economy and the chancellor, interest rate cuts by the Bank of England cannot come soon enough. Without lower borrowing costs, a period of zero growth stretching back more than a year is likely to continue well into 2024, and with an election less than a year away, that spells disaster for the Conservative administration. Hunt said he was content for growth to remain low while all efforts were made to bring down inflation. The chancellor said this with the belief the battle against rising prices was almost won after a flurry of revisions by City economists of inflationary trends. This re-examination of the influences on the consumer prices index revealed price growth will probably drop below the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target in April, although prolonged disruption to shipping in the Red Sea will raise concerns about a fresh inflationary threat. Oil prices were up almost 4% on Friday, at just above $80 a barrel. Next month, when they meet in the Bank\u2019s Threadneedle Street headquarters, members of the monetary policy committee are likely to agree that their previous forecasts were too pessimistic and some of the drivers of inflation were weaker than previously estimated. They will come under severe pressure to begin cutting interest rates from 5.25%, maybe as early as May, easing the financial burden on households and businesses. Hunt will also benefit because lower inflation and lower interest rates will cut his debt bills and give him more room to carry out the tax cuts his party craves. Households and businesses may crank up their spending in the second half of the year and give the economy a boost. Jonathan Hall, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s financial policy committee, said in parliament last week that he was concerned the drop in inflation and possible cuts to interest rates would create a period of exuberance and a dangerously high level of borrowing. That might be a worry for the MPC and trigger a return of high interest rates, but that would be a problem for the next chancellor."

            "date": "2024-01-17T14:00:33Z",
            "content": "Just in case you were ever worried that the Australian housing market might crumble, the latest ABS housing loan figures show that in November the value of new housing finance was 13% above that of a year earlier. And because of the strong link between growth loans and house prices, this suggests that house prices should continue to rise very solidly through the next six months: If the graph does not display please click here It\u2019s quite amazing how nothing \u2013 not a pandemic, not rising interest rates \u2013 seems to do much to dampen the housing market. Amazing, that is, unless you forget that the entire focus of political pressure over the past 40 years or so has been designed to keep house prices from falling, or even abating. Given that, it is little wonder that Australians continue to think buying a house is a good financial decision and the cost of loans continues to rise: If graph does not display please click here Average mortgages over the past two years have been relatively flat but that came in the time that rates rose faster than they have in 30 years, and after the absurd price growth in 2020 and 2021. And even then the flatness mostly occurred in New South Wales and Victoria, while Queensland and South Australia especially have seen little sign of a pause: If the graph does not display please click here It says something that rising interest rates by 425 basis points only served to dampen house price growth but not really lower them. And that dampening should now be over. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The latest figures are from November \u2013 the last month in which the RBA raised rates. And since then, the outlook has changed rather dramatically. Just before the last increase, the market was expecting that the Reserve Bank would raise rates but only some time early this year. Investors then predicted that by early next year the RBA might be a chance to cut the cash rate back to 4.1%. Now investors believe the RBA will cut rates to that level by August with another cut before the end of the year and another one in the first half of 2025: If the graph does not display please click here This would of course be very pleasing news for homeowners given since the increase in rates there has been a big shift in the number of people taking out fixed-rate loans. If the graph does not display please click here Australians, unlike Americans, have always preferred variable home loans. Generally, about 85% or so of home loans would be variable. Early in the pandemic, as rates crashed to record lows, more people locked in those rates. But as rates have risen, the number of people taking out fixed-rate loans has plummeted. Last November only 2% of all new home loans were fixed rates. That means almost all new homeowners would benefit from lower rates. Of course, before breaking out the champagne, it is worth wondering why the market expects the RBA to cut the cash rate. Central banks don\u2019t cut interest rates because they think people deserve to pay lower interest rates, they do so because of the effect they think it will have on the economy. If we wish to view the glass as half-full, the RBA would cut rates because it believes the current rate is slightly above a \u201cneutral\u201d setting \u2013 a point at which rates are neither stimulating nor restricting economic growth. Most homeowners would think \u201cslightly above\u201d is rather a stretch given since the end of 2020 the monthly repayments on an average new loan have risen about 55% while over the same period wages have risen only about 8%: If the graph does not display please click here But as inflation returns to normal levels of about 3% the RBA would naturally think it is time to return raters to that \u201cneutral rate\u201d or about 3.8% \u2013 ie around two rate cuts\u2019 worth. By contrast, the glass half-empty view is that the RBA will need to cut rates because the economy slows by more than it hoped and unemployment is rising faster than it expected and so it is cutting rates to give the economy a boost. Either way, it does appear the peak of interest rates has been reached. That will be good news for the government and homeowner, less so for those who were unable to afford a house even with the recent \u201cflatness\u201d of price growth. Should prices once again take off faster than incomes, we may very well look back to now as the good times for housing affordability.

            "title": "ECB chief says talk of interest rate cuts \u2018premature;\u2019 US economy grows faster than expected \u2013 as it happened",
            "date": "2024-01-25T15:05:51Z",
            "content": "European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde has said that policymakers agreed at today\u2019s meeting that talk of interest rate cuts is \u201cpremature\u201d. Last week, she told Bloomberg in Davos that the bank could start cutting rates in the summer. The pace of US economic growth slowed in the last three months of 2023, but far less than had been expected, underlining the continued resilience of the economy. Growth slowed to an annualised rate of 3.3% from 4.9% in the third quarter. The economy grew by 2.5% in 2023, its best performance since 2021. Lloyds Banking Group is cutting around 1,600 jobs across its branch network as it shifts more services online to save money. It will also create around 830 jobs elsewhere in the bank. Britain\u2019s next government faces some of the toughest tax and spending choices for generations as it will be forced to grapple with the impact of weak growth and high debt interest payments, a leading thinktank has said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned that Jeremy Hunt\u2019s much-predicted budget tax cuts risked being reversed or paid for by spending cuts, and urged the Conservative and Labour parties to \u201clevel\u201d with voters before polling day. Our other main stories: Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Bye! \u2013 JK The government and the Bank of England will press ahead with the design of a digital pound without pledging that a \u201cBritcoin\u201d will become available to the British public. Officials at the Bank and the Treasury said a consultation exercise last year showed there was an appetite for a new method of transferring money electronically. Responding to concerns that the Bank and the government would have access to users\u2019 personal data, officials said primary legislation would safeguard digital currency users in the same way bank accounts are protected at the moment. The Treasury said it would also maintain cash in circulation after a strong backlash from among the 50,000 respondents to the consultation, including MPs, who feared paper banknotes and coins would be phased out. More than 40 countries are understood to be pursuing the development of a digital currency that is expected to rival the crypto currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are valued on independent exchanges. Supporters of the scheme, which could be launched before the end of the decade with the Bank acting as the backstop or custodian of the new digital currency, said it will allow innovation in the UK financial services sector, keeping firms in financial centres across the UK at the forefront of a global market place. Critics, including members of the House of Lords economic affairs committee, have said they have \u201cyet to hear a convincing case\u201d for why the UK needs a central bank digital currency (CBDC), while some MPs asked whether the plan is \u201ca solution in search of a problem\u201d. Simon Youel, head of policy and advocacy at research and campaign group Positive Money, said the government needed to respond to the rise of private crypto currencies. The huge response to the consultation highlights the importance of a genuinely inclusive national conversation on the future of our money, which is presently facing a rapid privatisation as cash gets replaced by electronic bank money. Colin Finlayson, fixed income investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, says the ECB may have to start cutting rates earlier than the summer. The ECB kept policy unchanged at 4%, as widely expected. Although Ms Lagarde attempted to push back on the current market expectations of rate-cuts in the coming month, she did have to concede that both underlying inflation and inflation expectations have continued to fall. With the ECB current growth outlook characterised as having risks to the downside, the market paid little attention to her attempts to dampen rate-cut enthusiasm. The ECB are guiding towards the summer at the earliest for any rate cuts to begin but we feel that they may not have the luxury of waiting that long. On the Lloyds job cuts, here is a statement from the bank: As more customers choose to manage their day-to-day banking online, it\u2019s important our people are available when it matters most. We\u2019re introducing a number of new roles and making changes to our branch teams so our customers can see us how and when they want to. Lloyds is cutting 1,600 jobs as part of a shift to more online services but is also creating 830 jobs elsewhere \u2013 \u201cin an expanded relationship growth team \u2013 part of our consumer relationships business \u2013 where colleagues will work to understand our customers\u2019 financial goals and needs and meet them through our products and services\u201d. The Accord union explains the changes in detail on its website: There will be no compulsory role reductions at grades A and B, although grade B colleagues can express an interest in voluntary redundancy. Changes to management structures will mean there will be redundancies at grade C and above. The aim is to achieve most of these reductions through voluntary redundancy. Asked whether she stands by her forecast made in December that the eurozone will avoid recession, Lagarde said the most recent PMI surveys are encouraging for the economy. People can challenge PMI numbers and they do but at least we are seeing numbers that are either to the upside or or stable\u2026 We recognise the weakness of of growth and that weakness obviously applies to Q4. You know there are multiple ways to define what is a recession, the technical terminology, two quarters in a row that that are negative is one way to look at it. I remember discussing that with my colleague and friend Janet Yellen, where the US had two quarters in a row that were negative. And when I said well, Janet, you must be in a recession and she said: \u2018What! With those unemployment numbers, forget it. We are not in recession.\u2019 So I think we have to be attentive to all sorts of data signals and understanding of the economy. This concludes the press conference. Back at the ECB in Frankfurt, chief Christine Lagarde is asked whether her comments mean that a rate cut in April is unlikely. She said: In terms of an overall evaluation of our policy trajectory, which many of you are after, we need to be further along in the disinflation process before we can be sufficiently confident that inflation will actually hit the target in a timely manner and in a sustainable way at target. So it\u2019s a disinflation process in which we are, it is working, but we need to be more advanced. and we need to be further along in that process, to be confident that inflation will be at target sustainably. So I\u2019m giving you a little indication about what I call the trajectory, but it\u2019s not forward guidance, it\u2019s trying to give you the mechanics that we will apply in our considerations when we look at data in the next few weeks. Just in: Lloyds Banking Group is cutting around 1,600 jobs across its branch network as it shifts more services online to save money. It will also create around 830 jobs elsewhere in the bank. Banks are keen to cut costs amid tough economic conditions and pressure on profit margins from competition and peaking interest rates. Rival Barclays also slashed thousands of jobs last year, with the majority in the bank\u2019s back office support division. Lagarde also said the ECB is keeping a close eye on developments in the Red Sea, where attacks on ships by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have led to ships being rerouted, and concerns about shipping delays and higher costs, which could push inflation up. We are observing very carefully because we are seeing that shipping costs are increasing, delivery delays are increasing. And while we all know that there is more shipping capacity than there was in in 2020 and 2021, we also know that costs and fees are increasing. The Q&amp;A has started. The first question is whether the governing council discussed a rate cut at today\u2019s meeting. Lagarde said: The consensus around the table of the Governing Council was that it was premature to discuss rate cuts. One other thing, which was very much a consensus around the table was that we had to continue to be data dependent. Lagarde summed up the risks to inflation: Upside risks to inflation include the heightened geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term, and hamper global trade. Inflation could also turn out higher than anticipated if wage wages increase by more than expected or profit margins prove more resilient by contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampens demand by more than expected or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsens unexpectedly. Moreover, inflation could decline more quickly in the near term if energy prices evolve in line with the recent downward shift in market expectations of the future path for oil and gas prices. Turning to inflation, ECB president Christine Lagarde said: Inflation is expected to ease further over the course of this year as the effects of past energy shocks, supply bottlenecks and the post pandemic reopening of the economy fade and tighter monetary policy continues to weigh on demand. Almost all measures of underlying inflation declined further in December. The elevated rate of wage increases and falling labour productivity are keeping domestic price pressures high, although these two have started to ease. And the growth outlook: Looking now at the risk assessment, the risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. Growth could be lower if the effects of monetary policy turn out stronger than expected. A weaker world economy or a further slowdown in global trade would also weigh on euro area growth. Russia\u2019s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East are key sources of geopolitical risks. This may result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted. Growth could be higher if rising real incomes mean spending increases by more than anticipated or if the world economy grows more strongly than expected. The pace of US economic growth slowed in the last three months of 2023, but far less than had been expected, underlining the continued resilience of the economy. The commerce department reported on Thursday that US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of economic health \u2013 grew at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the final quarter of the year, down from 4.9% in the previous quarter but in line with pre-pandemic growth, and well ahead of the 2% economists had expected. Robust consumer spending and government outlays contributed to the growth. The Federal Reserve has been attempting to cool economic activity in order to bring down inflation. Since March 2022 the Fed has increased rates to a 22-year high and held them there. Inflation has fallen from a high of 9% in June 2022 to 3.4%. The rate rises have increased the cost of borrowing and many \u2013 including the Fed \u2013 had expected a subsequent slowdown in economic activity to lead to layoffs. But so far the Fed appears to be on course for what it has termed a \u201csoft landing\u201d. Hiring has remained robust \u2013 unemployment hovers at close to a 50-year low \u2013 and while growth has slowed, consumers have continued to spend, the US economy has weathered the rate rises and stock markets have hit record highs. \u201cThe Fed \u2013 so far \u2013 has managed to strangle inflation without strangling the economy,\u201d said Dan North, senior economist with Allianz Trade Americas. North said the Fed rate rises were still working their way through the economy and he expected 2024 to be a year of slow growth \u201cbut we are not using the recession word yet.\u201d European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde has kicked off the press conference with a statement on the economy. Looking at the economic activity, the euro area economy is likely to have stagnated in the final quarter of \u201823. The incoming data continue to signal weakness in the near term. However, some forward looking server indicators point to a pickup in growth further ahead. The labour market has remained robust. The unemployment rate at 6.4% in November has fallen back to its lowest level since the start of the euro and more workers have entered the labour force. The US economy expanded more than expected in the fourth quarter, powered by consumer spending. GDP rose at a 3.3% annualised rate, according to the government\u2019s preliminary estimate, down from 4.9% in the previous quarter. This compares with market forecasts of 2.2% growth. In 2023, the economy expanded by 2.5%, its strongest performance since 2021. ECB president Christine Lagarde will hold a press conference at 1.45pm GMT. You can watch it here. The European Central Bank\u2019s governing council has kept interest rates unchanged, as expected. The ECB\u2019s rate on its main refinancing operations, which provide the bulk of liquidity to the banking system, is at 4.5%. Its deposit rate, which is paid on commercial bank deposits, is at 4%. The marginal lending facility, which offers overnight credit to banks, is at 4.75%. The central bank explained: The incoming information has broadly confirmed its previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook. Aside from an energy-related upward base effect on headline inflation, the declining trend in underlying inflation has continued, and the past interest rate increases keep being transmitted forcefully into financing conditions. Tight financing conditions are dampening demand, and this is helping to push down inflation. Ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s interest rate decision at 1.15pm GMT, Germany\u2019s 10-year bond yield rose to its highest level since early December. Germany\u2019s 10-year yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, touched a high of 2.371% earlier. Yields move inversely to prices. The central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged but investors will be looking for any hints on when borrowing costs will start to come down. The ECB\u2019s deposit rate, which is paid on commercial bank deposits, was last raised in September to 4% \u2013 the highest since the euro was launched in 1999. The rate on its main refinancing operations, which provide the bulk of liquidity to the banking system, is at 4.5%. The marginal lending facility, which offers overnight credit to banks, is at 4.75%. Jeroen Blokland, founder of Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund, tweeted: On the markets, shares are drifting lower while oil prices have risen and the pound is little changed. The FTSE 100 index is trading 14 points, or 0.2%, lower at 7,513. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 0.4%, while France\u2019s CAC is down 0.45% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has slid nearly 1% ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s interest rate decision. In the oil market, Brent crude, the global benchmark, is $1.07 higher at $81.10 a barrel, a 1.3% gain. US light crude has gained $1.11 to $76.2 a barrel, up 1.5%. Oil prices rallied after data showed US crude stockpiles fell more than expected last week, and the Chinese central bank\u2019s cut in banks\u2019 reserve requirements (the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve) raised hopes of more economic stimulus to kickstart the economy. Retail sales across the UK fell at the fastest pace in three years this month, according to an industry survey. The Confederation of British Industry\u2019s monthly retail sales balance, which measures sales volumes versus a year ago, fell to -50 in January from -32 in December, the weakest since December 2021 when Britain was in a Covid-19 lockdown. The balance measures the number of retailers who said sales volumes rose minus those who said sales fell. February won\u2019t be much better, the survey suggests. The volume of sales for this time of the year was -47, the lowest reading since May 2020. Martin Sartorius, the CBI\u2019s principal economist, said: Looking ahead, demand conditions in the sector will remain challenging as higher interest rates continue to feed through to mortgage payments and household incomes. Official figures published last week showed British retailers suffered the biggest drop in sales for almost three years in December, raising the risk that the economy slipped into recession late last year. Domino\u2019s Pizza shares have dived, wiping more than $1.5bn from the company\u2019s market value. A trifecta of problems facing the international operations of Domino\u2019s Pizza Enterprises sparked a 30% plunge in the share price of the Australian-owned company on Thursday. Domino\u2019s, which holds the branding rights in several countries of the American pizza chain, disclosed that net profit before tax for the recent six-month period was expected to be between $87m and $90m, down from almost $105m a year earlier. The shareholder response to the trading update was ruthless. Managing director Don Meij convened a call with analysts and investors, and sought to explain the troubles. \u201cIt\u2019s quite humbling to sit in front of you and to be able to share the disappointing results in part of our business today,\u201d he said on the video conference. \u201cIt really shows a rollercoaster.\u201d Norway\u2019s central bank has kept its benchmark interest rate at 4.5%, as expected, and said the cost of borrowing was likely to stay at that level \u201cfor some time ahead\u201d. The economic prospects for Norway do not appear to have changed materially since December, Norges Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee said. Norges Bank\u2019s governor Ida Wolden Bache said: The committee assesses that the policy rate is now sufficiently high to return inflation to target within a reasonable time horizon. Monetary policy is having a tightening effect, and the economy is cooling down. At the same time, business costs have increased considerably in recent years, and continued high wage growth and the crown depreciation through 2023 will likely restrain disinflation. In December, the central bank raised rates in a surprise move, even though inflation had slowed. Norway\u2019s core inflation was 5.5% in December, a 15-month low, down from a peak of 7% last June, but still above the central bank\u2019s 2% target. Economists are expecting a rate cut between July and September and another one in the final three months of 2024, which would bring the benchmark rate down to 4% by the end of the year. In the UK, the bike and car parts retailer Halfords said sales in December were much weaker than in October and November. It explained that mild and wet weather affected demand for winter products and brought fewer people into its stores, while cash-strapped customers reined in spending in the run-up to Christmas. Sales of car products fell 15.3% in December, after averaging 10.2% in October and November on a like-for-like basis (at stores open at least a year). However in January sales growth returned to those levels as conditions normalised, Halfords said. Group revenues grew by 2% in the 13 weeks to 29 December. However, cycling and consumer tyres were \u201cperforming significantly worse than anticipated and have weakened in Q3\u201d. Sales of bikes and accessories slid 1.2% in the quarter. Halfords said it performed better than the cycling market as a whole, with kids bikes sales up 5% in December. Volumes in the cycling and consumer tyres markets are below pre-pandemic levels by 28% and 14% respectively. The company is cutting costs of \u00a335m this year, more than previously flagged, and announced a partnership with the specialist tyre distributor Bond International. Graham Stapleton, the chief executive, said: Trading in Q4 has begun strongly and we remain focused on everything that we can control, with a number of initiatives underway to achieve further efficiencies within the business, as well as investing in areas where we see real opportunities for future growth. In German manufacturing, business expectations improved but remained pessimistic. Order books continue to shrink, albeit less rapidly than at the end of the year. The business climate in the service sector clouded over considerably while in trade, the index fell to its lowest level since October 2022. In construction, the business climate index also continued to slide. In Germany, business confidence worsened in January, as Europe\u2019s biggest economy remains weak. The closely watched business climate index from the Munich-based Ifo institute fell to 85.2 from 86.3 in December. The institute\u2019s president Clemens Fuest said: Companies assessed their current situation as worse. Their expectations for the months ahead were also once again more pessimistic. The German economy is stuck in recession. Technically, Germany dodged a recession at the end of last year (defined by two or more consecutive quarters of contraction). In the final quarter of last year, the German economy shrank by 0.3%, compared with the previous quarter, when output flatlined. But the economy contracted by 0.3% in 2023 and is on track for its first two-year recession since the early 2000s amid the impact of higher energy costs and weaker industrial demand. The boss of the London estate agents Foxtons, Guy Gittins, hailed a \u201ctransformational year\u201d following a turnaround plan, as it reported higher overall revenues and profits, although revenues in its sales business continued to slide. Sales revenues fell by 14% last year from 2022 while the market slumped by 22%, according to Foxtons. It said it has gone into 2024 with an under-offer pipeline far ahead of last year and expects year-on-year sales revenue growth in the first quarter, and further growth through the year. Things have improved in recent weeks. The firm explained: Buyer demand has grown as mortgage rates have begun to normalise, with good levels of growth seen in recent weeks as the first mortgage products are released with rates below 4% since the September 2022 mini-budget. Any sustained reduction in interest rates is expected to spur significant further growth in buyer demand. Total revenues rose 5% to \u00a3147m last year while adjusted operating profit edged higher to \u00a314m from \u00a313.9m. Gittins, the chief executive, has invested in the lettings business, which makes up 70% of group revenues and grew by 16%, delivering more than \u00a3100m revenue for the first time. In bad news for tenants, \u201crents are expected to stabilise and remain at historically elevated levels.\u201d Gittins, who returned to Foxtons (where he started his career) in September 2022 after running rival Chestertons, said: 2023 has been a transformational year for Foxtons, following the implementation of a refreshed strategy and operational turnaround plan. We have delivered a year of market share growth and have ended the year with revenue and adjusted operating profit ahead of market expectations; our operational upgrades and investment in fee earners, training, data and brand, coupled with a return to driving innovation in the industry, are now consistently delivering material benefits to our competitiveness and market positioning, helping us to end 2023 as the UK\u2019s fastest growing large lettings and sales agency brand. Dr Martens has been hit by lower sales in the US, as cash-strapped consumers refused to splash out for Christmas. The British bootmaker said sales made directly to customers fell 3% in the three months to the end of December, its third quarter, and wholesale revenues tumbled 46%. Overall group revenues were down 18%. The company, which was founded in 1960 in Northamptonshire, is still expecting a decline of nearly 10% over the full year (\u201chigh single-digit percentage\u201d). Kenny Wilson, the chief executive, said: This was driven by a weak USA performance, as expected. Trading in the quarter was volatile and we saw a softer December in line with trends across the industry. Whilst the consumer environment remains challenging, we are taking action to continue to grow our iconic brand and invest in our business. Labour will use its sold-out business conference next week to unveil the party\u2019s City policy plans, the Guardian can reveal, as it tries to win over hundreds of UK executives before a general election. More than 500 bosses from across British finance will gather in London on 1 February for the event, where opposition leaders including Sir Keir Starmer, his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and the shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, plan to \u201cshowcase Labour\u2019s offer to business\u201d. The party is hoping that the conference \u2013 which sold out within two hours in the autumn \u2013 will demonstrate its \u201ccommitment to work hand in glove with the business community\u201d and will use it as an opportunity to reveal its business policy plans after two major industry reviews. The Guardian understands that will include Labour\u2019s much-anticipated strategy for the City and will detail how the party plans to harness the strength of the UK\u2019s \u00a3275bn financial and professional services sector. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial market and the world economy. The next UK government will face the toughest tax and spending decisions in 70 years, according to a leading think tank. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said a combination of high interest rates and weak growth means whoever wins the general election later this year will find it \u201cmore difficult to reduce debt as a fraction of national income than in any parliament since at least the 1950s.\u201d It warned that Jeremy Hunt\u2019s much-predicted budget tax cuts \u2013 he will unveil the budget on 6 March \u2013 risk being reversed or paid for by spending cuts, and urged the Conservative and Labour parties to \u201clevel\u201d with voters before polling day. Chinese stocks rallied after a cut in Chinese bank reserve requirements, releasing about a trillian yuan for lending (nearly \u00a3111bn). The Shanghai Composite rose 3%, after hitting a four-year low on Monday, and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was up 2% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei was little changed. Investors have been selling Chinese equities for months, amid worries about the sluggish economy and the country\u2019s property crisis. The European Central Bank is meeting today and will announce its interest rate decision at lunchtime. It is not expected to change its main interest rate of 4.5%. Minutes from the December meeting showed policymakers were pushing back on aggressive market expectations for rate cuts, and ECB president Christine Lagarde is likely to face questions on their timing during the press conference. Last week, she said the central bank could cut rates in the summer, during an interview with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

            "content": "The prospect of early interest rate cuts this year across leading industrialised nations received a blow on Thursday after figures showed the US economy grew at a faster pace than expected last year. A stronger than forecast increase in US gross domestic product (GDP) of 3.3% last year dented hopes in the US, while the European Central Bank hinted at delays to the first cut in the cost of borrowing. Meanwhile a strong start to the year by the UK economy appeared to give the Bank of England, which meets next week to decide its next move on interest rates, a reason to hold at the current level of 5.25% into the summer. After leaving interest rates unchanged on Thursday, the president of the ECB, Christine Lagarde, warned that it was \u201cpremature to discuss rate cuts\u201d as she insisted future decisions would depend on incoming data. Investors cut their forecasts for the total level of rate cuts by the ECB this year to 1.3 percentage points from 1.5 percentage points two weeks ago. The central bank said inflation across the eurozone was slowly trending downwards. But Lagarde added: \u201cWe need to be further along the disinflation process to be confident that inflation will be at target \u2013 sustainably so.\u201d Germany has fallen into recession and France has struggled to grow over the last year, prompting calls for interest rates cuts to boost economic growth. Michael Hewson, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, said: \u201cGermany is in an absolute hole with no prospect of getting out of it, and yet the ECB seem more worried about inflation than they are about a depression.\u201d The ECB expects household and government spending to drive recovery but figures from the economy appear to be painting a bleaker picture, with manufacturing remaining in recession and services cooling. Lagarde said cuts to government energy subsidies could weaken the eurozone further, though disruption to shipping in the Red Sea could send inflation higher, complicating the situation. Higher import and export costs, pushing up shop prices, could prevent the ECB from reacting to weakening growth by lowering borrowing costs. Next week, the US Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates. However, comments from Jerome Powell, chair of the central bank, will be intensely scrutinised to assess when the bank might begin reducing the burden on borrowers. Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, told Reuters: \u201cIt\u2019s only fitting that a year that defied expectations would show growth that exceeded expectations. You have to squint to see weakness in the numbers. What\u2019s not to like? \u201cThe problem for the market is that the Fed doesn\u2019t have to be in a hurry to cut. Rather than cutting sooner and faster, the Fed can cut later and slower.\u201d The US economy expanded by 3.3% in the last quarter of 2023, according to the annualised estimate for GDP, down from 4.9% in the previous quarter, but higher than expected by analysts."

            "date": "2024-01-17T23:20:21Z",
            "content": "Cyclone forecasting is getting a boost from artificial intelligence models that can predict the risks of these extreme weather events with increasing accuracy. Queenslanders told to be on alert by the Bureau of Meteorology for a second tropical cyclone to hit the state in just over a month now have extra ways to monitor the risks via online trackers predicting the potential path of the cyclone. As of Wednesday afternoon, the bureau was rating the possibility that a low pressure system in the Coral Sea would form into a cyclone as a 60% chance by next Tuesday. Should it form, the cyclone would be named Kirrily. Some models had the system turning towards the Queensland coast, said Daniel Hayes, a Cairns-based community information officer for the bureau. \u201cIf it moves back towards the coast, probably somewhere between Cairns and Rockhampton is the more likely area for it to head towards,\u201d Hayes said, adding, \u201cit\u2019s not expected to have any direct impact on the coast within the next seven days\u201d. It is too early for the bureau to issue a forecast track for the tempest. There is, though, \u201ca chance that it could actually intensify to become a severe tropical cyclone, which is category three or stronger\u201d, he said. Category 3 storms have mean wind speeds of 118km/h to 159km/h. Other weather agencies, such as the well-regarded European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) has a clear cyclone forming by next Friday. However, forecasting generated by machine learning is increasingly available to the public, including via the European centre itself. Its Artificial Intelligence/Integrated Forecasting System (AIFS) model, for instance, has cyclone Kirrily nearing the Queensland coast much closer to Rockhampton than Cairns by late next Thursday. The ECMWF launched its experimental model last October and also carries several other versions on its website produced using AI technology, such as by Google\u2019s GraphCast and China\u2019s Huawei Pangu model. The centre said the more traditional physics-based numerical weather prediction models, such as its Integrated Forecasting System, remain \u201cstill key\u201d to its predictions. One reason is the numerical models provide the initial conditions and the training datasets that the machine-learning versions work from. Also, the AI models are based on single calculations, not the multiple calculations that produce the ensemble of results that the ECMWF would rely on to produce probability maps for cyclones. Guardian Australia approached the bureau for comment. The bureau\u2019s own Access model shows the system remaining well off the coast by Tuesday. Jyoteeshkumar Reddy Papari, a postdoctoral researcher at the Csiro, said it remained \u201chard to more precisely predict the tropical cyclone (TC) track a week out even with the AI models\u201d. \u201cOverall, the AI model is doing a reasonably good job in spinning the [tropical cyclone] and providing the possible track as good as the dynamical model,\u201d Papari said. Still, \u201cpeople should be cautious about the possibility of [tropical cyclone] landfall [and] should take the official warnings\u201d from official agencies such as the bureau. Nevertheless, \u201cthey are useful guides to what\u2019s coming\u201d, he said. \u201cWe can expect more AI weather models even with ensemble-style forecasts and [they will] become more accessible to the public.\u201d Other models are throwing up a variety of tracks for the cyclone, such as the US\u2019s Global Ensemble Forecast System. Scientists working for Google\u2019s DeepMind division last year published a peer-reviewed paper in the journal Science stating their GraphCast machine learning-based model had outperformed the most accurate operational systems on 90% of 1,380 targets. Its forecasts also supported \u201cbetter severe event prediction including tropical cyclone tracking, atmospheric rivers and extreme temperates\u201d, the researchers said."

            "content": "Kerry Plowright had his feet up and was watching TV one evening late last year when his phone warned of incoming hail. \u201cI was stunned when I walked out the door because there was just this roar,\u201d he says, describing the sound of hailstones hitting roofs in the New South Wales town of Kingscliff. He had just enough time to move his cars under canvas sails, sparing them from damage. Plowright isn\u2019t alone in having little warning before wild weather during Australia\u2019s seemingly relentless summer of extremes. This season may include a second tropical cyclone to strike Queensland. The Albanese government has launched an inquiry into warnings issued by the Bureau of Meteorology and emergency authorities after complaints by councils and others that some alerts lacked accuracy and timeliness. But Plowright\u2019s case is a little different \u2013 his hail heads-up was triggered by data generated by his own firm, Early Warning Network. Early Warning Network analyses data from radars and remote sensors to detect and issue alerts on extreme heat, rainfall and flooding. It counts local councils and big insurers among its customers. Private businesses have long offered services based on data from BoM or agencies such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). But Early Warning Network is starting to test artificial intelligence models that promise to make a lot more weather information available both rapidly and at low cost. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cYou have to pay a bucket load for [ECMWF] data,\u201d Plowright says. \u201cWe don\u2019t need now a supercomputer to go and run a forecast that will be extremely accurate up to 10 days, especially for extreme weather.\u201d Artificial intelligence \u201cis going to be absolutely phenomenal with weather and ultimately climate too, once it gets there\u201d, he predicts. How AI can help us prepare for weather extremes Juliette Murphy, a water resources engineer, is similarly excited. She founded FloodMapp to give communities more time to prepare after monitoring devastating floods in Queensland\u2019s Lockyer region in 2011 and then in the Canadian city of Calgary two years later. FloodMapp uses machines that learn from each model run as well as traditional physics-based hydrology and hydraulic models. Even relatively basic computers can comb through \u201creally large datasets\u201d quickly to identify likely effects of a flood, she says. Her clients include Queensland\u2019s fire and emergency services. Its results complement BoM\u2019s, helping authorities decide which homes to evacuate and which roads to close. \u201cThat\u2019s important not least because almost half of flood deaths involve people in cars,\u201d Murphy says. A BoM spokesperson says the bureau had been \u201cproactively and safely engaging with artificial intelligence capabilities for several years\u201d. \u201cThis area of research is one of many initiatives the bureau actively pursues to improve its services to government, emergency management partners and the community,\u201d she says. Justin Freeman, a computer scientist, ran BoM\u2019s research team which was working on machine learning before he left in in late 2022 to set up his own firm, Flowershift. Flowershift is building a geospatial model trained on existing observational data. \u201cWe would be filling in gaps around what the current forecast products are\u201d, such as providing forecasts in remote regions of Australia or beyond, Freeman says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more flexibility to be able to explore things [outside BoM] and use technologies which are very new,\u201d says Freeman, who still does contract work for the bureau. \u201cWe\u2019ve got this whole new different class of models which are completely different to what [the bureau had] been running for the last 50 years.\u201d There are many potential uses for models that can analyse data cheaply and then supply localised information. Farmers, for instance, could ask, \u201cShould I spray my crops this week?\u201d and be told why or why not, Freeman says. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been that long that we\u2019ve had access to something like ChatGPT,\u201d he says. \u201cLook forward like another two years, five years \u2013 it\u2019s just going to accelerate and get better and better.\u201d The limitations of AI Some BoM and climate researchers, though, caution how much AI-based models, such Google\u2019s GraphCast or Nvidia\u2019s FourCastNet, can improve on numerical models that churn out a range of probabilities. \u201cFor \u2018simple\u2019 weather forecasting and for downscaling physical model data I reckon [there\u2019s] massive potential,\u201d one bureau scientist says. \u201cFor warning us of real dangers when the atmosphere gets violent, I\u2019d be very cautious. \u201cAnd with climate change, we need to better understand things that are well outside the norm.\u201d Sanaa Hobeichi, a post-doctoral researcher at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, says there are still benefits despite the limitations. Existing climate models typically offer only \u201ccoarse\u201d resolutions, such as estimating rainfall changes over areas 150km by 150km. In Sydney, for instance, a model that size would capture the city, mountains and a lot besides and so be of limited use. Google\u2019s GraphCast forecast model has a resolution down to 28km by 28km, while Hobeichi says some AI can model just 5km by 5km. A challenge, though, is that machine-learning techniques inherit and potentially extrapolate imperfections of the traditional models they train on. Jyoteeshkumar Reddy Papari, a post-doctoral CSIRO researcher, notes that the ECMWF was initially sceptical of AI but has lately started its own experimental model. It is also displaying several others on its website, including Google\u2019s. \u201cCountries that don\u2019t have good meteorological organisations are relying on these machine learning models because they are super easy to learn and are publicly available,\u201d he says. \u201cSo some of the African countries are using these forecasts.\u201d Google researchers last year claimed GraphCast \u201csignificantly outperforms the most accurate\u201d operational systems in 90% of 1380 targets. Tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers and extreme temperatures were predictions it made which were better than traditional models and improvements are ongoing. \u201cOne particular example we often mention was Hurricane Lee, because it was the first time that we observed in real time how GraphCast was predicting a hurricane trajectory that originally differed from the traditional systems, and eventually was shown to be the right trajectory,\u201d said Alvaro Sanchez-Gonzalez, a Goggle researcher. \u201cIt was detected in real time and it was verified by independent sources.\u201d Current tracking of the potential cyclone in the Coral Sea \u2013 to be named Kirrily if it forms as expected by Monday \u2013 will also be monitored to see how models compare. ECMWF\u2019s machine learning coordinator, Matthew Chantry, says AI models are \u201ca very exciting avenue as a companion system for traditional forecasting\u201d although the latter retains some advantages. \u201cTropical cyclone intensity estimates are a good example,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an open question whether these flaws are maintained as the technology matures \u2013 it is still very early days.\u201d Authorities act based on the probabilities calculated by traditional models but that needs a very large supercomputer. \u201cWith AI forecasts, this is dramatically reduced, with some estimates suggesting a 1000-times reduction in the energy to make a forecast. Cheaper systems could therefore be a force for equality. \u201cThis reduced cost could also be invested into larger ensembles, meaning that we have a better idea of low-probability but extreme events that could occur.\u201d And as for predicting effects of a heating planet? \u201cThe problem is significantly harder than weather forecasting, with less data,\u201d says Chantry. \u201cThat said, in a changing climate, where evidence suggests an increase in extreme events, then any help with predicting these events has significant value.\u201d"

            "content": "Artificial intelligence, combined with wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, is fuelling a boom in fraud on dating and social media apps, officials at Europol have said. Speaking to the Guardian, the agency\u2019s top financial crime experts said scripts generated by artificial intelligence enable criminals to target multiple victims at once. Sebastian Bley, the head of the Europol economic crime team in The Hague, said: \u201cThere is a trend of more and more cases of people saying \u2018I\u2019m a doctor in a war zone\u2019 and asking for funds to be transferred out of that zone. They say they also need to get the family out.\u201d Burkhard M\u00fchl, the overall head of the financial and economic crime unit at Europol, said: \u201cIt can involve tens of thousands of euros in one case.\u201d They also warned of a rise in \u201cbogus boss\u201d scams, with fraudsters spinning an elaborate web of fake websites, fake CVs and investor profiles to target a gamut of victims ranging from personal investors to tax authorities. The impact can be devastating, resulting in the loss of life savings and in some cases suicide. The EU\u2019s law enforcement agency, whose mission is to prevent and combat international and organised crime, analyses trends in fraud. It said AI is making it easier for scammers to increase their success rate, and there is an increase of \u201cabuse using large language tools like ChatGPT,\u201d M\u00fchl said. \u201cWith large language tools you can write thousands of tailored messages in different languages with different targets, different stories, and you can do that with your laptop from wherever,\u201d he added. The rise in dating fraud comes less than two years after a Netflix documentary, The Tinder Swindler, brought global attention to a man who posed as the son of a wealthy diamond mogul and conned several women out of money, one losing nearly \u20ac250,000 (\u00a3215,000) in loans. No matter how compelling their story is, \u201cnever send money to a person you haven\u2019t personally met\u201d, M\u00fchl said. Bley and M\u00fchl spoke of the devastating consequences and in some cases \u201crevictimisation\u201d, when fraudulent financial advisers offered help to get money back. \u201cPeople sometimes lose the life savings, investing in all kinds of products. We don\u2019t have statistics really drilling into those questions in detail but we hear from our investigators about cases that are quite dramatic \u2013 people jumping out of the window because they lost pension savings in investment schemes,\u201d M\u00fchl said. The best solution is reporting the crime to the police, Bley and M\u00fchl said, but they believe investor fraud is underreported because of the shame people feel. \u201cIt\u2019s not only the financial damage that hits the victims. It is also psychological damage,\u201d M\u00fchl added. General investor fraud through text message scams is said to have risen by 40% in the UK since the launch of ChatGPT, according to British authorities. AI is bringing previously unseen economies of scale to the world of fraud, Bley said. He added that traditional fraud takes a lot of time to make things up and lure victims into a drawn-out narrative until they establish trust. AI can cut this out, with industrial-scale fishing for victims possible. \u201cIf you personally meet somebody, you have to invest a lot of time making things up and to find the right victim,\u201d Bley said. \u201cOnline, it\u2019s easier to target a lot of people once you have feedback from somebody on the platform, something to continue with engagement. If you see it\u2019s not going to go anywhere you just turn to the next one. It\u2019s much easier to approach people.\u201d Europol said it believed Europe was being targeted by criminals operating outside the EU because of the \u201chigh standards of living\u201d and because \u201cpeople have money to invest\u201d. Last year authorities in India busted a bitcoin racket being operated out of a call centre in Delhi that was targeting Austrians. Fraudsters posed as Interpol investigators and called Austrians to advise them they were the subject of police investigations but if they went to a bitcoin ATM to exchange cash the inquiries would end. In a recent \u201cbogus boss\u201d case, criminals managed to steal \u20ac50m from a variety of companies and \u201cmajor corporations that you would not consider to be victims\u201d, M\u00fchl said. The criminals were \u201cvery clever\u201d, learned about company structures, set up fake websites and somehow were able to get in touch with investors, offering them \u201cdiscount\u201d shares."

            "content": "The developer OpenAI has said it would be impossible to create tools like its groundbreaking chatbot ChatGPT without access to copyrighted material, as pressure grows on artificial intelligence firms over the content used to train their products. Chatbots such as ChatGPT and image generators like Stable Diffusion are \u201ctrained\u201d on a vast trove of data taken from the internet, with much of it covered by copyright \u2013 a legal protection against someone\u2019s work being used without permission. Last month, the New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft, which is a leading investor in OpenAI and uses its tools in its products, accusing them of \u201cunlawful use\u201d of its work to create their products. In a submission to the House of Lords communications and digital select committee, OpenAI said it could not train large language models such as its GPT-4 model \u2013 the technology behind ChatGPT \u2013 without access to copyrighted work. \u201cBecause copyright today covers virtually every sort of human expression \u2013 including blogposts, photographs, forum posts, scraps of software code, and government documents \u2013 it would be impossible to train today\u2019s leading AI models without using copyrighted materials,\u201d said OpenAI in its submission, first reported by the Telegraph. It added that limiting training materials to out-of-copyright books and drawings would produce inadequate AI systems: \u201cLimiting training data to public domain books and drawings created more than a century ago might yield an interesting experiment, but would not provide AI systems that meet the needs of today\u2019s citizens.\u201d Responding to the NYT lawsuit in a blog post published to its website on Monday, OpenAI said: \u201cWe support journalism, partner with news organisations, and believe the New York Times lawsuit is without merit.\u201d Previously, the company said it respected \u201cthe rights of content creators and owners\u201d. AI companies\u2019 defence of using copyrighted material tends to lean on the legal doctrine of \u201cfair use\u201d, which allows use of content in certain circumstances without seeking the owner\u2019s permission. In its submission, OpenAI said it believed that \u201clegally, copyright law does not forbid training\u201d. The NYT lawsuit has followed numerous other legal complaints against OpenAI. John Grisham, Jodi Picoult and George RR Martin were among 17 authors who sued OpenAI in September alleging \u201csystematic theft on a mass scale\u201d. Getty Images, which owns one of the largest photo libraries in the world, is suing the creator of Stable Diffusion, Stability AI, in the US and in England and Wales for alleged copyright breaches. In the US, a group of music publishers including Universal Music are suing Anthropic, the Amazon-backed company behind the Claude chatbot, accusing it of misusing \u201cinnumerable\u201d copyrighted song lyrics to train its model. Elsewhere in its House of Lords submission, in response to a question about AI safety, OpenAI said it supported independent analysis of its security measures. The submission said it backed \u201cred-teaming\u201d of AI systems, where third-party researchers test the safety of a product by emulating the behaviour of rogue actors. OpenAI is among the companies that have agreed to work with governments on safety testing their most powerful models before and after their deployment, after an agreement struck at a global safety summit in the UK last year."

            "content": "Since generative AI exploded into global consciousness in 2023, an unprecedented demand for computing power has emerged alongside the demand for apps utilising the technology. Tool\u2019s like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT require thousands of Nvidia GPUs (graphics processing units) to smoothly process all the information being fed in and output. Nvidia last week compared GPUs to rare earth metals for AI, saying they\u2019re \u201cfoundational\u201d for the operation of generative AI today. The energy required to power all this hardware is the equivalent of a small country, according to a report released by French energy company Schneider Electric last year. On Wednesday OpenAI\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman, told an audience at Davos that an energy breakthrough was needed to power AI advances. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to get there without a breakthrough,\u201d he said, suggesting it was motivation for investing more in nuclear fusion. Fortune Business Insights estimated earlier this year the global GPU market size was valued at US$2.39bn in 2022 and is projected to grow from US$3.16bn in 2023 to US$25.53bn by 2030. Nvidia claims more than 40,000 companies use Nvidia GPUs for AI and accelerated computing. To meet the demand, Nvidia announced in August it would be tripling its production of GPUs. In November, Microsoft signed a multi-year deal with Oracle to supply computing power for its Bing Chat AI functionality. Now companies that once serviced the boom in cryptocurrency mining are pivoting to take advantage of the latest data gold rush. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Canadian company Hive Blockchain changed its name in July to Hive Digital Technologies and announced it was pivoting to AI. \u201cHive has been a pioneering force in the cryptocurrency mining sector since 2017. The adoption of a new name signals a significant strategic shift to harness the potential of GPU Cloud compute technology, a vital tool in the world of AI, machine learning and advanced data analysis, allowing us to expand our revenue channels with our Nvidia GPU fleet,\u201d the company said in its announcement at the time. The company\u2019s executive chairman, Frank Holmes, told Guardian Australia the transition required a lot of work. \u201cMoving from mining Ethereum to hosting GPU cloud services involves buying powerful new servers for our GPUs, upgrading networking equipment and moving to higher tier data centres,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only commonality is that GPUs are the workhorses in both cases. GPU cloud requires higher end supporting hardware and a more secure, faster data centre environment. There\u2019s a steep learning curve in the GPU cloud business, but our team is adapting well and learning fast.\u201d For others, like Iris Energy, a datacentre company operating out of Canada and Texas, and co-founded by Australian Daniel Roberts, it has been the plan all along. Iris did not require any changes to the way the company operated when the AI boom came along, Roberts told Guardian Australia. \u201cOur strategy really has been about bootstrapping the datacentre platform with bitcoin mining, and then just preserve optionality on the whole digital world. The distinction with us and crypto-miners is we\u2019re not really miners, we\u2019re datacentre people.\u201d The company still trumpets its bitcoin mining capability but in the most recent results Iris said it was well positioned for \u201cpower dense computing\u201d with 100% renewable energy. Roberts said it wasn\u2019t an either-or situation between bitcoin mining and AI. \u201cI think when you look at bitcoin versus AI, the market will just reach equilibrium based on the market-based demands for each product,\u201d he said. \u201cSo bitcoin\u2019s in demand as a store of value, gold 2.0\u2026 it\u2019ll go up, it will command an economic incentive to secure it. \u201cConversely, AI as adoption grows there, people will be willing to pay for that. And then for us, we\u2019ve got the optionality to pivot between the two and optimise on a path-dependent basis.\u201d Holmes said Hive also saw the two industries operating in parallel. \u201cWe love the bitcoin mining business, but its revenue is rather unpredictable. GPU cloud services should complement it well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe revenue should be steadier, but still offer attractive margins and the opportunity for rapid growth.\u201d Despite what had been declared a \u201ccrypto winter\u201d in 2023, the value of bitcoin reached a two-year high of US$49,061 on 11 January, after the US securities regulator approved the first US-listed exchange traded funds (ETF) to track bitcoin. It dipped back below US$40,000 this week. As with cryptocurrency mining, the massive computing power required by AI systems means massive amounts of energy and carbon emissions for some of the centres. AI companies like OpenAI keep their carbon emission figures a secret, but it has been estimated that the training of the previous iteration of GPT, GPT-3, consumed 1,287 megawatt hours of electricity and generated 552 tonnes of CO2 \u2013 the equivalent of 123 fossil-fuel-powered cars driven for one year. Iris Energy views its use of renewables not just as better for the environment, but a cost saver. \u201cWe have gone to the source of low-cost excess renewables where we\u2019ve gotten an abundance of land and an abundance of power,\u201d Roberts said. \u201c[At our] Texas site, we\u2019ve got a 600-megawatt grid connection into an area where there\u2019s 32 gigawatts of wind and solar. And the transmission line is 12 gigawatts to export that down to Dallas and Houston.\u201d While there is much hype, some are viewing the shift in the market with a level of scepticism, suggesting some might be jumping from one fad to the next. Institutional Investor reported in August that a \u201cpenny stock\u201d company known as Applied Sciences had reinvented itself as a bitcoin miner hosting company in April 2022 as Applied Bitcoin, but by November 2022 \u2013 perhaps sensing the shift in investment \u2013 renamed itself Applied Digital with a focus on AI."

            "date": "2024-01-26T15:39:02Z",
            "content": "Finland\u2019s leading presidential candidate has said foreign policy and security are \u201cexistential\u201d issues for the Nordic country, as it prepares to head to the polls for the first time since joining Nato. Speaking on Friday at a breakfast event in Helsinki two days before Finland\u2019s presidential election at a cafe named after him, Alexander Stubb, who was prime minister from 2014 to 2015, said he had thought he was finished with national politics. But Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine had changed his mind. Debates between the nine candidates hoping to take over from Finland\u2019s two-term president Sauli Niinist\u00f6 in March had been \u201cvery constructive\u201d, said Stubb, of the centre-right National Coalition party. He said all candidates were qualified for the role. He remains the frontrunner but polls have recently tightened between the top three candidates. Stubb\u2019s lead over the former foreign minister and Green candidate Pekka Haavisto has slimmed and Jussi Halla-aho, of the far-right Finns party, is catching up in third. The top two candidates will move to an expected second round. Stubb, 55, said: \u201cThe debates have been very constructive, and there\u2019s a reason for that. For Finland, foreign policy, security policy, is existential, so it\u2019s very consensual.\u201d Discussions have centred around foreign policy, the president\u2019s role as commander-in-chief and the candidates\u2019 values. \u201cSo you get a lot of questions about Russia, Ukraine, Gaza, US-China, US elections, Finnish Nato membership,\u201d he added. After eight years in government \u2013 as highlighted by his campaign posters, which are emblazoned with the figure in a big yellow font \u2013 Stubb said his return had been spurred by Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion. \u201cHaving been in government for eight consecutive years and having held all the key portfolios, I felt in 2016 that I had very much done it for God and country, as they say. My plan was not to return to politics, or certainly not to national politics \u2026 but Putin\u2019s attack on Ukraine changed it.\u201d After joining Nato at record speed last April, he believes Finland is entering \u201ca new age in Finnish foreign policy\u201d. \u201cWhen it became evident, right at the beginning of the war, that our path towards the alliance would begin, I felt strongly that this is a new age in Finnish foreign policy and perhaps I could throw my hat into the ring once again.\u201d Stubb said he was approaching the campaign like an endurance event, with preparations that started six months ago. \u201cNow we\u2019re in race season,\u201d he added. \u201cA couple of more days to go. I\u2019ve visited 120 different towns and cities, I\u2019ve given about 170, plus or minus, interviews, we\u2019ve had 44 public debates, televised or streamed. So we [the candidates] know each other\u2019s jokes quite well.\u201d He said he followed a \u201ctrinity of nutrition, rest and exercise\u201d to maximise his energy levels and had taken an ice bath before Thursday\u2019s televised debate. \u201cI go and take an ice bath and go straight into the studio. So I\u2019m full of beans when the debates begin,\u201d he said. The strengthening of the Finns party before the first round vote had added an extra dimension to the campaign. Hanna Wass, a vice-dean at the faculty of social sciences at the University of Helsinki, said that, as a result of broad consensus between candidates on security policy, Russia and Ukraine, the context of the election consolidated early on in campaigning. But despite this, she added, the Finns party, which earlier this year was elected into the Finnish government\u2019s ruling coalition, was increasingly grabbing the public\u2019s attention and creating a polarising atmosphere. \u201cThe Finns party once again showed its ability to twist the electoral agenda by activating themes related to socio-cultural issues or even nativism, as well as playing with the narrative that national media hold systematic bias against them, demonstrated, for instance, by reluctance to publish polls showing gains for Halla-aho.\u201d This, she said, could open up a push for tactical voting to prevent Halla-aho from making the second round. On the streets of Helsinki many appeared undecided about who to vote for. Yacquub Moalim Ali, 28, a consultant from Helsinki, said he was still making up his mind \u2013 probably choosing between either Li Andersson of the Left Alliance or Stubb \u2013 but he definitely would not be voting for Halla-aho. \u201cIf you go through his comments it\u2019s really brutal to read as a son of immigrant parents,\u201d he said."

            "content": "David Erlacher hadn\u2019t made up his mind about who he was going to caucus for when he showed up to a Cedar Rapids brewery to hear Ron DeSantis speak on Sunday afternoon. But inside his jacket pocket was a handwritten list of issues that mattered most to him. At the top was the economy, followed by the southern border. He then listed a series of foreign policy conflicts, including the Houthi attacks in Yemen, the war in Israel and the war between Ukraine and Russia. \u201cThe world\u2019s a dumpster fire right now,\u201d Erlacher, a 76-year-old retiree who lives in Cedar Rapids, said. \u201cWe got to try and find some water to throw on it. I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s gonna happen. I\u2019m just glad there\u2019s smarter people than myself out there to do it.\u201d Those three priorities \u2013 the economy, the border and international instability \u2013 echoed what many Iowa voters said were their top issues as they prepare to caucus in the US\u2019s first nominating contest on Monday, with Donald Trump, Nikki Haley and DeSantis at the top. A November Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll found that 81% of likely caucus-goers listed the economy as a \u201cvery important issue\u201d and 80% of caucus-goers listed \u201cimmigration and border security as \u201cvery important issues\u201d in the same poll. Concerns over the economy underscore a significant challenge for Joe Biden as he seeks a second term. Traditional metrics have shown that the US economy is strong, but nearly two-thirds of Americans are unhappy with it, according to a September Harris survey conducted by the Guardian. Kevin Hochstedler, 65, who works in home construction in Iowa City, was one of several voters who said his top issues were \u201cnumber one the economy, number two, southern border\u201d. Hochstedler, who plans to caucus for Haley, said he had seen a huge slowdown in his industry. He blamed the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates too quickly. \u201cThe economy is slowing, slowing, slowing, it\u2019s like a giant sucking sound,\u201d Hochstedler said at a Saturday event for Haley. Hochstedler was one of several voters who said they were outraged by Biden\u2019s handling of migrants at the US-Mexico border. He said he supported the state of Texas in an ongoing dispute with the Biden administration over policing the border. \u201cIf I were governor of Texas, I\u2019d call in the national guard, block it all off and keep the people in Mexico.\u201d \u201cThe border, it\u2019s a shame, it\u2019s despicable,\u201d said Carrie Fitzpatrick, 64, a home health worker in Cedar Rapids, said as she finished a beer at DeSantis\u2019s brewery event (she plans to caucus for him on Monday). \u201cIf I was down south, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do.\u201d Both Haley and DeSantis spoke to those concerns during their final stretch of campaign events headed into the caucuses. \u201cWhen I\u2019m president we\u2019re gonna clean house. Day one, we\u2019ll declare the border to be a national emergency. We\u2019re going to mobilize all resources, stop the invasion,\u201d DeSantis said in Cedar Rapids. \u201cWe\u2019re $34tn in debt, we\u2019re having to borrow money just to make our interest payments,\u201d Haley said in Iowa City on Friday. \u201cWhen it comes to the border, it truly is a dereliction of duty. I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re watching what\u2019s happening in America right now.\u201d \u201cI believe he will seal the border. And I think he will keep us out of wars and places we don\u2019t need to be,\u201d Scott Bates, a volunteer for the DeSantis campaign, said on Saturday in West Des Moines. The former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson, who registered the support of 1% of caucus-goers on the final final NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll held a town hall in Des Moines on Saturday evening and entertained questions on a range of issues including rebuilding trust in government, gun control and concerns about democracy. Meanwhile, while Biden and Democrats are likely to make abortion a key issue in the generation election, it was lower on the list of priorities in Iowa. \u201cI would say a lot of the social policies are important, but I think that the economy and foreign policy trump those things,\u201d Abbey Sindt, who is \u201cfairly certain\u201d she\u2019s backing Haley, said in Ames on Sunday. James Stone, 71, a retired technician from Cedar Rapids, said he would have preferred that the status quo that existed under Roe v Wade was still in effect. \u201cI mean I feel for babies, but I think in all practicality it seems to have worked for a long time.\u201d Stone said he initially supported Chris Christie, but now will probably caucus for DeSantis, who signed a six-week abortion ban into law as governor and has said he supports a 15-week abortion ban. Amy Christen, 56, a special education teacher in Cedar Rapids backing DeSantis, said education was one of her top concerns. \u201cMy biggest thing is education. I want kids to be educated and not indoctrinated. I\u2019m tired of all the stuff they\u2019re trying to push through. I want kids to be able to compete in the real world with, like, intelligence,\u201d she said. She added that she initially supported Donald Trump, because had since soured on him. \u201cMy thought was OK, the economy was great, and maybe he could bring it back again. But then he hasn\u2019t learned to keep his mouth shut when it should be. It would just be chaos again and I don\u2019t want that.\u201d Joan E Greve contributed reporting from Ames and Chris Stein contributed reporting from West Des Moines"

            "content": "One of the EU\u2019s most senior diplomats has criticised the Israeli foreign minister for not properly engaging with a summit in Brussels designed to pave the way for a peace plan in the Middle East. Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs, told reporters Israel Katz had come to the meeting to present plans for an artificial island off the coast of Gaza and a railway to India, concepts that had nothing to do with the peace talks. Borrell said: \u201cWe had had the pleasure of watching two very interesting videos, one about an artificial island project to serve as a port \u2026 and another one about a project to build a railroad line linking the Middle East with India, which also seemed to us to be very interesting. \u201cI think the minister could have made better use of his time to worry about the security of his country and the high number of deaths in the Middle East and the high death toll in Gaza.\u201d The EU foreign policy chief has said he is determined to pursue a two-state solution in the Middle East, whether Israel is ready to participate or not. \u201cPeace is a very general objective, nobody would say they are against peace; in our view we should stop talking about peace in the Middle East but talk about specifics, about the two-state solution,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Israel does not want the solution, it is going to be difficult for them to take part \u2026 but it does not stop others taking part.\u201d His remarks came a day after the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, reaffirmed a hard line against the establishment of any Palestinian state on the grounds it would pose \u201can existential danger\u201d to Israel. Alluding to Israel\u2019s stated objective of annihilating Hamas in its three-month-old war in the Gaza Strip, Borrell told reporters: \u201cWhat are the other solutions they have in mind? Make all the Palestinians leave? Kill all of them? \u2026 The way they are destroying Hamas is not the way to do it. They are sealing the hate for generations.\u201d Katz, and his Palestinian counterpart, Riyad al-Maliki, made separate appearances at the monthly gathering of EU foreign ministers, which was also being attended by counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan, and the Arab League secretary general. Katz came to the conference asking for the EU to renew focus on the fight to free the estimated 130 people who were seized on 7 October by Hamas and remain hostages. \u201cOur brave soldiers are fighting in very hard conditions for those two aims: to bring back our hostages and restore security for the citizens of Israel,\u201d he said in a brief statement before attending the summit. The talks centred on a 12-point discussion paper about establishing a two-state solution. Netanyahu has sought to obstruct the establishment of a Palestinian state throughout his political career. Nevertheless, his rejection of any moves to establish a state when Israel ends its offensive against Gaza caused consternation and represented his sharpest rebuttal yet of US and EU foreign policy. EU foreign ministers lined up to denounce the Israeli leader as they arrived at the Brussels summit. The Irish foreign minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin, said Netanyahu\u2019s insistence there would be no two-state solution was unacceptable while St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, France\u2019s new foreign and European affairs minister, described his remarks as worrying. \u201cAll those who say they don\u2019t want to hear about such a solution have not brought any alternative,\u201d the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said. The Jordanian foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, told reporters the war could no longer continue and that a two-state solution was the \u201conly path\u201d. \u201cWe have engaged in over 30 years of process and look where that has got us,\u201d Safadi said, referring to intermittent Israeli-Palestinian peace talks since the 1990s. \u201cA moment of truth is upon us. Do we allow a radical racist agenda to dictate the future or come together and say the path is clear, we want peace for everybody?\u201d The EU paper does not offer any solutions or details but suggests that at a future peace conference participants should spell out \u201cconsequences\u201d for both sides, depending on whether they accept or reject a plan approved by the gathering. It does not say what these consequences might be, although the EU has some areas of potential leverage. The bloc is a major provider of economic aid to Palestinians and has a broad cooperation agreement with Israel that includes a free-trade area. Some officials have privately suggested the latter arrangement could be used to influence Israel."

Borrell\u2019s meeting with Raad came hours after Hezbollah fired a barrage of rockets at an Israeli military base on Saturday in response to the killing of Saleh al-Arouri, a senior Hamas official, earlier this week. Israel has not claimed responsibility. Here are some images coming through the newswires from Tel Aviv this evening, where thousands of demonstrators, including families of hostages held by Hamas, rallied against the Israeli government over its handling of the hostage crisis and its ongoing war in Gaza: The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has landed in Jordan, according to the US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller. \u201cJordan is a vital partner in helping to prevent the conflict in the region from spreading, and we are grateful for their leadership in facilitating aid to civilians in Gaza,\u201d he added.

The humanitarian organization went on to report that a bullet heavily penetrated a wall in the hospital\u2019s ICU unit on Friday. \u201cOver the last couple of days, drone attacks and snipers fire were just a few hundred metres from the hospital,\u201d Lopez said, adding: \u201cThe situation became so dangerous that some staff living in the neighbouring areas were not able to leave their houses because of the constant threats of drones and snipers.\u201d Lopez went on to urge Israel to abide by international humanitarian law amid its war on Gaza, which has destroyed numerous health facilities, saying: We reiterate that Israel has an obligation under international humanitarian law to protect patients and staff who are still working in the only functioning hospital in Gaza\u2019s middle area. An Israeli airstrike on a house belonging to the Al-Nabris family in Khan Younis killed several Palestinians while wounding dozens on Saturday, Palestinian health officials said, according to Reuters.

The Guardian\u2019s Emma Graham-Harrison and Quique Kierszenbaum report: The TikTok videos feature Israeli soldiers, standing under the concrete blast barriers of a military base, in front of a rolling green landscape or beside armoured vehicles. Most are in full military gear, in settings that make clear these are men at war, with one message to their country\u2019s journalists: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have something unifying to say, just shut your mouth.\u201d To someone who made a cursory scan of the country\u2019s TV channels and newspapers after 7 October, the reservists\u2019 anger might be confusing \u2013 the Israeli media have rarely presented their audiences with such a uniformly patriotic vision of reality as they have over the past three months. A \u201cunited we will win\u201d slogan sits on the screen for most TV news and talk shows. Politicians face heavy criticism, but interrogations of the military, its strategies, its generals and ordinary troops are muted. The suffering of Gazan civilians barely features, veteran journalists say, three months into an Israeli offensive that has killed more than 22,000 people, displaced nearly 2 million, and left nearly half the population on the brink of famine and stalked by disease. \u201cIn general, the Israeli media is drafted to the main goal of winning the war, or what looks like trying to win the war. If you want to try to find some similarities, it\u2019s along the lines of the American media after 9/11,\u201d said Raviv Drucker, one of Israel\u2019s leading investigative journalists.

In a new post on Saturday, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who is on a weeklong tour in the region, said that he met with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, to discuss the war in Gaza. Blinken is scheduled to host talks with leaders from Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Almost 90% of Gaza\u2019s 2.4 million people have been \u201cforcibly displaced and lack everything\u201d, UNRWA said. Amid Israel\u2019s deadly bombardment of Gaza, which has reduced most of the strip to rubble while killing more than 22,700 Palestinians, survivors are grappling with severe shortages in food, water, medical supplies and fuel. According to UNRWA, 1.9 million Palestinians have been displaced across Gaza, with 1.88 million Palestinians sheltering in and in the vicinity of 155 UNRWA installations. Meanwhile, 131 UNRWA installations have been damaged as a result of Israel\u2019s deadly strikes across Gaza. Hundreds of people in London have blocked off Westminster Bridge in calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, where Israeli strikes have killed more than 22,700 Palestinians since 7 October. The Guardian\u2019s Mabel Banfield-Nwachi writes: Hundreds of protesters in London have staged a sit-in on Westminster Bridge, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza in the first big demonstration of the year. Protesters blocked off the bridge and the surrounding roads after a march from St James\u2019s Park in central London on Saturday. The demonstration, organised by the Free Palestine Coalition, renewed calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. It also called for the UK to stop arms sales to Israel and an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestine. The group announced a meeting location \u2013 a drinking fountain in St James\u2019s Park \u2013 at 10am on Saturday and protesters began to gather around midday. The Metropolitan police made several arrests at the park, before protesters marched through Westminster and were then stopped by officers in Parliament Square, next to Big Ben. For the full story, click here: European foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned on Saturday that it is \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d that Lebanon not be dragged into a regional conflict as a result of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Speaking at a press conference with Lebanon\u2019s foreign minister, Borrell said: \u201cIt is imperative to avoid regional escalation in the Middle East. It is absolutely necessary to avoid Lebanon being dragged into a regional conflict,\u201d Agence France-Presse reports. \u201cI am sending this message to Israel, too: nobody will win from a regional conflict,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI think that the war can be prevented, has to be avoided and diplomacy can prevail.\u201d Since 7 October, Lebanon\u2019s Iran-backed Hezbollah has exchanged frequent cross-border fire with Israeli forces. On Tuesday, a strike in a Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut killed Hamas\u2019s deputy leader, Saleh al-Arouri. Israel has not claimed responsibility while a US official told AFP that Israel was behind the strike. Earlier on Saturday, Hezbollah said that it launched a barrage of rockets at northern Israel as a \u201cpreliminary response\u201d to al-Arouri\u2019s killing. If you\u2019re just joining us, here\u2019s a quick rundown of all the latest from the crisis in the Middle East. Northern Israel was hit by a barrage of rockets fired from southern Lebanon on early Saturday. Hezbollah later said it had launched the attack as a \u201cpreliminary response\u201d to the killing of Hamas\u2019s deputy chief in a Beirut suburb last week. Israel later carried out a series of retaliatory strikes on Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon. The Israeli military said its fighter jets had attacked targets in the towns of Aita al-Sha\u2019ab, Yaron, and Ramya, hitting a launch site and military buildings. The EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said during a visit to Lebanon that a Palestinian state was the \u201conly way\u201d to achieve peace in the region. He also warned against an escalation of the conflict in Gaza, saying that \u201cnobody will win\u201d if other countries in the region are dragged in. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has begun a week-long tour of talks with regional leaders. Visits to Turkey and Greece on Saturday will be followed by stops in Israel and the West Bank as well as Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. The leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, called on Blinken to use the tour to end what he called Israel\u2019s \u201caggression\u201d. He said US support for Israel\u2019s operation in Gaza had \u201ccaused unprecedented massacres and war crimes against our people\u201d and that he hoped Blinken had \u201clearned the lessons of the last three months\u201d. Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run Ministry of Health said at least 122 Palestinians have been killed and 256 injured over the past 24 hours. The latest figures brought the overall toll since the start of Israel\u2019s operation in Gaza to 22,722 killed and 58,166 injured. Hundreds have attended a pro-Palestinian protest outside the Houses of Parliament in London. Pictures from the event showed rows of police standing in front of crowds, with many protesters waving Palestinian flags. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the Red Sea could impact the British economy. Asked by the BBC whether the attacks could push inflation back towards the high levels seen in recent years, he said: \u201cWe obviously have to monitor what\u2019s happening in the Red Sea. It may have an impact and we\u2019ll watch it very, very carefully.\u201d Coalition forces are assisting a merchant vessel in the Red Sea after six small craft were seen approaching it, according to UK Marine Trade Operations. A statement from the body, which reports security information on behalf of the Royal Navy, said the craft had come within one nautical mile (1.15 miles) of the vessel as it sailed around 50 nautical miles off the coast of Yemen. It added that no weapons had been sighted but that authorities were investigating. Since the beginning of the conflict in Gaza, Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have been targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea, which is a major route for global maritime trade. Assassination is a two-edged sword. Last week\u2019s targeted killing in Beirut of Hamas\u2019s deputy leader is but the latest of many covert attacks on individuals in Iran and the Arab sphere attributed to agents of Israel. Do prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials in Jerusalem ever consider the possibility they may be paid back in kind? Hamas may not have the expertise and reach, although a booby-trap bomb requires no particular skill. But Iran does and maybe Hezbollah, too. Israel\u2019s assassination in December of a top Iranian general in Syria, plus last week\u2019s atrocity in southern Iran \u2013 claimed by Islamic State terrorists but officially blamed on Israel \u2013 could goad Tehran\u2019s more rabid hardliners into seeking an eye for an eye. Like Netanyahu, Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, is not averse to disposing of foes with chilling finality. The trail of bodies since he became president in 2000 is a long one, stretching from the gates of the Kremlin to Salisbury and back again to Siberia. Putin tried to kill Ukraine\u2019s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, when he invaded in 2022. He may yet try again. Read Simon Tisdall\u2019s full piece on how brute force threatens to triumph in 2024 here: More now from the visit to Lebanon by Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, which comes amid wider diplomatic efforts to stop the conflict in Gaza spreading to elsewhere in the Middle East. Speaking at a news conference held with the Lebanese prime minister, Najib Mikati, Borrell said he wanted to start a European-Arab initiative to revive a peace process, with the ultimate aim being a two-state solution. \u201cThe only way is the creation of a Palestinian state,\u201d he said, adding that the prospect of a state would offer a \u201chorizon of hope\u201d to the Palestinians. He said he would also visit Saudi Arabia on Sunday to discuss steps to secure peace across the region. Hundreds of people have gathered outside the Houses of Parliament in London calling for an end to the conflict in Gaza. Pictures from the event showed rows of police standing in front of crowds, with many protesters waving Palestinian flags. People could also be seen holding placards reading \u201cStop arming Israel\u201d and \u201cCeasefire now\u201d. Footage on social media showed dozens of other people lying down in front of Westminster Bridge as part of an apparent die-in demonstration, in which participants simulate being dead. Dissent inside the Biden administration over the president\u2019s Gaza policy is growing, with a public resignation this week of a Department of Education official, and a letter signed by more than a dozen Biden campaign staffers calling for a ceasefire and the conditioning of aid to Israel. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty extraordinary levels of dissent,\u201d said Josh Paul, a career official working on arms sales at the state department who resigned in protest in October, of the mounting signs of discontent. \u201cI am hearing in recent weeks from people who are thinking more seriously about resigning.\u201d Tariq Habash, the Department of Education official, also said he had heard from many more officials than he had anticipated who were contemplating their own exits. \u201cI hope it resonates with the president and the people who are making policy decisions on this issue that is affecting millions of lives,\u201d he said. Read Jonathan Guyer\u2019s full story here: Lebanon\u2019s Sunni Islamist Jama\u2019a Islamiya faction said in a statement on Saturday it had fired two volleys of rockets at Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel. The attack comes after Lebanon\u2019s Iran-backed Hezbollah group said earlier it had fired at least 62 rockets towards Israel on Saturday morning, Reuters reports. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, sounded the alarm on Saturday about Lebanon being dragged into a regional conflict in a spillover from Israel\u2019s war with Hamas. Borrell, speaking during a visit to Lebanon, said it was imperative to avoid a regional escalation in the Middle East, and warned Israel that \u201cnobody will win from a regional conflict\u201d, Reuters reports. He was commenting at a new conference with the Lebanese prime minister, Najib Mikati, following talks with top government officials to discuss events in and around Gaza, including the impact of the war and the situation at the Israeli-Lebanese border. \u201cWe are seeing a worrying intensification of exchange of fire across the Blue Line,\u201d Borrell said. The demarcation between the two countries was mapped by the UN to mark the line to which Israeli forces withdrew when they left south Lebanon in 2000. Here are some of the latest images from the news wires: The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, says he will visit Saudi Arabia on Sunday to discuss steps towards peace in the region, Reuters reports. The leader of Hamas has called on the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to use his week-long Middle East tour to end what he called Israel\u2019s \u201caggression\u201d. In a video message, Ismail Haniyeh, who is based in Qatar, said US support for Israel\u2019s operation in Gaza had \u201ccaused unprecedented massacres and war crimes against our people\u201d and that he hoped Blinken had \u201clearned the lessons of the last three months\u201d. \u201cWe ... hope that he will be more focused this time on ending the aggression [and] the occupation of all Palestinian lands,\u201d Haniyeh said. Haniyeh also called on the leaders due to meet with Blinken throughout the week to tell him that stability in the Middle East was \u201cclosely linked to our Palestinian cause\u201d. Blinken is visiting Turkey and Greece today and is also set to hold talks in Israel and the West Bank as well as Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has met with the Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, at the start of a week-long trip for talks on the situation in the Middle East. In a statement, Fidan said the pair had discussed the conflict and humanitarian crisis in Gaza as well as Swedish accession to Nato. Turkey initially blocked Sweden\u2019s bid for Nato membership, accusing it off harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which it considers a terrorist group, but last year agreed to back the country\u2019s accession. In the 91 days since Gal Dalal fled the Nova festival, winter rains have seen grass and flowers flourish in the fields nearby, but his life has stayed stuck on a dusty October morning. When Hamas closed in on 7 October, Dalal managed to escape across the fields but was separated from his younger brother. Guy \u2013 22 years old, talented, goofy and, above all, his best friend \u2013 was kidnapped and taken to Gaza. All Gal can think about is getting him home. \u201cIt looks different, you can see much more green around here. It makes me think how much time has passed, but for me, it\u2019s like time has stopped,\u201d he said on his first trip back to the Nova site, standing in eucalyptus groves that were a campsite last time he was here. \u201cI\u2019m reliving that day, thinking my brother has been held [in Gaza] so long. I love him and miss him so much.\u201d He travelled back with relatives of other hostages and one teenager who had been kidnapped at the festival, enduring nearly two months captive in Gaza. The group wanted to remember their loved ones in the last place they were happy, and call for their return at a press conference there. Read Emma Graham-Harrison\u2019s full piece here: Israel has carried out a series of strikes in southern Lebanon after around 40 rockets were fired into northern Israel early on Saturday. The Israel Defence Forces said its fighter jets had attacked a number of sites run by Hezbollah in the areas of Aita al-Sha\u2019ab, Yaron and Ramya. It said that among the targets were a launch site and military buildings. Aerial footage posted to X showed strikes being carried out on a number structures. At least 122 Palestinians have been killed and 256 injured over the past 24 hours, according to Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run Ministry of Health. The latest figures bring the overall toll since the start of Israel\u2019s operation in Gaza to 22,722 killed and 58,166 injured. The World Health Organization and the United Nations have made a new delivery of medical supplies to southern Gaza, the WHO director-general has said. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the shipment included eight refrigerators, eight solar panels, and clean delivery kits to supports 66 births as well as medicines and supplies to enable surgeries. He added that it would support 142,000 people requiring care. The supplies were sent to a drug storage facility operated by the Hamas-run Palestinian Ministry of Health in the city of Khan Younis and will be distributed to hospitals from there, Ghebreyesus said. He said 15 intensive care unit beds and 15 regular hospital beds were also sent to a UN-run field hospital in the area. Ghebreyesus said the supplies offered a \u201cglimmer of hope\u201d to people in the south but were \u201conly a small percentage of what is needed\u201d. He said the WHO had been unable to send supplies to northern Gaza since 26 December and that it was \u201cimperative\u201d it be allowed to do so. Analysis has shown that Israel\u2019s operation in Gaza has done extensive damage to hospitals and health facilities in Gaza and left many of them no longer functional. Pictures from a pro-Palestine rally in Indonesia on Saturday show protesters gathering to call for an end to the Israeli operation in Gaza. Hundreds of people attended the event, held in the city of Depok, with some seen carrying placards that read \u201cend the siege of Gaza\u201d and \u201cstop killing Palestine\u201d. The commander of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard has vowed to continue to target \u201cthe enemy\u201d amid tensions over attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. Speaking at a ceremony to unveil a new naval ship in the city of Bandar Abbas, Hossein Salami said: \u201cToday, we are facing an all-out battle with the enemy. \u201cWe need to defend our national interests to wherever they extend. \u201cIt will be harmful for the enemy to be found near. They should stay away from this area.\u201d Salami didn\u2019t specify who he meant by \u201cthe enemy\u201d, but more than 20 countries are now participating in a US-led operation to protect Red Sea shipping from attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Attacks by Houthi rebels on shipping in the Red Sea may impact the UK economy, the chancellor has said. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Today programme, Jeremy Hunt was asked whether the attacks could push inflation back towards the high levels seen in recent years. \u201cWe obviously have to monitor what\u2019s happening in the Red Sea,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may have an impact and we\u2019ll watch it very, very carefully.\u201d Since the outbreak of the conflict in Gaza, Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen have been targeting commercial ships moving through the Red Sea, forcing a number of major shipping companies to reroute their vessels. Hunt added that the government had been \u201cvery clear to the Houthis\u2026 that there will be consequences and we will not just sit back and accept [the attacks], because [the Red Sea is] so vital for global trade\u201d. In a joint statement issued on Wednesday, the UK, US, and 12 other countries described the attacks as \u201cillegal, unacceptable, and profoundly destabilizing\u201d. They added that the Houthis would \u201cbear the responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy, and free flow of commerce in the region\u2019s critical waterways\u201d. The dramatic first week of 2024 has tipped the scale towards those who say the daily diet of drone strikes, assassinations and maritime assaults will at some point combust into a major war across the Middle East. But the likelihood of a regional conflagration turns on the unclear intentions of Iran and the contested degree of control it exercises over the numerous linked but autonomous groups it has nurtured over the past decade in five sovereign countries. With so many variables, what looks like being a long war in Gaza increases the risk of miscalculation, accident or that one of the many players loses patience and lights the touch paper. It is already hard to continue to describe the level of violence around US bases in Iraq, on the Lebanese border or the Red Sea as low intensity. Iran, led by a combination of the ageing Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guards, is at the centre of all that happens in the Middle East. Read Patrick Wintour\u2019s full piece here: This morning\u2019s rocket attacks in northern Israel come a day after the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, warned that his group\u2019s response to the killing of Hamas\u2019s deputy chief last week would be \u201cdecided on the battlefield\u201d. Speaking on Friday, Nasrallah said: \u201cWe cannot keep silent about a violation of this seriousness, because this means that all of our people will be exposed [to targeting]. \u201cAll of our cities, villages and public figures will be exposed.\u201d He added that the repercussions of silence would be \u201cfar greater\u201d than the risks of retaliation. Saleh al-Arouri, a senior figure in Hamas, was killed on 2 January in an Israeli strike on a suburb of the Lebanese capital, Beirut. He was living in Lebanon at the time of his death. Hezbollah says it hit an Israeli observation post early on Saturday with 62 rockets as a \u201cpreliminary response\u201d to the killing of Hamas\u2019s deputy chief last week, Reuters reports. Senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri was killed on 2 January in an Israeli drone strike on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs of Dahiyeh. Hezbollah\u2019s chief, Hassan Nasrallah, has said the assassination changed the nature of the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, warning that a response was \u201cinevitable\u201d and heightening fears of a regional escalation in fighting. Washington\u2019s top diplomat will discuss the Gaza war with Turkey\u2019s mercurial leader on Saturday, Agence France-Presse reports. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, arrived in Istanbul late on Friday for the first leg of a trip that includes visits to Israel and the West Bank, along with five Arab states. Blinken\u2019s fourth crisis tour since the start of the Israel-Hamas war three months ago comes with fears mounting that the conflict will engulf swathes of the Middle East. Istanbul served as a base for Hamas political leaders until Hamas fighters raided Israel on 7 October, triggering the war. Turkey asked the Hamas chiefs to leave after some were captured on video celebrating the attack. But the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has since turned into one of the Muslim world\u2019s harshest critics of the scale of death and destruction in Gaza \u2013 and of Washington\u2019s support for Israel. Erdo\u011fan has compared the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to Adolf Hitler and accused the US of sponsoring the \u201cgenocide\u201d of Palestinians. He has also rebuffed US pressure to cut off the suspected flow of funding through Turkey to Hamas and defended the group as legitimately elected \u201cliberators\u201d fighting for their land. The US State Department on Friday announced $10m rewards for information about five alleged Hamas foreign operatives \u2013 three of them believed to be based in Turkey \u2013 thought to be helping finance the Iran-backed group. Turkey this week countered by detaining 34 people suspected of planning attacks against Palestinians and spying for Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence agency. Blinken will travel to the Greek island of Crete on Saturday evening for talks with the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, to address Greek concerns about the looming sale of US F-16 fighter jets to Turkey. About 40 rockets were fired from Lebanon at northern Israel on Saturday, the Israeli military said. Sirens sounded in the north and the rockets later crossed into the Meron area, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said. There were no reports of injuries. No rockets or drones were fired at other parts of northern Israel. The IDF said it attacked a \u201cterrorist squad\u201d in Lebanese territory that took part in the launches. Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the Middle East crisis. I\u2019m Adam Fulton and here\u2019s a rundown on the latest news as it turns 9am in Gaza City, Tel Aviv and Beirut. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is to discuss the war in Gaza with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, on Saturday amid mounting fears the conflict could widen to engulf other parts of the Middle East. Washington\u2019s top diplomat arrived in Istanbul late on Friday for the first leg of a week-long trip that includes visits to Israel and the occupied West Bank as well as five Arab countries. Erdo\u011fan has been one of the Muslim world\u2019s harshest critics of the scale of death and destruction in the Gaza Strip and of US support for Israel. Meanwhile, the European Union\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, travelled to Lebanon on Friday for talks about the situation in Gaza and on the Israeli-Lebanese border and the importance of avoiding a regional escalation. Israel continued to bomb Gaza on Saturday, with strikes reported in the southern city of Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of people have sought shelter. More on those stories shortly. In other key developments: Israeli officials are scrambling to head off mounting frustration in Washington in the run-up to a potentially difficult meeting between Blinken and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, by offering a series of policy proposals on Gaza that critics say lack detail or commitment. The US has staunchly supported Israel in its war against Hamas but is keen to secure concessions from Netanyahu to lower regional tensions and help avert a wider conflict. The UN humanitarian chief says has described Gaza as now \u201cuninhabitable\u201d after relentless bombing by Israeli forces. Martin Griffiths said a \u201cpublic health disaster is unfolding\u201d in the territory as people faced \u201cthe highest levels of food insecurity ever recorded\u201d, adding: \u201cFamine is around the corner.\u201d The head of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, said the assassination of senior Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut has changed the nature of the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. In a second nationally televised address within three days, Nasrallah warned that a response was \u201cinevitable\u201d, heightening fears of a dangerous escalation in the conflict. His comments came as Lebanon issued a formal complaint to the UN security council over al-Arouri\u2019s killing and over Israeli incursions into Lebanon\u2019s airspace to attack targets in Syria. Israel\u2019s defence minister has warned that time is running out on diplomatic efforts to end tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. Yoav Gallant said that Israel would soon be left with no choice but to launch a military offensive against Hezbollah. Israel carried out an airstrike on a Hezbollah command centre in the southern Lebanese village of Blida on Friday in response to attacks on the border, the Israel Defence Forces said. It said Israeli tanks and artillery also shelled a number of areas along the Israel-Lebanon border, reportedly to foil planned Hezbollah attacks. At least 22,600 Palestinians have been killed and 57,910 wounded in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Friday. About 162 Palestinians were killed and 296 wounded over the previous 24 hours, the ministry added. At least six people have been killed in an apparent Israeli airstrike on a home in the southern Gaza city of Rafah overnight to Friday. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it was \u201cappalled\u201d by what it called the continuous shelling of al-Amal hospital and the Palestine Red Crescent Society headquarters in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. The federation said the strikes had resulted in the loss of innocent civilian lives, including a five-day-old infant, and that one of its medics had been injured. The head of Unicef said time was running out for children in Gaza, who are \u201ccaught in a nightmare that worsens with every passing day\u201d. Children in the territory face a \u201cdeadly triple threat\u201d to their lives from the spread of diseases, plummeting nutrition and the escalation in fighting, Catherine Russell said. The governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda have denied a report they have been in talks with Israel over taking in thousands of Palestinians from Gaza. According to the report, the Israeli government has been conducting secret talks with multiple countries regarding a \u201cvoluntary\u201d migration scheme for Palestinians. The report came as two far-right Israeli ministers earlier this week called for the resettlement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. Jewish settlers have quietly carried out an \u201cunprecedented surge\u201d of unauthorised moves in the occupied West Bank while the world\u2019s attention has been focused on war in Gaza, an Israeli watchdog group has warned. The result has been \u201cnot only physical harm to Palestinians and their lands but also a significant political shift in the West Bank\u201d, the report said. Germany\u2019s foreign minister warned against an Israeli occupation of Gaza as she called for more humanitarian pauses in the war. Israel \u201cmust do more for the protection of the civilian population\u201d in its war against Hamas in Gaza, said Annalena Baerbock, who is expected to travel to Israel on Sunday for her fourth visit since the war broke out. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Humza Yousaf, has urged the UK government to demand an end to Israel\u2019s \u201cindiscriminate attacks\u201d that have killed thousands of children in Gaza. Yousaf said it was time the UK made clear to Israel that its actions in Gaza had gone \u201cway beyond a legitimate response\u201d to the 7 October Hamas attacks. The commander-in-chief of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said at the funeral on Friday for the victims of twin bombings claimed by Islamic State that their deaths would be avenged. More than 84 people were killed at a memorial in the city of Kerman on Wednesday for former top commander Qassem Suleimani, who was assassinated in Iraq in 2020 by a US drone. Iranian security forces had detained 11 people suspected of links to Wednesday\u2019s attack, Iran\u2019s intelligence ministry said. A Turkish court has decided to formally arrest 15 people and deport eight others suspected of being linked to Mossad, Israel\u2019s national intelligence agency. Turkey warned Israel last month of \u201cserious consequences\u201d if it tried to hunt down members of Hamas on Turkish soil."

The warning comes as Iran waits on high alert to see how Joe Biden responds to the death of three US servicemen deemed by Washington to have been killed by a Tehran-backed militia based in Syria. US bases in Syria and Iraq have suffered more than 160 attacks of varying seriousness since Hamas\u2019s 7 October assault on Israel. Amid fears of a US reprisal, the Iranian rial fell to its lowest point in 40 years against the dollar, even as Tehran reiterated that the strike was the work of independent \u201cresistance groups\u201d \u2013 Iran\u2019s standard response to US accusations that itproliferates military turmoil across the region by arming and training the groups. Hamas is designated a terrorist group by the US and the EU. The value of Iran\u2019s national currency has fallen by 15% since 7 October. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called for tighter controls on liquidity at a meeting with business leaders, reflecting his concern that inflation was crushing living standards, and creating a difficult atmosphere in advance of nationwide parliamentary elections in November. Inflation is running at 40%. Now, Iranian media is openly speculating on the nature of possible reprisals \u2013 largely basing their discussions on US media reports. Both sides have emphasised they are not seeking an open war, but Tehran considers that a US attack on its territory is a red line that will be met with an appropriate response. As tensions rose, the Iranian foreign ministry summoned the British ambassador, Simon Shercliff, on Tuesday to demand the UK ends its allegations that Iran is attempting to intimidate Iranian dissidents living in Britain. The Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, struck a confident note that events across the region were still trending in Iran\u2019s direction. He said the White House knew well that \u201ca political solution\u201d was required to end the carnage in the besieged Gaza Strip and the current crisis in the Middle East. He said: \u201cDiplomacy is moving forward on this path. Benjamin Netanyahu is nearing the end of his criminal political life.\u201d With a US attack on Iranian positions inside Syria seen as the most likely option, Iran\u2019s deputy interior minister, Seyyed Majid Mirahmadi, in a meeting with his Syrian counterparts discussed the crisis and insisted the so-called \u201caxis of resistance\u201d was on the verge of victory. Javad Zarif, the former Iranian foreign minister, said he believed Israel\u2019s \u201caura of invincibility\u201d had cracked. In an interview he claimed: \u201cThe foreign policy of the Israeli regime is based on two axes: oppression and invincibility.\u201d Zarif said Israel\u2019s war policy had three pillars: the war must be outside Israel, it must be surprising, and it must end quickly. He said that both Israel\u2019s two foreign policy axes and its three military policy pillars had been broken by the 7 October attack. But Iran itself faces its own challenges: unrest has broken out across Kurdistan after the execution on Monday of four Kurds accused by the regime of co-operating with Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agencies. Images circulating online show deserted streets and shuttered shops in Sanandaj, Saqqez, Mahabad, Bukan, Dehgolan and other cities. The four men, all members of the leftwing Komala party, were executed for allegedly plotting a bombing in Isfahan last summer in collaboration with Israel. Mehdi Saadati, a member of the parliament\u2019s national security and foreign policy committee, said: \u201cThese executions are a lesson for anyone who wants to stand against the will of the Iranian nation because the Iranian nation will punish them for their deeds.\u201d But it remains unclear if the latest repression is linked to a nervousness in Iran at the degree of support for the regime\u2019s interventionist foreign policy. Although support for Palestinians is widespread through Iranian society, the regime is worried that the state of the economy and general political disaffection could drive down turnout at parliamentary elections in March, undercutting its claim to legitimacy. In an attempt to boost participation in the vote, the number of ballot boxes has doubled, and candidates are being given additional time on TV and radio to try to generate an atmosphere of excitement. There is no \u201cpostal voting\u201d but numerous mobile stations are to be deployed. Turnout in the 2020 parliamentary elections was recorded as below 42.5%, with voting in the capital, Tehran, dropping to 26.2% \u2013 the lowest figures since the 1979 revolution. Something similar is expected this time round. But if turnout falls below 40%, it would be a blow to the regime\u2019s prestige, and confirm the revolution is surviving off a mixture of repression and alienation."

            "date": "2024-01-31T12:25:37Z",
            "content": "House Republicans voted along party lines after midnight on Wednesday to move toward impeaching the homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, for a \u201cwillful and systematic\u201d refusal to enforce immigration laws as border security becomes a top 2024 election issue. In a charge against a cabinet official unseen in nearly 150 years, the homeland security committee debated all day on Tuesday and well into the night before recommending two articles of impeachment against Mayorkas to the full House. The committee Republicans voted in favor, while the Democrats unified against, 18-15. The partisan showdown reflected the Republicans\u2019 efforts to make the Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump\u2019s hardline deportation approach to immigration their own. That approach was mirrored on a second front on Tuesday, as Republicans also lambasted the border deal recently brokered between the Joe Biden White House and a bipartisan group of senators, Democrats and Republicans alike. Mayorkas, in a letter sent to the Republican chair of the House committee on homeland security before the hearing began, dismissed the impeachment process against him as \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d. \u201cI have been privileged to serve our country for most of my professional life. I have adhered scrupulously and fervently to the oath of office I have taken six times in my public service career,\u201d Mayorkas wrote. \u201cI assure you that your false accusations do not rattle me and do not divert me from the law enforcement and broader public service mission to which I have devoted most of my career and to which I remain devoted.\u201d The Republican chair of the committee, Mark Green of Tennessee, criticized Mayorkas\u2019s letter as an inadequate response to concerns about the situation at the US-Mexican border, where arrests for illegal crossings have reached record highs. \u201cThis 11th-hour response demonstrates the lack of seriousness with which Secretary Mayorkas views his responsibilities,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe cannot allow this man to remain in office any longer. The time for accountability is now.\u201d Democrats retorted that Republicans were making a farce out of the impeachment process by rushing to oust a cabinet official without showing any wrongdoing. House Republicans have presented no clear evidence that Mayorkas committed high crimes and misdemeanors, which is the requirement for impeachment. Their resolution accuses the cabinet secretary of refusing to comply with the law and breaching public trust. \u201cWe\u2019re here based on two completely fabricated, unsupported and never-used-before articles of impeachment,\u201d said the Democratic congressman Dan Goldman. \u201cThis is completely debasing and demeaning the impeachment clause of the United States constitution, and it is a gross, gross injustice to the credibility of this institution.\u201d Now that the Republican-controlled committee has advanced the resolution, the House speaker, the Republican Mike Johnson of Louisiana, has indicated that the full chamber will vote on impeaching Mayorkas in the coming days. Even if the resolution passes the House, it will certainly fail in the Senate, where Democrats hold a majority. To demonstrate his scorn over the proceedings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, introduced several procedural motions to delay the progress of the hearing. Thompson accused Republicans of attempting to impeach Mayorkas to boost the political prospects of Trump. \u201cIf House Republicans were serious about improving conditions along the border, they would provide the department the funding necessary to do so. They have not,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want progress. They don\u2019t want solutions. They want a political issue. And most of all, they want to please their disgraced former president.\u201d Meanwhile, as the House moves forward with impeaching Mayorkas, Trump has called on Republicans to sink the border deal. Johnson has said that the proposal, a bipartisan arrangement that would grant Joe Biden the authority to shut down the border between ports of entry when attempted crossings increase to a certain level, would be \u201cdead on arrival\u201d in the House. Johnson is expected to address the House on Wednesday. At a press conference on Tuesday, he dismissed claims that Republicans were doing Trump\u2019s bidding as \u201cabsurd\u201d and insisted they were focused on addressing the situation at the border. \u201cOur duty is to do right by the American people, to protect the people. The first and most important job of the federal government is to protect its citizens. We\u2019re not doing that under President Biden,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOur majority is small. We only have it in one chamber, but we\u2019re trying to use every ounce of leverage that we have to make sure that this issue is addressed.\u201d The White House attacked Johnson for flip-flopping, noting that the speaker previously called on members of both parties to \u201ccome together and address the broken border\u201d. \u201cToday, Speaker Johnson claimed he believes action should be taken to secure the border,\u201d said the White House spokesperson Andrew Bates. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what President Biden and Republicans and Democrats in the Senate are doing. Speaker Johnson should join them.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-18T19:16:13Z",
            "content": "Reading\u2019s dire finances have led staff to rejig training plans to avoid paying for undersoil heating, as the crisis club look to curb costs. The League One side, owned by the Chinese businessman Dai Yongge, have implemented a number of drastic cost-cutting measures, including 19 redundancies, and owe about \u00a34m to suppliers. Staff and former employees talk of \u201cfirefighting\u201d on a daily basis as the club fights a series of off-field problems. The English Football League has called for Dai to fund or sell the club after displaying a \u201cclear disregard\u201d for his duties. Reading trained on the one practice pitch with undersoil heating on Thursday and an under-21s match was played on the surface on Monday but first-team staff have been encouraged to minimise usage. There have been instances in recent weeks when the manager, Rub\u00e9n Sell\u00e9s, has been asked to adjust training schedules or use the gym to save on the cost of undersoil heating, which is turned on before sessions and switched off immediately after. The first team can train on other pitches but freezing temperatures of late have led them to train later, once those have thawed. Reading said payments for the undersoil heating were taken automatically upon use and that it had been general practice for a while to activate it only when essential. They acknowledged that the club\u2019s financial troubles meant it was imperative they were savvy with how much they use it. Despite the cold conditions, on occasions staff at the club\u2019s impressive \u00a350m Bearwood training base, opened by Dai in 2019, have been wearing coats and jackets inside the main first-team building because the upstairs heating does not work. The club said a maintenanceproblem was unresolved but some staff believe the lack of heating is to keep costs down. The club has made 19 redundancies, including in the new year the assistant manager, Andrew Sparkes, and the head of player development, Eddie Niedzwiecki. Most roles have gone in the academy, which is at risk of losing its category one status, and more first-team staff jobs are understood to be in danger. The club insisted no further roles had been identified as at risk. A number of suppliers have lost patience. The data company StatsPerform, which provides Opta data, has frozen its account with the club and another, the catering firm Levy, has pulled out of the training ground but remains at the stadium. As a result, medical staff are sourcing meals for players. Dai acquired control of the club with his sister Dai Xiu Li in 2017, when they were a Championship playoff final victory from promotion to the Premier League, and is thought to have invested in excess of \u00a3250m in an attempt to reach the top flight. Now the club is taking desperate measures to \u201csave pennies\u201d, as one insider puts it. Post-match food provided at Reading Women\u2019s FA Cup tie at home to Wolves last Sunday, played at Aldershot, has led to illnesses among both sets of playersand forced Wolves to postpone a game against West Brom because a number of their squad were affected. In November, the EFL pushed for Dai to be disqualified as an owner after a financial breach but an independent panel felt such action would not solve Reading\u2019s problems. The commission instead fined him \u00a320,000 for failing to adhere to meet the EFL\u2019s financial demands of depositing 125% of the monthly wage bill into a holding account. A suspended \u00a350,000 fine was activated last Friday after he again failed to meet those demands. Dai is not thought to have paid either of the charges. Reading have been deducted 16 points since November 2021 for financial breaches, including the late payment of wages. The club has spent much of the past two years under transfer embargoes owing to their failure to pay HMRC on time. The under-fire chief executive, Dayong Pang, has sanctioned the sales of the defenders Tom Holmes and Nelson Abbey, both to Luton \u2013 though it remains to be seen whether the latter will join \u2013 and other players, such as Tyler Bindon and Charlie Savage, could follow. Savage is stuck on 14 league starts because if he makes another he will trigger a \u00a32,000-a-month pay rise. Before Christmas the club terminated the contract of Ovie Ejaria, who signed a lucrative four-year contract after arriving from Liverpool in 2020, saving the club about \u00a3200,000. There are understood to be three or four parties interested in purchasing Reading who have non-disclosure agreements but there are concerns within the club that prospective buyers could \u201crun a mile\u201d because of the bleak financial picture. Reading, who visit Wigan on Saturday, are 21st in League One and at risk of successive relegations. Overnight stays have largely been scrapped but Reading will have one on Friday. \u201cWe cannot move on as a club unless we get new owners,\u201d one staff member said. This weekend the Football Supporters\u2019 Association is encouraging clubs to show solidarity with Reading supporters by having a minute\u2019s applause in the 16th minute, the point at which Reading fans invaded the pitch against Port Vale last Saturday, prompting the game to be abandoned. Exeter City, direct rivals of Reading, are among those that have pledged to do so. Reading could face a suspended points deduction as a sanction for the invasion, as Blackpool did in 2015 in protest at their then owners. The EFL, which has in effect conceded Dai is unfit to run the club, are relatively powerless to overthrow him. On Wednesday the EFL board debated whether the league should have a golden share in all of its 72 clubs but its chairman, Rick Parry, acknowledged that would create \u201ca right hornets\u2019 nest\u201d. \u201cWe can\u2019t actually force the sale, we can\u2019t seize the shares, [because] it is company law,\u201d Parry said. \u201cShort of seizing the club, the [EFL\u2019s] powers, sadly, are limited.\u201d Reading released a statement on Wednesday saying \u201cMr Dai has agreed that he will sell the club at the earliest opportunity\u201d. The club\u2019s former chief executive Nigel Howe is leading the process and said Dai had enlisted the help of \u201clawyers to assist in the disposal\u201d of the club."

            "date": "2024-01-17T18:53:13Z",
            "content": "The Qatari bidder for Manchester United, Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani, dropped out of the race to buy the club after failing to prove he had sufficient finance for the deal, according to a document submitted to American authorities. In filings made to the US Securities and Exchange Commission to confirm Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s acquisition of 27.69% of the club, Jassim (referred to as \u201cBidder A\u201d) is described as having failed to respond to requests to show where his money was coming from. It was also revealed that Ratcliffe issued a Christmas Day deadline for acceptance of his final offer, threatening to walk away if there was no progress. As part of the Schedule 14D\u20119 filing, which articulates a business\u2019s response to a takeover offer, United said Bidder A failed repeatedly to submit the \u201ccustomary financing commitment letters\u201d. After a series of revised and improved bids over the spring of 2023 came without the letters attached, the board of directors at United eventually told Jassim that they would \u201crequire sufficient evidence of the financing and customary financing commitment papers\u201d before continuing with negotiations. Those papers never arrived and on 15 October Bidder A withdrew from the process. A relatively obscure figure within the higher echelons of Qatari society, Sheikh Jassim arriving as a suitor for a club valued by the Glazer family at more than $5bn raised eyebrows at the time, with questions asked as to whether he had sufficient money or whether he was the frontman for a bid funded by the Qatari state. Despite a stream of media reports articulating the transformative potential of Jassim\u2019s ownership, it appears that prospect was never close to reality. The long and complicated history of the United sale is laid bare in the filings, showing how Ratcliffe slowly expanded and increased his offer before pivoting to taking a minority stake in July 2023. Filings also show that in the week before Christmas, Ratcliffe\u2019s company, Trawlers Limited, \u201cgave Manchester United a deadline of December 25, 2023 to accept its best and final proposal\u201d. This came after pushback from directors outside the Glazer family to an \u201cOctober Proposal\u201d from Ratcliffe of $33 (\u00a326) for 25% of Class A and B shares plus $300m capital. Ratcliffe responded by agreeing to slight concessions after conversations between 18 and 22 December but \u201cwas not prepared to accept any of other changes proposed by the non-affiliated directors\u201d. On 22 December a board meeting featured a \u201crobust discussion regarding the feedback from [Ratcliffe]\u201d. The board representatives noted Ratcliffe \u201ccould decide to withdraw [the] proposal if the board of directors was not prepared to move forward by December 25, 2023\u201d. That transaction was subsequently agreed on 24 December, bringing an end to a process that started in November 2022."

            "date": "2024-01-30T09:00:24Z",
            "content": "The Bank of England has shelved a \u00a3250,000 plan to revamp its museum, adding at least a year to more than five years of debate about how to provide a focal point for financial education in England and Wales. As a recently launched parliamentary inquiry into the state of financial education in English schools progresses, the central bank\u2019s move shines a spotlight on the UK\u2019s lowly position in international league tables for the general understanding of financial matters. The UK is ranked 15th out of 29 countries for financial literacy by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), despite having the largest and most powerful financial services industry in Europe. The Bank\u2019s latest decision on the path of interest rates, due on Thursday, could send people in the UK scrambling to examine their mortgage rates if policymakers hint at an early move. Robin Walker, the Tory MP for Worcester and chair of the all-party education committee conducting the inquiry, says the UK needs to use its expertise \u201cto help children and adults better understand money and economics\u201d. \u201cWe should welcome more opportunities for them to understand the role of finance and financial services. Institutions like the Bank of England need to play a part in that education,\u201d he adds. In the time since officials at the Bank began considering a revamp of the only money museum in England and Wales, a string of museums have opened or been overhauled at a cost of more than \u00a3100m. The Museum of Making in Derby, based in the world\u2019s first fully mechanised factory has opened after an \u00a318m project. The Imperial War Museum in London has undergone a \u00a330.5m refit and the Museum of the Home in east London, has expanded at a cost of \u00a318m. The Bank\u2019s museum is housed on the ground floor of its grade-I listed building on Threadneedle Street and displays rare coins, cash registers and a collection that includes historically prominent women on banknotes. An exhibition on the City\u2019s links to slavery closes next month. The museum, which usually attracts more than 100,000 visitors a year, will soon host an exhibition on digital payments, asking: \u201cCan the tooth fairy go cashless? Are cryptoassets money?\u201d The Bank refused to explain the decision to delay a refurbishment that was expected to introduce interactive exhibits to supplement the displays of coins and memorabilia that take up most of the space. It is understood museum staff have faced constraints that apply to any building with a Grade I-listing \u2013 in this case the architect Sir John Soane\u2019s neo-classical fortress that stands opposite the Royal Exchange in the heart of London\u2019s financial district. Heritage regulations raise the costs of a revamp and limit what staff can do to refresh exhibits dating back to the Bank\u2019s foundation in 1694. It museum\u2019s only rival in the UK is Edinburgh\u2019s Museum on the Mound, which also examines \u201cthe story of money\u201d and has about 50,000 visitors a year. Like its London-based counterpart, it is not an independent institution, after being set up and run by Bank of Scotland, which is now part of Lloyds Banking Group. To give a comparison, the Science Museum group, which operates London\u2019s Science Museum, the Science and Industry Museum, National Railway Museum, Locomotion, and National Science and Media Museum, expects 5 million visitors in 2026. Walker\u2019s review is focused on the financial education of school-age children and how teachers can incorporate basic concepts into the maths curriculum. The Labour party has already pledged to teach more of the maths curriculum through the prism of household budgeting, currency exchange rates for going on holiday, sports league tables and cookery recipes. The thinktank Centre for Social Justice carried out research in 2022 that found two-thirds of young adults who experienced financial difficulties believed better financial education could have helped them. The government-funded Money and Pensions Service (MaPS) estimated in 2020 that 4.8 million children had received \u201ca meaningful financial education\u201d. It wants to increase the number to 6.8 million by 2030. MaPS research found that half of 18- to 24-year-olds report feeling anxious when thinking about their money, while about two-thirds (65%) of the same age group could not add interest earned to a savings balance or understand compound interest. Just over half (55%) of young people aged 16 and 17 are not able to read a payslip correctly. Sara Weller, the chair of the MaPS, said: \u201cExperts are clear, that children form a view of money before they are seven years old and currently we don\u2019t have a framework for teaching it until secondary school level, when children are already 11 years old.\u201d However, the plan to expand financial literacy in schools faces an uphill task. A study by the Bank in 2022 found almost two-thirds of teachers felt there was not time or resources to fit the subject into the school year. The most prominent exhibition in recent years to debate the importance of money was staged last year at the Fitzwilliam Museum, which is funded by the University of Cambridge. Under the title, Defaced! Money, Conflict, Protest, the show focused on money as a medium for protest and dissent and \u201chighlighted the small defacements on coins and notes, which revealed the opinions of people who otherwise went unheard\u201d. Much of the exhibition is on tour, but not in the UK \u2013 it can now be seen at the Art Gallery of Ontario, Canada. Dr Richard Kelleher, the exhibition\u2019s curator, says: \u201cThere was a noticeable demographic shift in the age of visitors to Defaced! compared with other shows, with the biggest proportion in the 45-54 range and a definite increase in the number of younger people coming to the museum.\u201d He added: \u201cPart of the appeal of exhibitions about money is their ability to connect with the visitor. For better of worse money is a constant part of our lives and we all have a relationship with cash. \u201cWe covet it, don\u2019t have enough of it, try to hide it, worry about it, try to grow it. For these reasons and others we have a means to connect. Money exhibitions can play a powerful role in developing visitors\u2019 financial literacy; particularly driving a better understanding of the banking system, debt, assets and liabilities, inflation and concepts of value, through creative presentations of the history of money. Sharon Heal, the director of the Museums Association, says an independent money museum to house permanent exhibitions could fall foul of a funding crisis that is forcing many museums to consider restricting opening hours or higher charges for special exhibitions. \u201cThere is money for capital spending but the cuts to revenue budgets are severe,\u201d she says. The largest and most advanced money museum in the world is the Interactive Museum of Economics in Mexico City. Funded by the central bank, government departments, big commercial banks and financial institutions, but with an independent charter, it is housed in a refurbished convent in the heart of the city. Among exhibits of old coins, the museum boasts a trading room with virtual reality headsets that can turn a classroom of children into day traders. There is also a \u201cFuture of Money\u201d room that allows visitors see how digital money is created and to experiment with different ways to pay electronically. There are no proposals to set up an independent economics or money museum in the UK and a revamp of either of the existing museums in London or Edinburgh seems a long way off."

            "content": "The US\u2019s first large-scale offshore wind project, located off the coast of Massachusetts, has started producing power for the first time, delivering a boost to Joe Biden\u2019s ambitions of a proliferation of coastal wind turbines to help combat the climate crisis. The first wind turbine in the Vineyard Wind development started to whirr on Tuesday, delivering around 5MW of power to the New England grid. The operator of the project said it expects to have five turbines operational in the early part of this year, before eventually having 62 turbines as part of the project, which will produce enough electricity to power 400,000 homes. \u201cThis is a historic moment for the American offshore wind industry,\u201d said Maura Healey, the governor of Massachusetts. \u201cThis is clean, affordable energy made possible by the many advocates, public servants, union workers and business leaders who worked for decades to accomplish this achievement.\u201d The US has been slow to develop offshore wind compared with some other countries, but Biden has enthusiastically backed the concept, with the White House setting a goal to deploy 30GW of offshore wind by 2030, enough to power 10m homes with clean energy, and several projects are now planned. Vineyard Wind, about 15 miles (24km) off the coast of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, is the largest so far and its launch is \u201ctruly is a milestone for offshore wind and the entire renewable industry in North America\u201d, according to Tim Evans, a partner at Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, which is developing the project with Avangrid, which is itself owned by a Spanish electricity utility. The breakthrough, which has occurred more than a year after developers started assembling and installing the 850ft-tall turbines in the ocean, comes just a month after a separate, smaller, project begun off the coast of New York. The 12-turbine project, called South Fork Wind, is operated by the Danish wind energy developer \u00d8rsted and the utility Eversource. The arrival of Vineyard Wind is a welcome tonic to a nascent offshore wind industry that has struggled in the US in recent months, despite support from the Biden administration and amenable east-coast state governors. On Wednesday, the energy giants Equinor and BP terminated their agreement to sell power to New York state from their 1,260MW Empire Wind 2 offshore windfarm, citing rising inflation, higher borrowing costs and supply chain issues. Equinor blamed \u201cchanged economic circumstances on an industry-wide scale\u201d. Last year, \u00d8rsted also canceled two large offshore wind projects in New Jersey due to concerns over high costs, supply chain problems and the failure to secure hoped-for tax credits. The fledgling industry has also been assailed by opponents, including Donald Trump, fishers and some environmentalists, for supposedly endangering marine life and for spoiling coastline views. Scientists have said there is little evidence that creatures such as whales are adversely affected by wind turbines. Some of this opposition has been backed by fossil fuel-funded interests concerned that offshore wind poses a threat to the incumbency of oil, coal and gas use that is driving dangerous global heating."

            "content": "For nearly 40 years, Frank Morton has been breeding plants. Particularly drawn to lettuce, he began breeding specialty salad greens, once a rarity in the produce market. Using an organic farm system, 68-year-old Morton developed entirely novel lettuce varieties and eventually started the Philomath, Oregon-based Wild Garden Seed company with his wife, Karen. Though he loves the work, being a small-scale plant breeder doesn\u2019t come without challenges. Over the years, Morton has watched large corporations take over the seed industry, using utility patents to claim seeds as an invention. A utility patent protects an invention from being used, replicated or sold without permission. This has left smaller-scale breeders in limbo, often unsure of what they can and can\u2019t use when developing new plant varieties. Morton has experienced first-hand the effects of such patents. In 2021, he shared one of his lettuce varieties, the \u201cFunny Cut Mix\u201d, with a trusted customer who also breeds plants. The lettuce was a true mix: some heads red, some green, others spotted. The leaves were all different kinds of frilly. The customer planned to include \u201cFunny Cut Mix\u201d in their lettuce trials, which plant breeders use to evaluate how well a variety will perform in a specific environment. A few months later, the customer informed Morton that his \u201cFunny Cut Mix\u201d would be excluded from further trials because it looked like a patented lettuce type called Salanova, owned by the Dutch company Rijk Zwaan. Though he didn\u2019t use any patented material to develop \u201cFunny Cut Mix\u201d, Morton\u2019s variety was excluded simply because its appearance might infringe on that patent. Morton doesn\u2019t blame his customer. Instead, he points to the restrictive system of utility patents and the fear it instills in small-scale seed breeders. \u201cHere I am, trying to compete and I can\u2019t compete because they don\u2019t want to compare my lettuce to a patented lettuce\u201d out of precaution. In 1980, the US supreme court ruled in the case Diamond v Chakrabarty that patent protection can be used for living organisms, including plants. Seeds, which have been openly saved and shared by growers for thousands of years, could now be claimed as an invention. When a company is granted a utility patent on a type of seed, it doesn\u2019t just own the seed. It also owns its traits (color, texture, disease resistance, the way it was grown), future generations of that seed and all of the rights to research. So, if a plant breeder like Morton develops his own variety of lettuce and the lettuce matches any of the traits of a patented variety \u2013 whether it be color, the curliness of the leaf or a trait that makes it conducive to a particular climate \u2013 the breeder is technically in violation of patent law and risks getting sued by the patent owner. There are utility patents for \u201cBrilliant White Cauliflower\u201d, \u201cPleasant Tasting Melons\u201d, \u201cRed Lettuce\u201d and \u201cHeat Tolerant Broccoli\u201d. Some patents are so extensive in what they cover that they are nearly 50 pages long. \u201cThey are essentially just doing obsessive-compulsive descriptions of plants and laying claims to those traits, so if anyone else has those traits, they are in violation,\u201d Morton said. The US patent system was designed to encourage competition and promote innovation. However, the patent system has opened the door for large corporations to patent thousands of plant varieties and traits, locking up genetic resources seed savers have relied on for generations. Today, just four companies \u2013 Bayer, DowDupont/Corteva, ChemChina-Syngenta and BASF \u2013 control over 60% of the seed market worldwide. Bayer alone owns over 20 different varieties of lettuce, some of which the company has owned for over a decade. Each patent has an extensive list of the variety\u2019s traits and characteristics. The system rewards powerful firms with the resources to develop and enforce patents, explained Phil Howard, a professor in the department of community sustainability at Michigan State University. As patent law is complicated and ambiguous, many small-scale breeders don\u2019t know if the seeds they want to work with are patented or not. He said this stifles their freedom to experiment. \u201cSome of these big firms will intimidate seed breeders into believing that there are broad patent claims on many seeds, when in fact there aren\u2019t. So the current lack of transparency and the complexity really gives massive advantages to these big firms and really hinders the smaller firms.\u201d Adaptive Seeds is an organic seed company that grows without chemical fertilizer and does not use any form of intellectual property rights; anyone can openly save and share their seed varieties. In April 2020, the company received a letter from BASF, a German multinational chemical company and the owner of Nunhems, the fourth-largest vegetable breeding company in the world. The letter did not directly accuse Adaptive Seeds of using patented material, but did list varieties of seeds and traits Nunhems had patented. It was an ominous reminder of just how many traits and varieties BASF has control over. Andrew Still started Adaptive Seeds in 2009 after noticing the increasing consolidation in the seed industry. When breeding, Still typically uses seeds that have been marked as open-sourced and not patented. But patents can be confusing, so there\u2019s anxiety about accidentally using a large corporation\u2019s patented material, Still says. \u201cThere\u2019s always a general concern that one day they\u2019re going to decide we\u2019re selling something that they think is theirs and they\u2019re going to sue us over that,\u201d Still said. \u201cWe would just roll over because we don\u2019t have any lawyers or money for stuff like that and they do.\u201d For Kristyn Leach, a breeder at Second Generation Seeds, a seed hub that sells Asian heirloom seeds, seed is much more than a commodity. It represents a history of \u201cwhat someone values and how they farmed\u201d, a relationship that is unique to every region and farmer. She explained that to her smaller company, utility patents are not so much a day-to-day concern. Instead, they jeopardize culturally significant seeds in the long term. \u201cA lot of crops have been patented by companies that have no accountability to the places or people where these crops are native to,\u201d Leach said. The more seed is patented and controlled by fewer people, the more that seed is going to lose its genetic richness, she added. At Second Generation Seeds, Leach and her colleagues are trying to do the opposite \u2013 increase genetic diversity by recognizing seeds\u2019 connection to place and culture. The company acts as a marketing hub where small-scale farmers can sell packs of seed and receive the majority of the packet sale money in return, minus the cost of production. It\u2019s a way for smaller-scale breeders to enter the commercial seed market, which has become difficult with how the industry has consolidated, Leach says. With that consolidation has come the closure of public plant breeding programs. Over the last 30 years, nearly a third of the country\u2019s public plant breeding programs have been shut down. Leach sometimes collaborates with public university breeding programs that remain and that is when she has to be most diligent about not using patented material. In June 2023, the US Department of Agriculture and the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) launched the Farmer Seed Liaison, an online tool to help growers and seed companies better navigate the seed patent system. The resource includes a search engine for existing plant patents, guidance on how to read patent applications, as well as a portal where complaints can be submitted. \u201cIn our changing climate, farmers need access to a diversity of seed options more than ever. Unfortunately, today farmers don\u2019t always have robust choices \u2013 a challenge that was recognized in the Biden-Harris executive order on competition,\u201d Jenny L Moffitt, under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs, said in an email statement. \u201cUSDA\u2019s Farmer Seed Liaison initiative seeks to expand choices for farmers and strengthen the resiliency of our seed and food supplies by promoting access to seeds for research and plant breeding, working to ensure that growers have transparency about seed purchases, and bringing the voices of farmers, plant breeders, and small businesses into the seed patent review and policy process.\u201d Still, of Adaptive Seeds, thinks the program is a step in the right direction, but as a small-scale breeder he is leery of federally funded programs and the bureaucracy attached to them. He believes the real problem is anything that inhibits seed breeders from openly sharing with one another, as the whole patent system does. To do their part in ensuring at least a portion of seed remains a public resource, both Adaptive Seeds and Wild Garden Seed participate in the Open Source Seed Initiative (OSSI). Through OSSI, breeders pledge their plant varieties will not be patented or licensed in any way that can restrict use. Through the pledge, OSSI is developing a pool of seed that is available to all farmers, scientists and researchers for unrestricted use. There are currently over 500 plant varieties under the OSSI pledge. Morton, who is a founding member of OSSI, has pledged over 100 varieties, ensuring that what he grows can be used by others without restriction. He remains adamantly against \u201cpeople laying claims on the work of nature\u201d and will continue to do what he can to keep small-scale breeding alive. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about the principle of the whole thing. And whether or not breeders in the future will have the freedom to operate.\u201d"

The fire service said it had evacuated neighbouring properties as the building was in danger of collapsing. Firefighters were called to the blaze on Fox Street shortly before 2.20pm on Saturday and arrived to find a four-storey building \u201cwell alight\u201d. By 5pm, it was no longer classed as a major incident and the main body of the fire had been extinguished. By 6.30pm, nearby residents who had been evacuated were allowed back inside their homes. \u201cSuccessful firefighting tactics have resulted in the fire being greatly reduced,\u201d Merseyside fire and rescue service said. Earlier, shoppers watched plumes spread across the city centre and the smoke could be seen rising above Goodison Park during Everton\u2019s FA Cup tie against Luton Town. Lara Buchanan, a trainee teacher from Liverpool, was driving through Kingsway tunnel from the Wirral when she noticed a \u201cdark rolling cloud\u201d of smoke. She said she could \u201cfeel the heat\u201d of the blaze from her car and was shocked when she saw the extent of the fire. Buchanan, 23, told the PA news agency: \u201cI could see the fire before entering the tunnel but didn\u2019t know where it was coming from. As I came out of the tunnel into Liverpool, the sky was dark and all I could see was a black rolling cloud. \u201cThe building was blazing alight and I could feel the heat from the car driving past. I was shocked to see the cloud and scared for whoever may be affected.\u201d The fire service urged people to avoid the area and nearby residents and businesses to close windows and doors. It declared a major incident and divided the fire into four sectors. A statement on its website read: \u201cFire crews have been called to a large fire on Fox Street, Liverpool city centre, L3. \u201cTwelve fire engines and two aerial appliances are in attendance. Crews were alerted at 2.18pm and on scene at 2.23pm. Crews arrived to find a four-storey building 100 metres by 50 metres well alight. \u201cThe incident has been divided into sectors, with firefighters wearing breathing apparatus fighting the fire with main branch hoses. The building is showing signs of collapse and fire crews are evacuating buildings. \u201cThe incident is ongoing. Please avoid the area. Residents and businesses nearby should close windows and doors. If you have an existing health condition, keep medicines nearby and if any ill effects occur dial NHS 111 for advice.\u201d"

            "title": "Challengers abound but Djokovic and Swiatek loom large at Australian Open | Tumaini Carayol",
            "date": "2024-01-12T13:56:50Z",
            "content": "In the promotional campaign released by the ATP this month to welcome in the new season, the governing body of men\u2019s tennis underlined that it is determined to look towards the future. As numerous talented young players featured in the campaign, the poet James Massiah narrated the dawn of a new era in a sport that has moved on. Yet the tour\u2019s ranking belies its narrative. There may be newer, fresher challengers, but the figure at the head of the sport and the man to beat remains the same as it has been for well over a decade. After one of the most dominant seasons of his career, which yielded titles at the Australian Open, French Open, US Open and ATP Finals, and saw him finally clinch the Open era grand slam record, Novak Djokovic now sits at the No 1 ranking by over 2,000 points. He returns to his favourite grand slam chasing his 25th major title as the heavy favourite once more. Despite his dominance, there are still plenty of potential pitfalls. The first week of the season was a reminder that, at 36 years old, his body is increasingly likely to be an obstacle. At the United Cup last week, Djokovic struggled with a wrist complaint and he was defeated by Alex de Minaur. Injuries have never stopped Djokovic from winning in Australia. Meanwhile, Djokovic\u2019s closest competitors are in a far better position than a year ago. The players ranked between two and four are each responsible for Djokovic\u2019s four losses away from clay last season; although Carlos Alcaraz ended last season fatigued, his preternatural development continued as he clinched a second grand slam title under the most spectacular circumstances against Djokovic at Wimbledon. Alcaraz will have to quickly find his feet in Australia after opting against a warm-up tournament, but his rapid growth will surely continue. After a sophomore slump in 2022 following his rise to No 1, last year Daniil Medvedev returned to his best, performing at a consistently high level on hard courts and positioning himself for further grand slam success. Jannik Sinner, meanwhile, ended last season by living up to the intense hype as he spectacularly defeated Djokovic from triple match point down in the Davis Cup before carrying Italy to the title. Other players, particularly Holger Rune and Alexander Zverev, may be able to play spoiler, but it is Alcaraz, Medvedev and Sinner who should stare down Djokovic with the belief that they can stop him. While the protagonist of the men\u2019s game has remained unchanged for so long, the WTA has a different complexion at the beginning of the season. The disorder and inconsistency that characterised large parts of the late 2010s and early 2020s is long gone. The emergence of Iga Swiatek has transformed the game. The Pole set the tone with her singular 2022 season and, impressively, a number of players responded to the challenge she set by stepping up last year. The transformation of Aryna Sabalenka was a dramatic development, and the Belarusian went toe to toe with Swiatek for the No 1 ranking until the last week of the year at the WTA Finals. Behind them, Elena Rybakina backed up her 2022 Wimbledon title while Coco Gauff lived up to the suffocating hype and pressure by winning the US Open as she tore through the second half of the season. If the first week of the new season is anything to go by, none of the top four have lost any momentum. Rybakina and Sabalenka faced off in the Brisbane final, with the Kazakhstani delivering a statement 6-0, 6-3 win, while Gauff won in Auckland. In the United Cup, meanwhile, Swiatek showed her brilliance by going unbeaten in her five singles matches. It was wildly entertaining to see her even making her male opponents\u2019 lives difficult, battering their second serves and going toe-to-toe with them from the baseline in the mixed doubles matches. Swiatek begins as the favourite, even though she has been handed a tough draw. The No 1 seed begins against the 2020 champion, Sofia Kenin, with the winner facing either the 2016 champion, Angelique Kerber, or 2022 finalist Danielle Collins. She may well have to face Jelena Ostapenko or Rybakina, two players with great records against her, en route. Beyond the order at the top of the game, though, the definitive theme of the women\u2019s draw is the comebacks: Naomi Osaka and Kerber return from maternity leave, Emma Raducanu from injury, and Elina Svitolina and Caroline Wozniacki continue their stories from last year. Among them all, Osaka returning towards the top of the sport would be priceless. This year, there is a change for the competitors as the tournament moves to a Sunday start. While the organisers have said that the move is an attempt to minimise late finishes, an additional weekend day of play is an extra day of revenue for the tournament. Despite that, the Australian Open continues to offer notably less prize money than the other grand slam tournaments."

            "date": "2024-01-15T12:35:21Z",
            "content": "Some 966 days later, it resumed as if time had simply been paused. OK, he was clad in the No 10 shirt this time rather than the No 7 but in most other senses, it was as if Jadon Sancho had never been away. Whether that is positive or negative is not an easy question to answer. The immediate fillip that the on-loan Manchester United winger has given his old team is not in question. This is, however, the most typical of January transfers. Three desperate parties coming together to hammer out the best, least-worst solution to their very immediate problems. The opening stanza of the renewed player-club relationship underlined exactly why they\u2019ve come together and why, at this point in time, they need each other like they do. It would take a hard heart not to be pleased for Sancho. Entering the field as substitute at the same time as his friend Marco Reus in Saturday\u2019s trip to Darmstadt, it took him just over 20 minutes to make his statistical weight felt. With BVB a goal to the good but labouring, he drifted out to the right, darted on to Donyell Malen\u2019s cunning ball inside the full-back and put the perfect cross in front of Reus for the veteran to walk in the second. That Sancho was able to provide such instant satisfaction, decisive and unfussy, was a relief. Edin Terzi\u0107, who was a big ally of Sancho in his first spell in charge (in which they won a DfB Pokal together, with the England winger and Erling Haaland taking Leipzig to pieces in the Berlin final in 2021), knows him well and spoke at length before the match about how he expected it would take \u201ctwo to three weeks\u201d to get the new (old) man up to speed. Still, unimpressed by his team\u2019s performance here, he sent Sancho on 10 minutes into the second half. It reflected how BVB\u2019s feelings about a potential return have evolved in recent weeks. In autumn, they had politely declined inquiries when asked whether they might be willing to welcome him back to relaunch his career. That, however, was before BVB crawled to one win in seven Bundesliga games to finish 2023 six points adrift of the Champions League, out of the title race and leaving Terzi\u0107\u2019s future in question. In a season largely defined by Harry Kane\u2019s superhuman ability to paper over some of his team\u2019s unsightly faultlines, Dortmund were now hoping for a bit of the same, as quickly as possible. Indifference to an idea had become impatience to see its realisation in recent days. While United and BVB spent days picking over the last details of the temporary detail \u2013 salary splits and bonuses, an exercise in face-saving optics on the English giants\u2019 side as much as it was in financial gains \u2013 the latter party betrayed a little frustration. They had hoped to get this done for Sancho to join them at their traditional Marbella training camp, and there was certainly disappointment among the coaching staff when it became clear that the player wouldn\u2019t be cleared in time to do so. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d called a smiling Terzi\u0107 to Sancho from a first-floor window at the club\u2019s Brackel training centre on Thursday as the player arrived for training, in a wry nod. \u201cYou don\u2019t like training camps?\u201d There was a serious point behind the bonhomie. Marbella was where Terzi\u0107 turned a tanking season almost into a title-winning one this time last year, using the time away to connect with his senior players and motivate them to help him raise standards. If Marbella was again going to be a turning point this year, then there were no instant results. This was a stodgy, work-in-progress Dortmund, in which individual quality made the difference at moments in a game which, from the visitors\u2019 perspective, didn\u2019t have enough of it between the two teams. With only Julian Brandt\u2019s fine strike separating the teams Gregor Kobel was again called upon to bail them out, making a fine point-blank save to prevent a Luca Pfeiffer equaliser. Then Sancho, Reus and fellow substitute Youssoufa Moukoko sealed the deal. Terzi\u0107 now has plenty of help. Maybe more than he might have requested, with two new assistants in club legends Nuri Sahin and Sven Bender having recently arrived. Sahin\u2019s brief is to make BVB more refined in possession, but it looks like taking time. In the meantime Sancho is the ultimate quick fix. And a happy Sancho, it appears, is already a productive one. Talking points \u2022 Bayern got the Bundesliga under way in 2024 on Friday with tributes to the late Franz Beckenbauer, as they played their first match since his passing. The 3-0 win over Hoffenheim that followed was even more comprehensive than it looked on paper, give or take a short second-half flurry from the visitors that called a previously, and subsequently, frozen Manuel Neuer into action. At the other end Kane\u2019s 22nd of the season, following on from Jamal Musiala\u2019s brace (Beckenbauer\u2019s song Gute Freunde was played after the goals instead of the Can Can), equalled Robert Lewandowski\u2019s record total for the first half of a Bundesliga season (the England captain actually has a game to beat it, the delayed fixture against Union Berlin, which is played next week). \u2022 In more medium-term news, reports on Monday suggest that Bayern have finally found a deal with the coveted Max Eberl (and his previous club Leipzig) to join, though he will start work after the current transfer window, in which the club still have plenty of work to do. \u2022 Bayer Leverkusen made sure that they lead the Bundesliga at the halfway stage but they left it late, with Exequiel Palacios rifling in a late, late winner at Augsburg, inevitably from an Alejandro Grimaldo assist. It was the perfect boost at the end of a week in which they lost Victor Boniface, who pulled out of Nigeria\u2019s Afcon campaign, with a thigh injury until April (it has been suggested the club might now accelerate their interest in Red Star\u2019s teenage prodigy Jovan Mijatovic). The manner of the victory, if anything, made it more galvanising for Die Werkself. \u201cThe goal wasn\u2019t luck,\u201d insisted Xabi Alonso. \u201cIt was reward.\u201d \u2022 An extra bonus for Alonso and company \u2013 and for Dortmund in their efforts to make up ground to the top four \u2013 was that the remaining two in the top four, Stuttgart and Leipzig, both lost. The former (without goal machine Serhou Guirassy, away with Guinea) were blown over 3-1 at Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach after conceding to Robin Hack inside 20 seconds, while Marco Rose\u2019s team were conquered by Ansgar Knauff\u2019s early, brilliant goal in Leipzig for Eintracht Frankfurt. \u2022 It remains tight above Darmstadt at the bottom, with K\u00f6ln and their new coach Timo Schultz failing to build on a Davie Selke-bequeathed lead and only drawing with Heidenheim, Mainz needing a Silvan Widmer netbuster to take a point from Wolfsburg and Niklas Stark\u2019s late deflected goal getting Werder Bremen a point at Bochum in an ugly game that produced 11 yellow cards (and it felt as if the overworked Tobias Stieler had been lenient)."

            "content": "The pace of US economic growth slowed in the last three months of 2023, but far less than had been expected, underlining the continued resilience of the economy. The commerce department reported on Thursday that US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of economic health \u2013 grew at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the final quarter of the year, down from 4.9% in the previous quarter but in line with pre-pandemic growth, and well ahead of the 2% economists had expected. Robust consumer spending and government outlays contributed to the growth. The Federal Reserve has been attempting to cool economic activity in order to bring down inflation. Since March 2022 the Fed has increased rates to a 22-year high and held them there. Inflation has fallen from a high of 9% in June 2022 to 3.4%. The rate rises have increased the cost of borrowing and many \u2013 including the Fed \u2013 had expected a subsequent slowdown in economic activity to lead to layoffs. But so far the Fed appears to be on course for what it has termed a \u201csoft landing\u201d. Hiring has remained robust \u2013 unemployment hovers at close to a 50-year low \u2013 and while growth has slowed, consumers have continued to spend, the US economy has weathered the rate rises and stock markets have hit record highs. \u201cThe Fed \u2013 so far \u2013 has managed to strangle inflation without strangling the economy,\u201d said Dan North, senior economist with Allianz Trade Americas. North said the Fed rate rises were still working their way through the economy and he expected 2024 to be a year of slow growth \u201cbut we are not using the recession word yet\u201d. Polling since the end of the pandemic shutdowns has consistently shown that consumers are pessimistic about the state of the economy. There are signs that the gloom may be lifting. Last week the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched monthly consumer sentiment index rose 9.1 points to 78.8, its biggest monthly advance since 2005. \u201cConsumer views were supported by confidence that inflation has turned a corner and strengthening income expectations,\u201d said Joanne Hsu, the University of Michigan\u2019s director of surveys."

            "date": "2024-01-16T12:52:07Z",
            "content": "Pay growth in the UK slowed more than expected in November, in a sign that inflationary pressures have weakened more than the Bank of England was expecting when it issued its latest forecasts. Average pay growth was 6.5% in November, down from 7.2% in the previous month, according to the Office for National Statistics, as the UK jobs market weakened in response to high interest rates and stagnation across much of the economy. Economists polled by Reuters had expected total average earnings of 6.8% in November. Job vacancies tumbled at the fastest rate on record in December, the ONS said, in a further sign the UK labour market was now cooling. The ONS said despite the drop in wages growth, recent falls in inflation meant real wages grew for the fifth month in a row, easing the pressure on household disposable incomes. It added that overall, the jobs market remained stable with employment down only marginally and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.2%. The pound fell after the weaker than expected wage data prompted traders to raise bets that the Bank of England would start cutting interest rates in the spring. Sterling was down by 0.6% against the dollar at $1.2642. The central bank is expected to re-examine its outlook for the economy when officials meet next month. Most analysts expect the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee to hint at several interest rate cuts this year after acknowledging the weakening labour market and recent falls in inflation as indications of further stagnation. James Smith, the developed markets economist at ING, said it was probably a little early to expect a major change of direction by the Bank, \u201cbut recent data could lay the groundwork for a May cut as long as it continues to comply\u201d. He added: \u201cThe bottom line is that both wage growth and services inflation, the datasets that are guiding monetary policy right now, are below Bank of England projections.\u201d Financial markets expect five interest rate cuts this year by the Bank, taking interest down from 5.25% to below 4%. One of the Bank\u2019s key barometers, regular private sector pay growth, dropped further from a revised 7.2% in October (7.3% previously) to 6.5% in November, leaving it comfortably below the Bank\u2019s prediction for it to still be at 7.2% in December. Falling energy and fuel prices and the slowing economy have brought the headline rate of inflation down from 4.6% in October to 3.9% in November and are expected to exert further downward pressure in December when figures are released tomorrow. Samual Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said there was likely to be some concern inside the Bank that the steady picture for employment showed much of the jobs market remained tight, limiting further falls in wages and vacancies. The number of vacancies soared during the Covid pandemic as many older workers took early retirement, the number of workers signed off sick increased and younger workers opted to go back into education, but the ONS said vacancies fell for the 18th consecutive month in the three months to December, by 49,000 to 934,000. Analysts have also become increasingly concerned about recent global shocks from conflict in the Middle East that could harm trade and push shop prices back up again. The ONS figures on Tuesday showed that workers in the private and public sectors received almost the same level of pay rise, including bonuses, up by 6.4% and 6.6%, respectively, in the three months to November. In the private sector, restaurants, hotels and retailers offered the biggest pay rises of 7.2% on average, followed by City and finance workers, who received 7% on average. Construction workers were at the bottom of the pay league table with rises averaging 4.5%, reflecting the severe downturn across the building industry. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cIt has been tough for many families recently, but with inflation now falling and the economy gradually returning to growth today\u2019s continuing rise in real wages will offer further relief. \u201cOn top of this the cut in national insurance contributions will get more people back into the jobs market, not just supporting economic growth but saving a typical two-earner household about \u00a31,000 this year.\u201d"

Grant Fitzner, the ONS chief economist, said the bounceback was fuelled by the country\u2019s dominant services sector, with retail, car leasing and video games companies all having a buoyant month. \u201cThe longer-term picture remains one of an economy that has shown little growth over the last year,\u201d he said. Figures this week showed that some of Britain\u2019s largest retailers recorded a bumper Christmas shopping season, helped by growth in online orders and high demand for festive food and drink, despite subdued demand for costlier items such as furniture and electrical goods. The ONS said services output grew by 0.3% in November, reversing a fall in October after strikes in the health service and education had hit activity. Production output \u2013 which includes manufacturing and energy generation \u2013 also returned to growth, while activity in the construction sector slumped by 0.2%. Over the broader three month-period to the end of November, GDP was estimated to have fallen by 0.2%, reflecting the pressure on households amid the cost of living crisis. Yael Selfin, the chief economist at the accountancy firm KPMG UK, said the overall outlook remained \u201cgloomy\u201d, while a technical recession remained a possibility for the second half of 2023. \u201cEven if the economy manages to avoid a recession, it is expected to remain in stagnation territory,\u201d she said. The latest figures come amid growing expectations the Bank of England will cut interest rates this year as inflation continues to fall back from the highest level in four decades. Official figures due next week are expected to show inflation cooled in November from 3.9% in October, although households remain under significant pressure as prices remain high. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said it was welcome news that growth returned in November but cautioned that it would remain slow while inflation continued to fall back. \u201cWe have seen that advanced economies with lower taxes have grown more rapidly, so our tax cuts for businesses and workers put the UK in a strong position for growth into the future,\u201d he said."

            "title": "UK economic growth to rebound in late 2024, leading forecaster says",
            "date": "2024-01-22T00:01:42Z",
            "content": "The UK economy will benefit from falling inflation and lower interest rates in the second half of the year, boosting growth and allowing the government to offer pre-election giveaways, according to a study by a leading forecaster. Handing Rishi Sunak a new year boost, the advisory business EY Item Club, which is sponsored by the accountancy firm EY, said its winter forecast showed that a long period of economic stagnation \u201cshould begin to fade this year as falling inflation, potential interest rate cuts and tax reductions create momentum for growth in 2024 and 2025\u201d. Sunak and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, hinted last week that a budget statement in March was likely to include tax cuts, building on the reduction in national insurance that was promised in last November\u2019s autumn statement and which took effect on 6 January. Further tax cuts could feature in the 2024 autumn statement before a general election expected before the end of the year, if the recovery proceeds as predicted. The report shrugged off the likelihood of a recession in the second half of last year and the possibility of a further three months of negative growth in the first quarter of 2024, saying the underlying signs of a recovery would soon take effect. An increase in gross domestic product of 0.7% in 2024 made in the firm\u2019s autumn forecast was upgraded to 0.9%, while the UK economy is now forecast to grow by 1.8% in 2025, up from the 1.7% predicted in October. Last year\u2019s growth was downgraded from 0.6% to 0.3%, emphasising a loss of momentum in the second half of the year owing to persistently high inflation and sharply higher interest rates. Yet a recession is still possible if the economy is shown to have in the fourth quarter of 2023 after contracting by 0.3% in the third quarter. Several economists said last week that a surprise 3.2% drop in retail sales in December revealed a level of weakness in consumer spending that could drag the economy backwards in the fourth quarter. Financial markets expect the situation to improve once inflation \u2013 which averaged above 6% in 2023 \u2013 falls as expected to 2% by April, and for the Bank of England to begin cutting interest rates in June. A report by Lloyds Bank found that seven out of 14 sectors of the economy reported growing demand, as measured by new orders, in December 2023, more than twice as many as in November 2023. A bounceback in the moribund property market, high levels of demand for flights and holidays and rising disposable incomes after a long period of decline were all credited with giving business a lift in confidence. \u201cBusiness optimism reached the highest level since May as 12 out of 14 sectors reported higher confidence levels about their output prospects for 2024 compared to the same time the year before,\u201d the report said. Simon French, chief economist at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said that despite fears of a recession last year and weak Christmas shopping figures, the UK\u2019s economic outlook had \u201cimproved markedly\u201d over the last 12 months. The EY Item Club said interest rates should fall from 5.25% to 4% by the end of the year. Martin Beck, the club\u2019s chief economic adviser, said: \u201cAlthough it remains possible that the UK may have slipped into a technical recession in the fourth quarter of 2023, the mood music around the economy is justifiably improving. \u201cHigh inflation and expensive borrowing costs have been two of the biggest obstacles to growth recently and, with both showing encouraging signs of subsiding, prospects for late 2024 and beyond appear brighter.\u201d However, he warned there were risks that his forecast could be undermined by global events. \u201cOngoing geopolitical tensions could push up energy prices, which may slow the decline of inflation and increase costs for households and businesses. \u201cPlus, while the Bank of England is expected to reduce interest rates this year, the timing and extent of these cuts remain uncertain and continued high rates could prolong financial strain. The first half of 2024 should tell us a lot about the UK\u2019s prospects of returning to growth over the medium to long term.\u201d"

            "content": "The sport and entertainment platform Dazn has announced it is lifting its paywall on all of its women\u2019s football content and has launched a \u201cNew Deal\u201d campaign asking stakeholders in the women\u2019s game to think big in terms of their commitment to its growth. As a result of the lifting of the paywall, all remaining Women\u2019s Champions League matches this season \u2013 as well as 48 games in Spain\u2019s Liga F, 48 in the Frauen Bundesliga, 19 games France\u2019s D1 Arkema, 50 games in Italy\u2019s Serie A Femminile and 15 games in the Women\u2019s Saudi Premier League \u2013 will be guaranteed free to air in the UK and they will remain free to air for the foreseeable future. Hannah Brown, the co-chief executive of women\u2019s sport at Dazn, said the company\u2019s \u201clong-term strategy is about the growth of free\u2011to\u2011air coverage\u201d. Brown said: \u201cThe decision marries with the broader commitment to the launch of free. So, we announced this year what we\u2019re going to be doing around \u2018freemium\u2019 content, and women\u2019s football sits as part of that strategy. For us as a business it\u2019s the growth of a really important asset and about building a first-party relationship with customers on a global basis.\u201d In 2021 Dazn bought the exclusive global broadcast rights to the Women\u2019s Champions League and entered a partnership with YouTube. After two years the organisation planned to shift some games behind a paywall, but this decision was scrapped in November. Now, Dazn is opening up access to its coverage of other leagues, too. \u201cWhat we see in women\u2019s football is if you put a paywall up, there is a small proportion of people that are prepared to pay for it,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBut women\u2019s football fans don\u2019t exhibit those strong pay\u2011TV characteristics that we\u2019ve seen around premium football in domestic markets, where you see customers make a real pay choice in order to interact with something. Women\u2019s football fans are just not there yet.\u201d As well as the decision to open up access, Dazn is calling for women\u2019s football stakeholders to invest boldly for the long term to help collectively build the audience. Named after the 1967 women\u2019s football tournament in Deal, Kent, which broke a ban on women\u2019s football imposed by the Football Association since 1921 and was a catalyst for change, Dazn\u2019s \u201cNew Deal\u201d is asking clubs, sponsors, media and broadcast organisations to collaborate and drive the growth of the game. \u201cIn terms of assets and capability, this is a once in a generational investment opportunity,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other sport asset class that is as exciting as women\u2019s football. And the struggles the game has been through to get to where it is at today means that the bedrock of support it has is going to be very hard for anybody to pull back from.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-09T05:00:58Z",
            "content": "Frozen daiquiri anyone? Drinking a cocktail on top of a Dubai skyscraper may seem decadent enough, but a Greenland entrepreneur wants to add ancient glacier ice scooped from the fjords to the glass, for the ultimate international thrill. Arctic Ice harvests ice from the fjords of Greenland, and then ships them to the United Arab Emirates to sell to exclusive bars. Using glacial ice in drinks is a common practice in Greenland, and, over the years, several entrepreneurs have unsuccessfully attempted to export it. Its co-founder Malik V Rasmussen said the ice, which has been compressed over millennia, is completely without bubbles and melts more slowly than regular ice. It is also purer than the frozen mineral water usually used in Dubai\u2019s ice cubes. According to the company\u2019s website: \u201cArctic Ice is sourced directly from the natural glaciers in the Arctic which have been in a frozen state for more than 100,000 years. These parts of the ice sheets have not been in contact with any soils or contaminated by pollutants produced by human activities. This makes Arctic Ice the cleanest H20 on Earth.\u201d The startup was launched in 2022, but only dispatched its first 20 metric tonnes of ice recently. It has been hit with a wave of criticism which has taken the founders by surprise. Social media commentators have been unflattering, making comments such as: \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be worrying about the effects of global warming rather than selling glacier water?\u201d or \u201cWhat is this dystopia?\u201d. Other reactions and private messages have gone even further, including some comments which, according to Rasmussen, have \u201cverged on death threats\u201d. The company argues, however, that its ice is environmentally friendly and of social value. The fjords around Greenland are usually full of icebergs that have broken off glaciers which are connected to the Greenland ice sheet. Arctic Ice have a specialised boat with a crane attached, and they take it into the Nuup Kangerlua, the fjord around Greenland\u2019s capital, Nuuk, to look for a specific type of ice which has been in contact with neither the bottom nor top of the glacier. This ice is purer and difficult to spot in the water as it\u2019s completely transparent, and known locally as \u201cblack ice\u201d for this reason. Once they have found a suitable piece, they pick it up with the crane and place it in a blue plastic crate until the boat is full, then sail the ice back to Nuuk where they fill up a refrigerated shipping container with the crates. This container is transported to Denmark by the Icelandic shipping company Eimskip. In Denmark, according to Arctic Ice, it is loaded on to another ship that takes it to Dubai. In Dubai, the ice is sold by the local distributor Natural Ice, which already sells other types of ice in Dubai. The first stage of the shipping, from Greenland to Denmark, is, Arctic Ice argues, of low carbon-intensity, as most refrigerated shipping containers that leave Greenland would have been empty, because the country imports more frozen goods than it exports. It has now committed to becoming fully carbon-neutral, and once the supply chain has been established and Arctic Ice\u2019s carbon footprint calculated, all excess emissions will be calculated and compensated for, either through carbon capture and storage, or through emerging technologies that suck CO2 out of the air. \u201cHelping Greenland in its green transition is actually what I believe I was brought into this world to do,\u201d Rasmussen said. \u201cWe do have that agenda running through the company, but we may not have communicated it well enough yet.\u201d Rasmussen\u2019s primary aim, however, is to forge new revenue streams for Greenland, which is heavily financially dependent on Denmark, whose annual grant accounts for 55% of Greenland\u2019s budget. To gain more independence, politically and economically, economic growth is vital. \u201cIn Greenland, we make all our money from fish and from tourism,\u201d said Rasmussen. \u201cFor a long time, I have wanted to find something else that we can profit from.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 15 January 2024 to amend a web link to Natural Ice."

            "date": "2024-01-28T17:47:35Z",
            "content": "The United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has appealed to the 10 donor countries that have withdrawn funding from the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees to reconsider, saying the agency and Palestinians in desperate need should not be penalised due to the alleged acts of a dozen staff. Guterres said nine UNRWA staff had already been dismissed for alleged involvement in Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel on 7 October and any UN employee involved in acts of terror would be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution. He said the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), the highest investigative body in the UN system, had been asked to mount an inquiry. Israel\u2019s foreign ministry has vowed that UNRWA will play no role in Gaza when the conflict ends. UNRWA has 13,000 staff in Gaza and educates 30,000 children. Israel formally handed information to the UNRWA commissioner general, Philippe Lazzarini, last Sunday alleging that as many 12 UNRWA staff had been involved in the 7 October attack. Lazzarini immediately flew to New York to discuss the allegations with Guterres before informing key donors in the middle of the week and making an announcement on Friday, just as the international court of justice was delivering its verdict on South Africa\u2019s request for a provisional order directing Israel to allow aid into Gaza. UN officials had hoped to prevent a donor collapse by being seen to be acting pre-emptively and swiftly. But the US responded to the revelations by suspending its UNRWA funding, and since then nine other countries have followed suit, including the UK and Germany. The US was the agency\u2019s largest bilateral donor in 2022, contributing more than $340m. France on Sunday became the latest country to register its disapproval, saying it would review whether to provide further funds when they are due in the summer. UNRWA is an unusual agency in that it does not have large assets and runs a hand-to-mouth operation, even though it covers five countries and employs 40,000 staff, including 13,000 in Gaza. Lazzarini said: \u201cOur humanitarian operation, on which 2 million people depend as a lifeline in Gaza, is collapsing. I am shocked such decisions are taken based on alleged behaviour of a few individuals and as the war continues, needs are deepening and famine looms. Palestinians in Gaza did not need this additional collective punishment. This stains all of us.\u201d Guterres said the loss of funding meant the UN could not guarantee aid into Gaza for the whole of this month. \u201cTwo million civilians in Gaza depend on critical assistance from UNRWA for their daily survival, but current UNRWA funding will not allow it to meet all needs in February,\u201d he said. The aid crisis has been compounded by families of Israeli hostages for the past five days blocking the key aid crossing at Kerem Shalom until the hostages are released. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said on Saturday that the ICJ ruling required him to open the crossing. He added: \u201cWithout minimal aid to Gaza, we cannot complete the task and finish the war.\u201d UN officials pointed out that on 17 January UNRWA announced it was launching an independent review by external experts that \u201cwill help UNRWA strengthen its framework for the strict adherence of all staff to the humanitarian principles\u201d. The review was to examine a steady drumbeat of claims including UNRWA staff allegedly presiding over an antisemitic education curriculum. Ireland and Norway are two countries that have expressed horror at the allegations but rejected suspending funding, saying UNRWA acted swiftly as soon as the staff were identified. \u201cDonors, do not starve children for the sins of a few individual aid workers,\u201d said Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council. The EU has expressed its concern but not yet suspended aid. A UN-appointed expert on the right to food, Michael Fakhri, warned that the funding cuts meant famine was now inevitable in Gaza. Arab leaders have also expressed their alarm, and there will now be pressure on them to fill the funding hole. The countries that have suspended aid have not specified what more UNRWA should do to reclaim their confidence, except to demand further clarifications. Although aid can reach Gaza through other agencies such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, the key infrastructure for delivering aid in Gaza is through UNRWA. The near collapse in UNRWA funding came after the ICJ on Friday issued its order requiring Israel to \u201ctake immediate and effective measures immediately to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance\u201d. The effect of the allegations in the US media was to shift the spotlight rapidly away from the ICJ ruling on Israel\u2019s control of aid flows and on to the credibility of the main organisation delivering aid. But UNRWA is not alleging that Israel held back its evidence so that it emerged at the same time as the ICJ ruling. Israel has long wanted UNRWA dismantled, regarding it as too close to militant groups administering Gaza and more broadly as creating a culture of dependency by giving refugee status to the sons and daughters of refugees. The string of media allegations about UNRWA staff being complicit in terrorism led to Lazzarini setting up the 17 January review. According to Israeli sources, the allegations came from Israeli intelligence based on interviews with some of those captured during the 7 October operation. UNRWA supplies Israel with the names of its 13,000 staff, so cross-referencing names would have been possible. It is even alleged that UN vehicles were present at the scene of the massacre. It is inevitable that many of the 13,000 staff drawn from Gaza are hostile to Israel, and unofficial watchdogs such as UN Watch have repeatedly accused UNRWA of allowing its schools to teach anti-Israeli propaganda. UNRWA in the past three months has been a huge thorn in Israel\u2019s side by documenting the scale of the humanitarian crisis and the obstacles that Israel has placed in the way of aid distribution. Israeli ministers moved swiftly at the weekend to try to exploit the allegations about specific staff members to build the case for UNRWA\u2019s permanent dismantling. Israel sharply criticised Lazzarini. \u201cMr Lazzarini, please resign,\u201d the foreign minister, Israel Katz, wrote on X, adding that UNRWA would play no role in the \u201cday after\u201d the war in Gaza. The Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy accused UNRWA of being a \u201cHamas front\u201d. \u201cIt literally covers Hamas,\u201d he said on X. Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defence minister, tweeted: \u201cMajor changes need to take place so that international efforts, funds and humanitarian initiatives don\u2019t fuel Hamas terrorism and the murder of Israelis. Terrorism under the guise of humanitarian work is a disgrace to the UN and the principles it claims to represent.\u201d Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, said: \u201cHow symbolic that precisely on International Holocaust Remembrance Day it was proven what we have been claiming for years: that UNRWA employees are collaborators of the terrorist organisation Hamas.\u201d"

            "content": "Arts organisations have called on Suffolk county council (SCC) to reconsider a proposed 100% cut to its culture budget. As part of its plans to make \u00a364.7m in savings over two years, the council announced on Wednesday that it will stop core funding of \u00a3500,000 to art and museum sector organisations from April 2025. A shared statement from local organisations affected by the decision said the cut would make an \u201cextremely modest difference\u201d to the council\u2019s overall finances but have a \u201chuge impact\u201d on communities across the county. DanceEast, Eastern Angles theatre company, First Light festival, the New Wolsey theatre, Primadonna festival, Theatre Royal Bury St Edmunds and Suffolk Artlink said the cut in arts investment represented a saving of \u201cjust 0.057% of the council\u2019s 23-24 revenue budget\u201d. Their statement, released on Thursday, continued: \u201cThe \u2018cost\u2019 to our county will be so much more significant. Collectively, our organisations support 24,493 children and young people and 76,516 vulnerable people through our community engagement work. We also provide permanent employment for 154 staff, and project or contract employment for a further 499 staff. Suffolk-wide, the culture sector plays an important part in providing employment for local people, with almost 6,985 jobs being supported by the sector.\u201d The New Wolsey\u2019s chief executive and artistic director, Douglas Rintoul, said that it was already a difficult time for cultural organisations which are recovering from the impact of the pandemic and the cost-of-living crisis. Rintoul added: \u201cThese proposed cuts could jeopardise the artistic and creative vibrancy of the area and threaten economic growth. The cultural and creative industries generate over \u00a3272m for the region and contribute immeasurably to the visitor economy, community wellbeing, sense of identity and enjoyment of life at its every stage.\u201d Despite continued support from Arts Council England and Ipswich borough council, the proposed cuts \u201ccould force the theatre into making difficult decisions about the extent of its ongoing services\u201d to the local community. Both Ipswich\u2019s New Wolsey and the Eastern Angles theatre company have received council funding for four decades. \u201cI know local authority budgets are under extreme pressure from the drastic underfunding from the government, and council leaders across the UK are having to make tough decisions,\u201d said Jake Smith, artistic director and CEO of Eastern Angles. \u201cHowever, it is important to reframe investment in arts and culture as exactly that: an investment. It delivers not only an economic return but also contributes to the social health and wellbeing of our community.\u201d To assist with the transition, SCC said that \u00a3528,000 of Covid recovery money will be made available to arts organisations for the year 2024-25. \u201cWe are a well-run council and over the last five years, we have saved \u00a366m by working smarter and leaner. But we now need to go even further,\u201d said Richard Rout, SCC\u2019s deputy leader and one of 53 Conservatives on the 75-strong council. \u201cWe are putting adult and children\u2019s care at the heart of our plans,\u201d added Rout. \u201cWe have spent months scrutinising all the council\u2019s spending. There is competition for every pound across all our services, and I understand that each service means something to someone.\u201d \u201cSmaller theatres are the heart of our communities,\u201d tweeted Green councillor Robert Lindsay, expressing concern at the cut. Emma Buckmaster, Green party prospective parliamentary candidate for Bury St Edmunds and Stowmarket, said it was \u201ca shocking proposal \u2026 that will do lasting damage to the arts in Suffolk\u201d. Full details of the council\u2019s financial plans \u2013 which include a 4.99% increase in council tax \u2013 will be presented to its scrutiny committee on 11 January."

            "content": "Bernie Sanders, the progressive senator of Vermont, issued a statement Tuesday calling on Congress to block additional funding to Israel amid the war in Gaza, where more than 22,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks after Hamas killed 1,200 people in Israel on 7 October. \u201cWhile we recognize that Hamas\u2019 barbaric terrorist attack began this war, we must also recognize that Israel\u2019s military response has been grossly disproportionate, immoral and in violation of international law,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cEnough is enough. Congress must reject that funding. The taxpayers of the United States must no longer be complicit in destroying the lives of innocent men, women, and children in Gaza.\u201d Sanders has grown increasingly critical of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing government as the military strikes in Gaza have continued. Last month, Sanders introduced a resolution calling on the state department to investigate any potential human rights violations in Gaza, and he also condemned the US veto of a UN security council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Days later, the US abstained from a vote on another UN resolution calling for \u201curgent and extended humanitarian pauses\u201d in the war. Sanders\u2019 statement came as Congress considers Joe Biden\u2019s request for $10bn in aid to Israel as part of a larger funding package meant to assist US allies, including Ukraine, and address border security. Last month, Sanders notably opposed a $111bn funding proposal backed by Democrats because of his concerns about the money for Israel included in the bill. \u201cIsrael has the absolute right to defend itself against the Hamas terrorists who attacked them on October 7,\u201d Sanders said in a statement explaining his vote. \u201cThey do not have the legal or moral right to kill thousands of innocent Palestinian men, women, and children.\u201d Senate Republicans successfully blocked that funding bill from advancing, and bipartisan negotiations over a compromise measure have stretched on for weeks. It remained unclear on Tuesday whether an agreement could be reached. As the standoff has stretched on, the Biden administration has twice invoked its emergency authority to bypass Congress and approve two arms sales to Israel."

Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said Russian troops were holding ground on the outskirts of the east Ukrainian town of Avdiivka, an embattled industrial hub. Ukraine claimed to have carried out another drone attack on an oil facility deep inside Russian territory, according to a military intelligence source. Vladimir Putin called for an international investigation into the downing last week of an Il-76 military transport plane in the Belgorod region on Russia\u2019s border with Ukraine. The Russian president said that the plane had been struck with missiles fired from a US-supplied Patriot air defence system, which Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied. Olaf Scholz and four other European leaders admitted that the EU has \u201cfallen short\u201d of its goals to supply Ukraine with artillery ammunition on the eve of an emergency EU summit of EU leaders designed to break the deadlock between member states and Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n over a \u20ac50bn aid package. The EU must show \u201cclear commitment\u201d to Ukraine, which needs more ammunition, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said before a meeting with EU defence ministers in Brussels. The Kremlin said that it was monitoring the situation around Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine\u2019s top military commander, after western and Ukrainian media outlets said President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was trying to oust Zaluzhny. Russia\u2019s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, told military manufacturers to \u201cstop fooling around\u201d and further increase the production of self-propelled artillery systems during a visit to arms-producing factories in the Urals. Ukraine\u2019s air defences shot down 14 out of 20 drones launched by Russia in an overnight attack that injured one person and damaged commercial buildings, the military has said. I\u2019m closing the blog for the rest of the day, but we will be back tomorrow to bring you the latest updates. Thanks for following. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, will visit Nato member Turkey to meet President Tayyip Erdogan on 12 February, a Turkish official has said. Putin\u2019s visit will be his first to a Nato member since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Putin\u2019s scope to travel abroad has been limited since March last year when the international criminal court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant against him for the alleged deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia, a war crime. Russia denied the charge and called the move outrageous, but said it was legally void in any case because Russia is not a member of the ICC. Turkey is also not a party to the Rome statute of the ICC, so Putin can travel to Turkey without fear of being arrested under the warrant. Turkey has sought to maintain good relations with both Moscow and Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine. It has provided military support to Ukraine and voiced support for its territorial integrity, but also opposes sanctions on Russia in principle. Ankara is seeking to convince Russia to return to the so-called Black Sea Grain Initiative after Moscow withdrew last July, ending a year of protected exports from Ukrainian ports amid the war. Erdogan said alternatives to the deal could not provide a lasting solution. Ukraine carried out another drone attack on an oil facility deep inside Russian territory, a military intelligence source in Kyiv told AFP on Wednesday. Kyiv has ramped up strikes on Russian oil and gas facilities over the past two months, part of what it has called \u201cfair\u201d retaliation for Russian strikes on its own energy infrastructure. The claim comes after the governor of Saint Petersburg said there had been a loud blast at an industrial site outside the northern city. Local media meanwhile reported that S-400 missiles systems had shot at a drone that crashed on an oil storage facility in the Nevsky district. \u201cIt was a GUR operation,\u201d the source told AFP referring to Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence services. The source said the target was used for \u201cmilitary purposes\u201d. Ukraine, nearing the third year of war with Russia, posted a current account deficit of $9.8bn (\u00a37.7bn) in 2023 compared with a surplus of $8bn (\u00a36.3bn) in 2022, the central bank said on Wednesday. It said weak exports, rising imports and a smaller share of grants in international financial aid were key reasons for the deficit. The EU expects to reach 52% of its target to send 1m rounds of shells to Ukraine by March this year, according to the latest production data compiled by the commision, the bloc\u2019s foreign policy chief said on Wednesday. Speaking after an EU ministers\u2019 meeting in Brussels, Josep Borrell also said EU countries plan to train another 20,000 Ukrainian soldiers, on top of 40,000 already trained. Ukraine\u2019s ground forces commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, was offered the job of replacing his boss Valeriy Zaluzhnyi as commander of the armed forces, but declined, a source familiar with the matter has told Reuters. Ukrainian media reported that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy asked Gen Zaluzhnyi, head of the Ukrainian army, to step aside this week, but that he refused. His exit as army chief would represent a huge shake-up in the Ukrainian military, which is fending off multiple Russian attacks in the east as uncertainty grows over the future of vital US and European Union support. The source, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, was unable to say exactly how or when the job offer was communicated to Syrskyi. The Ukrainian general staff and president\u2019s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ukrainian media tipped Syrskyi and military spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as two possible successors to Zaluzhnyi. Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said Wednesday Russian troops were holding ground on the around the east Ukrainian town of Avdiivka, an embattled industrial hub. Agence France-Presse reports: Russia launched a costly bid in October to seize the town, that has been caught up in fighting since 2014 after it briefly fell to Moscow-backed separatists. Putin said in a televised event that Moscow\u2019s forces \u201cbroke through the enemy\u2019s defenses and reached the outskirts of Avdiivka.\u201d They captured 19 houses and are holding them. The mayor of Avdiivka told AFP last week that Russian forces entered the war-battered town for the first time, but were pushed back. Russian forces control territory to the north, east and south of Avdiivka, which had a pre-war population of around 32,000 people. Ukraine has said its forces were fending off attacks and holding out against Russia\u2019s efforts to surround the town. The capture of Avdiivka would provide a much needed victory for Russia to bring home as the second anniversary of its offensive and the March presidential election approaches. The international court of justice (ICJ) on Wednesday found Russia had violated some parts of a UN anti-terrorism treaty by not investigating financial support for separatist groups in eastern Ukraine in 2014, but did not order compensation as requested by Ukraine. The United Nations\u2019 top court declined to rule specifically on alleged Russian responsibility for the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, as Kyiv had asked it to do. The ICJ also ruled that Russia had violated the UN anti-discrimination treaty by failing to protect education in the Ukrainian language in Crimea. Enrolment in education in the Ukrainian language plummeted after Russia in 2014 declared that it had annexed Crimea from Ukraine, the UN\u2019s top court said. The court did not, however, grant Ukraine the compensation it had demanded from Russia, and rejected other claims of discrimination against ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians after the annexation. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will visit Nato member Turkey to meet with President Tayyip Erdogan on 12 February, a Turkish official said on Wednesday. Erdogan will travel to Egypt on 14 February, the official also said, after the two countries upgraded their diplomatic relations by appointing ambassadors last year following a decade of tension. Turkey and Ukraine have signed an accord that will allow Turkish construction firms to take part in the reconstruction of Ukrainian infrastructure damaged amid Russia\u2019s invasion, the two countries said on Wednesday. Reuters reports: Turkey shares a maritime border with both Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and has good ties with both. The Nato member opposes Russia\u2019s invasion, as well as Western sanctions against Moscow. In a meeting in Istanbul, Turkish Trade Minister Omer Bolat, Transport Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu, and Ukrainian Minister of Infrastructure Oleksandr Kubrakov signed a document setting out the parameters for a \u201cTurkish-Ukrainian Reconstruction Task Force\u201d. Bolat said the three ministers had discussed the role Turkey \u201cwill undertake in the reconstruction of Ukraine\u201d, and added the two countries would use the task force, which was formed under a 2022 memorandum of understanding on Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction, to determine projects in Ukraine and evaluate financing conditions. He said at the document signing ceremony: This will provide an important legal basis for efforts for the reconstruction of Ukraine. We are ready to cooperate with third countries as well. Kubrakov said the main areas in need of reconstruction were the housing and transport sectors, including roads, bridges and railways, and Ukraine\u2019s water transport infrastructure. He added that he believed the efforts would also boost bilateral trade. Vladimir Putin has called for an international investigation into the downing last week of an Il-76 military transport plane in the Belgorod region on Russia\u2019s border with Ukraine. The Russian president said that the plane had been struck with missiles fired from a US-supplied Patriot air defence system. Moscow accuses Kyiv of downing the Ilyushin Il-76 plane and of killing 74 people on board, including 65 captured Ukrainian soldiers it said were en route to be swapped for Russian prisoners of war. Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied that it downed the plane, and has demanded proof of who was on board. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has played down fears that a re-election of former US president Donald Trump would weaken the defence alliance as it works to ensure robust support for Ukraine. Stoltenberg said he did not think a second Trump presidency would jeopardise US membership in Nato. He told CNN: I believe that the United States will continue to be a staunch NATO ally, regardless of the outcome of the US election, because it is in the US interest. I worked with him for four years and I listened carefully, because the main criticism has been about the Nato allies spending too little on Nato. So the message from the United States that European allies had to step up has been understood and they are really moving in the right direction Republican Trump, a fierce critic of Nato when he was president, has repeatedly threatened to pull out of the alliance, complaining that the United States was paying more than its fair share. Stoltenberg, who has been pushing member states to boost defence spending, said more of the allies are increasing their military contributions. Trump has continued to criticise the alliance, saying over the weekend while campaigning that he did not believe Nato countries would support the United States if it were attacked. Nato\u2019s treaty contains a provision that guarantees mutual defence of member states if one is attacked. On the war in Ukraine, Trump has called for de-escalation and has complained about the billions spent so far. US Senate talks on a border security deal that some have set as a condition for additional Ukraine aid have encountered growing opposition among Republicans aligned with Trump. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, vowed Wednesday to rally European partners to cobble together support for Ukraine \u201cso huge\u201d that it would weigh on Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s calculations. Agence France-Presse reports: The pledge by the German leader, once criticised for dragging his feet on arming Kyiv, came with fears growing that support from Ukraine\u2019s biggest weapons supplier, the United States, could fall away. He told the German parliament ahead of an EU summit aimed at shoring up military support for Kyiv: We will do everything to ensure that the joint contribution from Europe is so huge that Ukraine can build on it and that Putin would not be able to count on our support waning at some point. In recent weeks, Scholz had ramped up calls for other EU nations to dig deeper for Ukraine. Germany has become Ukraine\u2019s second biggest armaments supplier after a sputtering start. Much of its contributions like Leopard tanks had been made only after public haranguing from other allies. Even now, Scholz comes under fire for refusing to provide the long-range Taurus missiles sought by Kyiv. Scholz added that it \u201cwould be hubris\u201d to imagine that Germany could shoulder the weight alone without the United States. \u201cWe are only a middle-sized power,\u201d he said. Russia and Ukraine have conducted a major prisoner-of-war exchange just one week after a previous swap was scuttled when a Russian Il-76 transport plane was shot down and exploded in a fiery crash along the border, writes the Guardian\u2019s Moscow correspondent, Andrew Roth. Russia and Ukraine both said that around 200 prisoners were exchanged on Wednesday, although the two sides disagreed about the exact figures. Ukraine said that it had returned 207 of its personnel in the swap, while Russia said that each side had handed over \u201cexactly\u201d 195 POWs. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wrote on Telegram: Our people are back. 207 of them. We return them home no matter what. He published photos showing Ukrainian soldiers hugging, making telephone calls, and crying after the swap. Many were holding yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flags. Zelenskiy continued: We remember each Ukrainian in captivity. Both warriors and civilians. We must bring all of them back. We are working on it. The Ukrainian team has done another excellent job. Russia\u2019s defence ministry released a statement in which it confirmed the swap and said that \u201cexactly 195 Ukrainian Armed Forces prisoners of war have been handed over\u201d for the return of 195 captured Russian soldiers. President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would continue such exchanges and that Kyiv had indicated it was open to more. Wednesday\u2019s swap showed an unexpectedly quick return to prisoner exchanges after Russia accused Ukraine of shooting down an Il-76 transport plane last week shortly before a similar swap was set to take place. Russia said that there were Ukrainian POWs on board the plane and accused Ukraine of intentionally targeting the flight. But Moscow has not released proof that there were prisoners aboard the plane or a confirmed flight manifest. Ukraine said it had no information about prisoners aboard the plane but confirmed plans for a swap and accused Russia of putting its servicemen at risk before the swap. Both sides have ordered an investigation into the crash. Russia has claimed that Ukraine\u2019s leaders are divided after Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, reportedly tried to pressure his popular armed forces chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, to stand down. Agence France-Presse reports: Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists in Moscow that reports of the attempted dismissal exposed \u201cgrowing differences\u201d between Ukraine\u2019s civilian and military leadership. Rumours have swirled across Ukrainian media this week that Zelenskiy was moving to fire Zaluzhnyi, who has headed the armed forces since before Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion. Various reports suggested Zaluzhnyi would be replaced by Kyrylo Budanov, chief of Ukraine\u2019s GUR military intelligence. Citing sources in Zelenskiy\u2019s office and entourage, Ukrainian news website Zn.ua reported on Tuesday that the president met commander-in-chief Zaluzhnyi on Monday to suggest he stand down and write a letter of resignation. Zaluzhnyi was offered another role \u2013 either as an adviser or ambassador, according to different reports. He rejected the proposal and the president did not dismiss him, Zn.ua reported. Zelenskiy\u2019s office has denied it planned to remove Zaluzhnyi and the country\u2019s defence ministry said the reports were \u201cnot true\u201d in a post on social media. Zelenskiy himself has not commented on the reports \u2013 which some have seen as a leak to test public opinion about the idea of a change in military leadership. Differences between the two men were thrust into the spotlight last year, when Zaluzhnyi said the war had ground to a stalemate in a high-profile interview with the Economist. Zelenskiy publicly rejected that assertion, in the first sign of a possible rift between the president and his commander-in-chief. In Moscow on Wednesday, Peskov said the possible standoff was the inevitable result of Ukraine\u2019s bogged-down armed forces. He said: It\u2019s obvious that the failed counteroffensive and problems on the fronts are leading to growing differences between representatives of the Kyiv regime \u2013 both the military leadership and the civilian one. These differences will grow as Russia\u2019s special operation continues successfully. Neither side has made a significant territorial gain in more than a year. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said on Telegram that 207 Ukrainian soldiers captured by Russia have returned in the prisoner swap deal. He posted: Our people are home. The Russian defence ministry has announced the return of 195 Russian prisoners of war from Ukraine, in exchange for the same number of Ukrainian PoWs. Reuters reports: The Russian defence ministry said in a statement on Wednesday it had completed an exchange deal with Ukraine under which each side got 195 soldiers back and that its own soldiers would be flown to Moscow to receive medical and psychological treatment. It was cited by the RIA state news agency as saying that the United Arab Emirates had played a role in brokering the deal. \u201cOn January 31, as a result of the negotiation process, 195 Russian servicemen who were in mortal danger in captivity were returned from territory controlled by the Kyiv regime. In return, exactly 195 prisoners from the armed forces of Ukraine were handed over,\u201d the defence ministry said in a statement. It was the first such exchange since the crash of a Russian military transport plane last week that Moscow says was carrying 65 Ukrainian soldiers ahead of a planned exchange. Russia says Ukraine shot down the plane with a ground-to-air missile and that all 74 people on board were killed. Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied that it downed the plane, and has demanded proof of who was on board. Here\u2019s a summary of the day so far: Olaf Scholz and four other European leaders admitted that the EU has \u201cfallen short\u201d of its goals to supply Ukraine with artillery ammunition on the eve of an emergency EU summit of EU leaders designed to break the deadlock between member states and Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n over a \u00a350bn aid package. The EU must show \u201cclear commitment\u201d to Ukraine, which needs more ammunition, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said before a meeting with EU defence ministers in Brussels. The Kremlin said that it was monitoring the situation around Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine\u2019s top military commander, after western and Ukrainian media outlets said President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was trying to oust Zaluzhny. Russia\u2019s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, told military manufacturers to \u201cstop fooling around\u201d and further increase the production of self-propelled artillery systems during a visit to arms-producing factories in the Urals. Ukraine\u2019s air defences shot down 14 out of 20 drones launched by Russia in an overnight attack that injured one person and damaged commercial buildings, the military has said. The United Nations\u2019 top court will rule today on whether Russia violated an anti-terrorism treaty by funding pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine, including those who shot down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in 2014. Kyiv says Russia also violated a human rights treaty by discriminating against ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea, the peninsula which Russia declared annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine had asked the International Court of Justice to find Russia guilty of breaching obligations under the two UN treaties, which both countries have signed, and to order it to pay reparations. In a hearing at the court in The Hague last June, Russia dismissed Ukraine\u2019s allegations as fiction and \u201cblatant lies\u201c. Lawyers for Moscow denied systematic human rights abuses in Ukrainian territory that it occupies and rejected the accusation that it violated the U.N. treaty against the financing of terrorism. Kyiv took Russia to the United Nations highest court in 2017, before Russia\u2019s full scale invasion. In the case, which has taken almost seven years, Russia is accused of equipping and funding pro-Russian forces, including rebels who shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 in July 2014, killing all 298 passengers and crew. In Crimea, Ukraine says Russia was trying to erase the culture of ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians. The court\u2019s judgments are final and without appeal but it has no way to enforce its rulings. The US under secretary of state for political affairs, Victoria Nuland, arrived in Ukraine on Wednesday for talks amid growing uncertainty over US economic and military assistance to Kyiv as the war with Russia approaches its third year. The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, said on social media platform X: \u201cToday we will meet government leaders, veterans and civil society to underscore our shared commitment to defeating Russian aggression in Ukraine.\u201d She published a picture of Nuland at Kyiv\u2019s central railway station. So far this year, Kyiv has not received military or financial aid from its two main backers, the US and EU. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s chief of staff has said that the postponement of US assistance for Kyiv being debated in Congress would create a \u201cbig risk\u201d of Ukraine losing the war with Russia. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration asked Congress in October 2023 for nearly $106bn to fund ambitious plans for Ukraine, Israel and US border security, but Republicans who control the House with a slim majority have opposed the package. Olaf Scholz and four other European leaders have admitted that the EU has \u201cfallen short\u201d of its goals to supply Ukraine with artillery ammunition, writes the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll. On the eve of an emergency EU summit of EU leaders designed to break the deadlock between member states and Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n over a \u00a350bn aid package, they have warned that Europe needs to intensify and accelerate its supplies to the frontline. The leaders wrote in a letter published in the Financial Times on Wednesday: \u201cAt the beginning of last year, the EU committed itself to an ambitious goal of supplying Ukraine with 1m artillery rounds before the end of March 2024. The hard truth: we have fallen short of this goal. \u201cRussia doesn\u2019t wait for anybody and we need to act now. If Ukraine loses, the long-term consequences and costs will be much higher for all of us. We Europeans have a special responsibility. Therefore, we must act. Europe\u2019s future depends on it. The European Commission proposed on Wednesday measures to limit agricultural imports from Ukraine and greater flexibility towards rules on fallow land in a bid to quell protests by angry farmers in France and other EU members. The commission said it would extend the suspension of import duties on Ukrainian exports for another year to June 2025. They were originally suspended in 2022 to help support Ukraine\u2019s economy following Russia\u2019s invasion. French and Belgian farmers have set up dozens of blockades on highways and on access roads to a major container port on Wednesday to press governments to ease environmental rules and help protect them from rising costs and cheap imports. The Kremlin said on Wednesday that it was monitoring the situation around Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine\u2019s top military commander, after western and Ukrainian media outlets said President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was trying to oust Zaluzhny. The media reports, attributed to unnamed sources with knowledge of the matter, said that Zelenskiy in a meeting on Monday had offered Zaluzhny, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, a new role but that the general had refused. Commenting on the situation around Zaluzhny, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: Of course we are following this. There are still a lot of questions. [But] one thing remains obvious \u2013 the Kyiv regime has a lot of problems, things are not going well there. It is obvious that the failed [summer] counter-offensive and the problems on the front are leading to growing contradictions among the representatives of this Kyiv regime. These contradictions will grow as the special military operation continues to be successful. European Union leaders will propose on Thursday holding an annual debate on a planned \u20ac50bn aid package for Ukraine in an effort to overcome opposition from Hungary, according to draft summit conclusions. The aid is to cover Ukraine\u2019s needs for 2024-2027. Hungary has been pushing for an annual review with a veto right, which other EU members oppose. In a new update to the draft summit conclusions, the EU leaders would hold yearly debates on the aid package based on reports by the European Commission. The January 30 draft conclusions, seen by Reuters, say: The European Council will hold a debate each year on the implementation of the facility with a view to providing guidance on the EU approach towards the situation stemming from Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine. Russia\u2019s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has told military manufacturers to \u201cstop fooling around\u201d and further increase the production of self-propelled artillery systems. Shoigu visited arms-producing factories in the Urals industrial city of Yekaterinburg on Tuesday and said Russia was increasing production of air defence missiles after a series of Ukrainian drone attacks that have targeted cities and energy infrastructure. In video published by news site RBC on Wednesday from Shoigu\u2019s factories tour, he chided the management of one plant for not producing enough self-propelled artillery. He told the plant\u2019s bosses Listen, stop fooling around here, guys. We got busy with this in 2022. We should have had these machines operating at full capacity in 2023. I\u2019d like to receive within a week a specific proposal on how we\u2019ll reach the indicators set by the president (Vladimir Putin) ... this must be done, because all these orders are connected with the performance of very specific work on the battlefield. The director said the factory had already increased production six-fold in the last two years. Russia has placed its economy on a war footing and shifted defence plants to round-the clock production to meet the needs of its forces in Ukraine. Its defence industry will supply the army with \u201cseveral times\u201d more military equipment this year than in 2022 and 2023, Interfax news quoted Deputy Defence Minister Alexei Krivoruchko as saying this month. The Russian anti-war candidate Boris Nadezhdin has said he submitted 105,000 signatures in his support to the Central Election Commission (CEC) to underpin his bid to challenge Vladimir Putin in an upcoming presidential election. Reuters reports: The CEC will check the authenticity and quality of the signatures submitted by Nadezhdin and other would-be candidates and announce next month who will join Putin on the ballot paper. Putin\u2019s victory is widely seen as a foregone conclusion, but Nadezhdin has surprised observers with his trenchant criticism of what the Kremlin calls its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine. After a series of heating outages across Russia during an unusually cold winter, Nadezhdin said earlier this month that the country would be able to afford to spend more on its citizens if it was not pouring so much money into the military. As a candidate nominated by a political party, he needed to gather 100,000 signatures across at least 40 regions in order to stand in the 15-17 March election. Putin, who has chosen to run as an independent rather than as the candidate of the ruling United Russia party, needs 300,000 signatures but has already collected more than 3.5m, according to his supporters. The Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, has said there are no talks, neither with Ukraine nor the European Union, about an extension of the Russian gas transit deal, which expires in the end of 2024. Under the five-year deal agreed between Moscow and Kyiv in 2019, Russia exports gas to Europe via Ukraine and pays Ukraine for the usage of its pipeline network. China\u2019s new defence minister, Dong Jun, held a video call with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, today, according to a defence ministry statement, in his first public engagement since being appointed last month. Reuters reports: Former navy chief Dong\u2019s appointment came after his predecessor, Li Shangfu, disappeared from public view in August, throwing China\u2019s military diplomacy in doubt. Dong told Shoigu that the Chinese and Russian militaries will \u201cpromote bilateral military relations to reach an even higher level, in order to play an even bigger role in upholding global security and stability\u201d, according to the Chinese defence ministry readout. Dong added that both militaries will \u201cfirmly respond to global challenges and continue to enhance mutual strategic trust\u201d. The role of China\u2019s defence minister is to be the public face of the People\u2019s Liberation Army in its engagement with the media and with other armed forces. China and Russia\u2019s close military ties have been the target of western scrutiny, especially after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which Beijing has refused to condemn. The Swedishprime minister, Ulf Kristersson, has said he will meet his Hungarian counterpart in Brussels on Thursday, though no time has been set for a formal meeting. Kristersson told reporters: We will meet there (Brussels) and have a decent chance to have a chat before a meeting later. Hungary is the only Nato member not to approve Sweden\u2019s application yet. Ukraine needs more ammunition, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said before a meeting with EU defence ministers in Brussels. We have to show that our clear commitment with Ukraine remains and continues. He added that it was important to clarify the situation and \u201cknow where we are now, where we will be by March and by the end of the year\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s air defences shot down 14 out of 20 drones launched by Russia in an overnight attack that injured one person and damaged commercial buildings, the military said on Wednesday. The Air Force said in a statement the Iranian-made Shahed drones and also three Iskander missiles targeted five Ukrainian regions in the south and the east. The southern military command said one person was injured and agricultural warehouses and a shop were damaged in the Mykolayiv region where five drones were shot down. Details on damage in other regions were not immediately available. The UN\u2019s top court will hand down its verdict today in a case brought by Ukraine against Russia for alleged terrorism financing and racial discrimination after its annexation of Crimea in 2014. Agence France-Presse reports: Kyiv has accused Moscow of being a terrorist state whose support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine was a harbinger of the full-fledged 2022 invasion. It wants Russia to compensate all civilians caught up in the conflict, as well as victims from Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine. The case predates Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The international court of justice (ICJ) will decide on Friday whether it has jurisdiction to rule in a separate case over that war. Russia is also in the dock for alleged breaches of an international convention on racial discrimination due to its treatment of the Tatar minority and Ukrainian speakers in occupied Crimea. During hearings on the case, Alexander Shulgin, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the Netherlands, accused Ukraine of \u201cblatant lies and false accusations \u2026 even to this court\u201d. Top Ukrainian diplomat Anton Korynevych retorted that Russia was trying to \u201cwipe us off the map\u201d. He said: Beginning in 2014, Russia illegally occupied Crimea and then engaged in a campaign of cultural erasure, taking aim at ethnic Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars. The case started in 2017 and has seen lengthy exchanges in the ICJ\u2019s Great Hall of Justice, plus thousands of pages of documents submitted to the judges. Ukraine has also taken Moscow to court over maritime law and alleged human rights abuses. In 2017, the ICJ rejected Kyiv\u2019s initial request for emergency measures to halt Russia\u2019s funding of separatists. However it did order Moscow to refrain from imposing \u201climitations\u201d on the Crimean Tatars or the use of Ukrainian on the peninsula. The ICJ, based in The Hague, rules on disputes between states, and is separate from the international criminal court (ICC), which prosecutes war crimes by individuals. ICJ rulings are final and cannot be subject to appeal but it has little power to enforce them. For example, it issued an emergency ruling ordering Russia to halt its invasion one month after tanks rolled over the border \u2013 to no avail. Today\u2019s Guardian live coverage of the war in Ukraine starts here. Let\u2019s go through the major developments: Volodymyr Zelenskiy asked his most senior military commander, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, to step down but the popular general refused, triggering speculation that he might be dismissed by the president amid tensions between them. Oleksii Goncharenko, a Ukrainian opposition MP and ally of the general, told the Guardian that he understood that \u201cyesterday the president asked Zaluzhnyi to resign but he declined to do so\u201d. Ukraine will soon receive the first big batch of long-range missiles made by Boeing and Saab that promise to extend its range deep into Russian-held territory, according to reports. Ukraine needs the ground launched small diameter bomb (GLSDB) to supplement its 100-mile Atacms rockets from the US. EU nations have decided to approve an outline deal that would deliver Ukraine the taxes and profits from hundreds of billions of dollars in Russian central bank assets that have been frozen outside Russia because of its war against Ukraine. It is seen as a first step towards using the Russian assets \u2013 there are also calls to seize the entire sum outright for Ukraine\u2019s benefit. Peers have criticised the UK government for failing to agree a deal with the former Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich to spend \u00a32.5bn from his sale of the London football club. EU leaders will meet on Thursday hoping to approve \u20ac50bn in support for Ukraine over the solitary opposition of the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who is an ally of Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. Russian attack drones hit Ukraine\u2019s second largest city, Kharkiv, on Tuesday, slightly injuring three people, triggering a fire and causing damage to apartment blocks and infrastructure, local officials said. Ukraine said it had carried out a successful cyber-attack that knocked out a server used by Russia\u2019s defence ministry, temporarily disrupting communications for military units. Ukraine is likely to face a tough year fighting Russia in 2024, the CIA director, Bill Burns, has written in Foreign Policy, arguing that to cut off US aid would be an error of \u201chistoric proportions\u201d. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Tuesday that European countries must get ready to help Ukraine keep fighting \u201cover the long term\u201d, with or without American help. \u201cIf the United States were to make a sovereign choice to stop or reduce this aid, it should have no impact on the ground.\u201d The head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, has said he expects Russia\u2019s offensive on the eastern frontline to fizzle out by early spring. He credited them with only \u201ca few advances across some fields\u201d and near Avdiivka. \u201cNow it\u2019s the enemy\u2019s move. It will end, and I think ours will start.\u201d A Ukrainian military spy official said on Tuesday that Russia was showing no willingness to return the bodies of dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war that it said died in a military plane crash in the Belgorod region last week. Russia has produced no proof there were Ukrainian prisoners on the plane. The Ukrainian government submitted to parliament on Tuesday an amended version of its bill to tighten army mobilisation rules. The parliament rejected the previous draft amid public outcry. A key provision in the legislation is a lowering to 25 from 27 the minimum age for the draft. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the army needs 450,000-500,000 more personnel. There is growing evidence that Russia is using \u201cshadow tanker fleets\u201d to circumvent a western oil price cap, a committee of Britain\u2019s House of Lords has warned. Agence France-Presse reports: Arguing Britain and its allies must maintain sanctions and military support for Ukraine for \u201cas long as it takes\u201d, the Lords committee urged \u201cdecisive action\u201d. A year ago the G7, European Union and Australia imposed the unprecedented price cap on Russian oil, hoping to starve President Vladimir Putin of revenue while ensuring he still supplied the global market. Initially successful, the US$60 (\u00a347) per barrel price ceiling on Russian oil lost its impact once Moscow found new buyers and new tankers. Companies based in the EU, G7 member states and Australia are banned from providing services enabling maritime transport, such as insurance, of oil above that price. Recent assessments show Moscow has reduced its dependence on western shipping services and skirted the curb by building so-called shadow fleets of tankers and buying old ships while offering its own insurance. The Lords\u2019 European affairs committee reported: We are concerned at the growing evidence that Russia has been able to circumvent sanctions, including through third states and uninsured shadow tanker fleets. This is an issue where decisive action by the UK and its allies is needed. The committee urged the government to detail \u201cspecific examples\u201d of enforcement action. But the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) is the latest to highlight the extent to which Russia is now able to get around the mechanism. In its December Russian oil tracker report released this month, it estimated \u201c179 loaded Russian shadow fleet tankers left Russian ports in November 2023\u201d. Around 70% of the vessels were built more than 15 years ago, it said. In October 2023, the shadow fleet was responsible for exports of around 2.3m barrels per day of crude oil and 800,000m barrels per day of petroleum products, according to the KSE. The Lords committee welcomed the western sanctions regime imposed on Moscow since its invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, in particular that it had been \u201cbroadly aligned\u201d, but warned: Divergence between sanctions regimes results in gaps and loopholes, weakening their effectiveness; it should be as limited as possible."

            "date": "2024-01-30T08:00:23Z",
            "content": "A Guardian investigation has detailed the mass destruction of buildings and land in three neighbourhoods in Gaza. Using satellite imagery and open-source evidence, the investigation found damage to more than 250 residential buildings, 17 schools and universities, 16 mosques, three hospitals, three cemeteries and 150 agricultural greenhouses. Entire buildings have been levelled, fields flattened and places of worship wiped off the map in the course of Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza, launched after the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October. The destruction has not only forced 1.9 million people to leave their homes but also made it impossible for many to return. This has led some experts to describe what is happening in Gaza as \u201cdomicide\u201d, defined as the widespread, deliberate destruction of the home to make it uninhabitable, preventing the return of displaced people. The concept is not recognised in law. The Israeli military says that its fight is against Hamas and not Gaza, that its bombardment is proportional to the threat posed by Hamas and that it is making every effort to warn citizens of imminent attacks. An IDF spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cHamas operates nearby, underneath, and within densely populated areas as a matter of routine operational practice. As part of the IDF\u2019s operations, it [has] been carrying out strikes on military targets, as well as locating and destroying infrastructure when imperatively required to achieve the goals of the war.\u201d Rajagopal, Azzouz and Coward all said the evidence in the Guardian investigation was in line with their understanding of events in Gaza as a form of domicide. \u201cThe utter annihilation of Beit Hanoun and the destruction of al-Zahra and Khan Younis, are evidence that Israeli use of force has made life impossible by making them uninhabitable,\u201d said Rajagopal, the UN rapporteur. \u201cAll that matters to live a dignified and secure life is destroyed and that is not legal or legitimate under any sense of a law-based world.\u201d Coward, the Queen Mary University professor, said: \u201cThe destruction of homes plays a key role in both the displacement \u2013 communities cannot return if they have no home to return to \u2013 and the destruction of communities, as homes are destroyed and families displaced so all the things that make a community cohesive are destroyed and they are scattered to many different places.\u201d Azzouz said: \u201cThe Guardian investigation shows how Israel weaponises architecture in Gaza, destroying Palestinians\u2019 cultural heritage sites and their everyday urban fabric.\u201d Corey Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek estimate that between 142,900 and 176,900 buildings had been damaged as of 17 January, which raises questions on how to rehabilitate Gaza when the war ends. Coward added: \u201cLooking at the images of al-Zahra, Khan Yunis and Beit Hanoun there is widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure such as schools, universities and shops. This destruction not only kills and displaces civilians, it destroys the sense that these places are home to a particular way of life. If you can\u2019t shop or learn, you can\u2019t form a sense of belonging or call a place home.\u201d Methodology Satellite imagery has been sourced from Planet Labs. Images prior to the 2023 conflict were taken in May 2023, while the damage evidence presented is from images taken on 30 November and 31 December 2023 and 5 January 2024. Satellite imagery from other dates was used for verification purposes. Some satellite imagery has also been sourced from Copernicus Sentinel. The videos of the Beit Hanoun school and the Turkish-Palestinian friendship hospital were taken from social media footage that the Guardian has verified. The footage from the car in Beit Hanoun and the footage of the Khaled bin al-Walid mosque in Khan Younis were released by Reuters. The drone footage of the al-Zahra residential area was released by Getty. The footage of the street in Khan Younis was released by Associated Press. Damaged areas have been verified against satellite imagery, user-generated multimedia footage, news reports or IDF updates. The analysis by Corey Scher of the City University of New York and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University only covers building damage, while the Guardian\u2019s assessment also recorded agricultural damage. To establish the existence and identity of particular areas or buildings, the Guardian used a variety of sources including UNOSAT damage analysis, social media, local news reports, company websites, Planet Labs, Open Street Maps, MapCarta, WikiMapia, Google Earth, Google Maps and satellites.pro. An area was confirmed as damaged only if two or more reporters managed to verify it."

Russia launched drone and missile attacks targeting civilian and critical infrastructure across wide areas of Ukraine, Kyiv\u2019s air force said on Sunday. Preliminary information did not show any casualties in the attacks, but Russia and Ukraine have increased their air attacks on each other\u2019s territory in recent months, targeting critical military, energy and transport infrastructure. The air force said on the Telegram messaging app that Russia attacked the central Poltava region with two ballistic missiles fired from the Iskander ballistic missile system, and three surface-to-air missiles over the Donetsk region in the east.

Residents of Melitopol in the Zaporizhzhia oblast are reporting hearing two loud explosions, Melitopol\u2019s mayor, Ivan Fedorov, said. The explosions took place in the Berdyansk district. An 89-year-old woman was injured today in a Russian attack in the Kherson oblast, the regional military administration said. Russian forces struck the settlement of Mykhailivka in the Berislav district eight times, with one shell hitting the yard of a residential building. The woman is receiving treatment for injuries to her abdomen. In Kyiv, relatives of Ukrainian service personnel are calling on the government to set a time limit on how their loved ones should serve in the military. Ukraine\u2019s security service has released an image related to the agency\u2019s investigation into the defence ministry officials who allegedly conspired with employees from a Ukrainian arms firm to embezzle almost $40m earmarked to buy 100,000 mortar shells. My colleague Luke Harding in Kyiv is reporting that five people who allegedly tried to steal nearly $40m (\u00a331m) that was supposed to be used to buy shells for the Ukrainian military have been arrested. The security service said it had arrested two senior officials from the ministry of defence who allegedly conspired with the chief executive of a little-known arms firm, Lviv Arsenal, over a contract for 100,000 mortar shells.

At the outset of the conflict, the company said it was stopping investment in Russia, where it has a large worker base, and was ending exports from its Russian factory to other parts of the world. It said it would not close operations entirely because there were local workers dependent on the jobs. \u201cWe believe restricting their access to products would have an outsize impact on women and children there,\u201d said the company, which is part of the Brazilian cosmetics company Natura &amp; Co. However, research by the BBC has discovered the company is still recruiting new sales agents in Russia, with recruits offered prizes, cash bonuses and even holidays for hitting targets, the broadcaster reports. This was criticised heavily by researchers and campaigners, who accused Avon of \u201cmoral-washing\u201d in Russia, where it is the number one perfume brand. Steven Tian, part of a team of researchers at Yale University who track what companies have done in response to the Ukraine war, told the BBC the company should be \u201cashamed\u201d of continuing to invest in the country. \u201cThere is no excuse for continuing to fund Putin\u2019s war machine \u2026 and [there] has been more than enough time to allow for companies to exit in an orderly way,\u201d he said.

Three civilians, including a teenage boy, were wounded in an overnight Russian strike in the Donetsk oblast, according to the office of Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general. Russian troops launched a rocket attack on a residential area in the city of Myrnograd at about 1.30am, injuring a 15-year-old boy and a 35-year-old man in their own homes. A 30-year-old resident of a neighbouring house sustained a brain injury. The attack damaged 14 apartment buildings and educational institutions and nine cars. Russian air defence shot down a Ukrainian drone over the Bryansk oblast today, regional governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram. There were no casualties. The hacking group NoName05716 claims to be preparing to target Ukrainian government with help from other hacking groups 22\u0421, Skillnet, CyberDragon, Federal Legion, People\u2019s Cyber Army and Phoenix. Cyber-attacks have been an area of concern for Ukrainian officials since the start of the war, with the contact group on defence of Ukraine forming an IT coalition of 12 countries. There have been 220 attacks on Russian military enlistment offices since the start of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, the UK defence ministry said in its daily intelligence briefing. Since July 2023, there have been 113 incidents \u2013 a doubling of arson attacks on enlistment offices over the past six months. While Sergey Naryshkin, the director of the Russian foreign intelligence service, has accused those responsible for the arson attacks as acting on the behest of western officials, the UK defence ministry believes that \u201cthe increase in attacks is highly likely due to a greater sense of dissatisfaction with the war amongst the Russian population\u201d. Some of those accused of perpetrating the attacks have been charged with terrorism and treason. Russian forces launched three missiles, eight drone strikes and 82 shellings on Ukrainian troops and civilian infrastructure over the past day, the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said in its morning briefing. More than 100 settlements in the Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv oblasts came under fire. Defence ministry officials conspired with employees from a Ukrainian arms firm to embezzle almost $40m earmarked to buy 100,000 mortar shells, Ukraine\u2019s security service said. The Associated Press reports that five people have been charged, with one person detained trying to cross the Ukrainian border. If found guilty, they face up to 12 years in prison. The investigation dates back to August 2022, when officials signed a contract for artillery shells worth 1.5bn hryvnias ($39.6m) with the arms firm Lviv Arsenal, the security service said. Company employees were supposed to transfer the funds to a business registered abroad, which would then deliver the ammunition to Ukraine. But the goods were never delivered and the money was instead sent to various accounts in Ukraine and the Balkans, investigators said. The funds have since been seized and will be returned to the country\u2019s defence budget, Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general said. Corruption has been a major roadblock in Kyiv\u2019s bid to joint the European Union and Nato, with officials from both blocs demanding widespread anti-graft reforms before Kyiv can join them. Volodymyr Zelenskiy was elected on an anti-corruption platform. His administration has portrayed the recent firings of top officials, notably that of Ivan Bakanov, the former head of the state security service, in July 2022, as proof of their efforts to crack down on graft. Russian forces attacked eight communities in the Sumy oblast overnight, causing more than 24 explosions, the Sumy regional military administration said. Shellings of the border territories and settlements of the Sumy oblast brought the Bilopolska, Shalyginska, Esmanska and Druzhbivska communities under fire. Russian mortar shelling hit the Esman and Druzhbiv communities, as well as the Bilopol community that was also targeted by artillery shelling and a BMD cannon. Meanwhile, the Shalyginsk community experienced a small arms fire. Russian forces targeted parts of the Kharkiv oblast throughout yesterday and this morning, injuring several and damaging buildings, said Oleg Synegubov, head of the Kharkiv regional state administration. A 77-year-old woman was injured and hospitalised in an attack on the city of Vovchans\u2019k. Russian shelling injured a 61-year-old man in Kozacha Lopan. Two men, 42 and 50, were hospitalised following an attack on the Kupyan district. In total, 20 settlements were attacked, Synegubov said. Russia launched drone and missile attacks targeting civilian and critical infrastructure across wide areas of Ukraine, Kyiv\u2019s air force said on Sunday. Reuters reports it said preliminary information did not show any casualties in the attacks. Russia and Ukraine have increased their air attacks on each other\u2019s territory in recent months, targeting critical military, energy and transport infrastructure. The air force said on the Telegram messaging app that Russia attacked the central Poltava region with two ballistic missiles fired from the Iskander ballistic missile system, and three surface-to-air missiles over the Donetsk region in the east. Filip Pronin, governor of Poltava region, wrote on Telegram that the attack struck an industrial site in the city of Kremenchuk, sparking a fire. Pictures posted on social media showed emergency crews battling a blaze. Further south-east in the Zaporizhzhia region, the governor, Yuri Malashko, said an infrastructure site had been hit in a drone attack. Emergency crews were at the site, Malashko said, but gave no details of damage or casualties. Ukraine\u2019s air defence systems destroyed four of eight Russia-launched drones overnight, the air force said. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. There was no immediate comment from Russia. Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. Here is an overview of the latest developments. Russia launched drone and missile attacks targeting civilian and critical infrastructure across wide areas of Ukraine, Kyiv\u2019s air force said on Sunday. Preliminary information did not show any casualties, it said. Russia attacked the central Poltava region with two ballistic missiles, and three surface-to-air missiles over the Donetsk region in the east. Ukraine\u2019s air defence systems destroyed four of eight Russia-launched drones overnight, the air force said. More on that story soon. In other news: A Russian \u201creconnaissance and sabotage group\u201d shot dead two people \u2013 a brother and sister \u2013 in a Ukrainian village on Saturday during a cross-border incursion, local officials said. The attack in Andriivka occurred in Ukraine\u2019s Sumy region inside a 5km (three-mile) buffer zone along the border with Russia \u2013 an area where Kyiv had asked residents to evacuate. The victims were a 54-year-old man and a 68-year-old woman who were killed while driving in an SUV, Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general said. At least three other civilians were killed in Russian attacks in the east and south of the country, local officials said on Saturday. In Beryslav, in the southern Kherson region, explosives dropped from a drone killed one person, the governor said. Two were killed by Russian artillery shelling in the eastern Donetsk region, Ukraine\u2019s national police said. Ukraine\u2019s SBU security service said it had uncovered a corruption scheme in the purchase of arms by the country\u2019s military totalling the equivalent of about $40m (\u00a331.5m/\u20ac37m). Saturday\u2019s announcement of mass procurement fraud, confirmed by Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry, will have a huge resonance in the country amid Russia\u2019s invasion, with the fight to root out corruption remaining a major issue as Kyiv presses its bid to secure membership in the European Union, reports Reuters. Ukrainian counterattacks were holding Russians back from taking full control of Avdiivka, the UK Ministry of Defence said. Russian forces had suffered heavy personnel and armoured vehicle losses, frequently caused by Ukrainian uncrewed aerial vehicle munitions, the ministry outlined in an intelligence update. The forces continued to attempt to bypass Ukrainian fortifications by entering the city edges via service tunnels but \u201cUkrainian counterattacks are holding Russian forces from progressing further within the city\u201d. The Biden administration has announced the approval of a $23bn deal to sell F-16 warplanes to Turkey, after Ankara ratified Sweden\u2019s Nato membership, the US state department said. Ukraine has pressed Russia to provide proof that a military plane shot down during the week had been carrying dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war, as it claimed. The latest twist in the row over the incident came as Ukrainian officials said a Russian raid had killed two civilians near their border. Ukraine\u2019s spy chief, Kyrylo Budanov, questioned on state TV why Russia had not shown any images of the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers that Moscow claims were killed when the plane was shot down. Kyiv has confirmed a prisoner exchange was to take place that day. President Vladimir Putin said Ukraine \u201cglorifies\u201d Adolf Hitler\u2019s SS killing squads and vowed to \u201ceradicate Nazism\u201d as he opened a memorial marking 80 years since the end of the siege of Leningrad. The Russian leader has repeatedly invoked the Soviet Union\u2019s victory over Nazi Germany in the second world war to justify the war against Ukraine. His charge that Ukraine is a fascist state that needs \u201cdenazifying\u201d has been debunked as false by independent experts. Joe Biden will host the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, at the White House on 9 February to discuss aid to Ukraine. It comes as the US president has been pressing Congress to embrace a bipartisan Senate deal to pair border enforcement measures with aid for Ukraine. The talks have hit a critical point as Republican opposition mounts. The US is planning to station nuclear weapons in the UK for the first time in 15 years amid a growing threat from Russia, according to a report. Warheads three times as strong as the Hiroshima bomb would be located at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk under the proposals, Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph reported."

            "title": "Why are European defence leaders talking about war?",
            "date": "2024-01-26T05:00:22Z",
            "content": "A wave of anxiety has gripped European defence ministers and armed forces as politicians and military leaders believe that Nato-sceptic Donald Trump could be elected as the next president of the US \u2013 and that Russia may not be forced out or defeated in Ukraine. This febrile mood has prompted growing warnings that Europe could find itself involved in a war in Russia, even though at present Russia is embroiled in Ukraine. At the same time, tensions in the Middle East have continued to rise. Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza continues; hostilities with Iran-aligned Hezbollah in Lebanon increase; and the US and the UK launched bombing raids on Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen to halt raids on shipping in the Red Sea. What are politicians and generals saying? Adm Rob Bauer, the chair of Nato\u2019s military committee, said last week that it was \u201cnot a given that we are in peace\u201d and that was \u201cwhy we are preparing for a conflict with Russia and the terror groups if it comes to it\u201d before the start of what the military alliance said was its largest exercise in decades, involving 90,000 troops. Grant Shapps, the British defence secretary, used even stronger language, arguing the cold war peace dividend was over and that the UK and its allies were \u201cmoving from a postwar to a prewar world\u201d with idealism replaced by \u201chard-headed realism\u201d. It was time, he argued, for re-armament to protect Europe from \u201cPutin\u2019s fury\u201d. Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister, gave an interview last week suggesting that while a Russian attack was not likely for now \u201cour experts expect a period of five to eight years in which this could be possible\u201d. Europe, he added, was \u201cdealing with a military threat situation \u2026 that has not existed for 30 years\u201d. Norway and Sweden have also made similar warnings in the past month. Isn\u2019t this just scaremongering by militaries wanting more money? Planning for warfare, a remote contingency, is what militaries do and there is always pressure from generals and defence ministries to spend more. But the war in Ukraine \u2013 which will have run for two years next month \u2013 is exhausting western stockpiles of munitions. It looks increasingly likely, meanwhile, that the US Congress will not vote through a new $61bn (\u00a348bn) military aid package for Ukraine as Republicans ratchet up the pressure over a quid-pro-quo deal to boost security on the US southern border. A wave of western weapons given so far to Ukraine, including German Leopard 2 and British Challenger 2 tanks; US Bradley fighting vehicles; American, British and French long-range rocket artillery, as well as ammunition and artillery shells have failed to make a dent in the Russian frontlines \u2013 and, if future US military aid were to halt as a result of the deadlock in Congress, Europe would struggle to make up the gap. Experts fear that without the US, Russia could gradually turn the tables. At the same time, Trump looks set to sweep the Republican nomination after primary victories in Iowa and New Hampshire. Memories of his previous presidency linger in Europe, amid questions about the closeness of his relationship with Putin and his threat at the Nato summit in 2018 that the US might \u201cgo it alone\u201d and quit if other countries did not lift their own military spending. What could this mean for Nato? Manfred Weber, leader of the conservative European People\u2019s party in the European parliament, used an interview in Politico on Thursday to promote the idea that the EU should take over from Nato in defending the continent, proposing \u201ca European pillar of defence\u201d that should include a nuclear umbrella, provided by France, the only nuclear-armed state in the EU. \u201cWhen I look at this year as a European politician, the first thing that goes through our minds is Trump,\u201d he said. There is talk among some EU politicians about the need to create an EU defence commissioner, but the reality is that this manoeuvring is unlikely to supplant Nato, whose members with large militaries include the UK (whose own nuclear weapons are pledged to the alliance) and Turkey as well as the US. Nato members are more likely to try to bed down and endure a Trump presidency as they did from 2016. Could there really be a wider war with Russia? Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, the head of the British army, suggested that the UK\u2019s professional army was too small to last long in an all-out war with Russia and it would take a \u201ccitizen army\u201d to win one, hinting at a return to conscription in an all-out emergency. Though that scenario was rejected by Downing St as a \u201cnot helpful\u201d hypothetical, other European countries such as Latvia and Sweden have been reviving forms of military service, and Pistorius said in December he was \u201clooking at all options\u201d. But it is far from clear that Russia, however aggressive Putin wants to be, would have the capacity to attack Nato member states. It is estimated by western intelligence that 315,000 Russians have been killed or injured in Ukraine and Moscow\u2019s forces have failed repeatedly to break through its smaller neighbour. The anxiety about US support may be real, but the threat is not so significant."

            "title": "Is Ecuador at war with its armed gangs?",
            "date": "2024-01-10T14:29:12Z",
            "content": "At about 2pm local time on Tuesday, a live news broadcast on an Ecuadorian TV channel was interrupted by a group of masked men carrying guns, grenades and sticks of dynamite. The intruders pointed guns at employees and made them lie on the floor. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot, please don\u2019t shoot,\u201d one person shouted. One of the attackers said the attack was the result of \u201cmessing with the mafias\u201d. The TC Televisi\u00f3n broadcast continued for at least 15 minutes. Then the signal was cut off. Thirteen gunmen were later arrested, and the hostages taken to safety. The astonishing scenes in the city of Guayaquil were part of a series of audacious coordinated attacks by members of Ecuadorian gangs that have killed at least 10 people. They follow the prison escape of the country\u2019s most feared gang leader, Adolfo Mac\u00edas, and the new president, Daniel Noboa\u2019s subsequent declaration of a state of emergency. And while the situation is evolving rapidly, it appears to represent a declaration of war on the country\u2019s fragile democratic institutions. What happened on Tuesday? As well as the attack on the TV studio, a series of apparently related incidents took place across Ecuador. At least seven police officers were kidnapped. A vehicle was set ablaze at a petrol station in the capital, Quito. Explosives were used in further attacks in the provinces of Esmereldas and Los R\u00edos. There was a jailbreak in the city of Riobamba. Five hospitals were also taken over. All of this followed riots in at least six jails on Monday, with guards taken hostage and threatened with death if soldiers were deployed to take control. Videos disseminated on WhatsApp purported to show guards being lynched, though they were unconfirmed. As schools, shops and public buildings closed down, the streets were in gridlock as people fled to the safety of their homes. Noboa declared a state of emergency. \u201cWe are not going to negotiate with terrorists,\u201d he said. The response from the gangs was unambiguous. In one prison video, a guard read out a message with a gun pointed at his head. \u201cYou declared war, you will get war,\u201d he said. \u201cYou declared a state of emergency. We declare police, civilians and soldiers to be the spoils of war.\u201d Who did this, and why? The immediate spark for the chaos of the last couple of days was the escape on Sunday of Mac\u00edas, alias Fito, from his cell in the prison complex in Guayaquil, the country\u2019s largest city and its chief port. Mac\u00edas is the leader of Los Choneros, one of the most powerful criminal gangs in Ecuador, which is believed to have links to Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa cartel. He was serving a 34-year prison sentence, and previously escaped for several weeks in 2013. He was said to have been tipped off shortly before he was due to be transferred to a maximum-security facility. Mac\u00edas was living in a spacious cell decorated with murals and had been shown in a music video, for The Lion\u2019s Ballad, relaxing in the prison courtyard and petting a fighting cockerel. On Tuesday, Noboa decreed 22 gangs were now classified as terrorist groups. How strong are gangs in Ecuador? Four months ago, Dan Collyns, who is covering the crisis for the Guardian, reported from Guayaquil on Ecuador\u2019s \u201cnightmarish descent into violence\u201d in recent years. The gangs have operated with impunity within the prison system and used jails as bases for their operations. There was a mass hostage-taking in six prisons in September and a wave of violence including car bombs and a dynamite attack on a bridge after a senior gang leader was transferred to a new jail. The increase in violence led to the assassination of presidential candidate, Fernando Villavicencio, who was shot dead in August as he left a campaign event. Villavicencio was an anti-corruption candidate who had accused Los Choneros and Mac\u00edas of threatening him in the days before he was killed. The murder rate in Ecuador has jumped almost 500% since 2016, with police attributing 80% of the killings to gangs, according to the thinktank International Crisis Group, one of the highest rates in the world. Local news reports regularly describe beheadings, public hangings and police assassinations as rivals vie for control of the drug trade. The increase in gang violence has been attributed to the killing of Los Choneros\u2019 previous leader, Jorge Zambrano, in 2020. That sparked a struggle for control over drug-trafficking routes and territory. At least 400 inmates have died in the country\u2019s prisons since 2021. Meanwhile, cartels from as far afield as Albania have sought a piece of the Ecuadorian drug trade and are financing local operations. Central to the chaos has been the export of cocaine, a major source of wealth for Ecuador\u2019s gangs because of increased cultivation in neighbouring Colombia and years of lax policing. How has the government responded to the violence? Noboa, the 35-year-old heir to a banana fortune, won the presidency in October after Villavicencio\u2019s assassination. The centre-right politician pledged a hard line on gang violence. Shortly after Noboa took office, Jaime Enrique SC, the alleged leader of the Los Choneros splinter group Los Lobos, was arrested. That was viewed as a statement of intent and prompted reprisals against local police. Other measures included a policy of naming judges and prosecutors who release captured gang members, and the construction of new maximum-security prisons. Last week, Noboa announced plans for a referendum on further action including an expanded role for the military. In December, he proclaimed the success of his strategy, saying in an interview: \u201cWe have captured leaders of criminal groups in recent weeks, from the most important [groups]. One of the groups \u2026 has even asked for a peace deal.\u201d But the events of this week suggest that such optimism has been premature. After the TV station was stormed, Noboa said Ecuador was now in a state of \u201cinternal armed conflict\u201d."

            "date": "2024-01-16T20:09:39Z",
            "content": "The UN-recognised government of Yemen has urged the UK to change its policy in Gaza and back an immediate ceasefire. The call was made by Ahmad bin Mubarak, the foreign minister of Yemen\u2019s Presidential Leadership Council, during a phone conversation on Tuesday with the British Middle East minister, Lord Ahmad. He said it was imperative that a ceasefire be implemented immediately in Gaza, according to the read-out provided by the Yemeni side. The call means both sides in Yemen\u2019s civil war \u2013 the UN-recognised government and the Houthi rebels \u2013 support an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The UK says it would only support a ceasefire that is sustainable, which is defined by ministers as one reached after Hamas is no longer able to pose a security threat to Israel. On Monday in the Commons the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, insisted no connection should be drawn between Gaza and the US-UK strikes in Yemen, but that is not a widely shared view as the Houthis say they are undertaking strikes on commercial shipping to put pressure on Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. The former Middle East minister Alistair Burt, speaking at a Chatham House seminar in Yemen said: \u201cIs there a connection between what is happening in Yemen and Gaza? Yes there is \u2013 because the Houthis say it is connected.\u201d Farea Al-Muslimi, a Yemen specialist at Chatham House, said he believed the Houthis would end their attacks on commercial shipping if there was a ceasefire in Gaza, but acknowledged this might not be a popular view. Speaking in Davos the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, said: \u201cWe think the priority should be de-escalation in the Red Sea and the entire region.\u201d Asked if the crisis in the Red Sea was connected with the war in Gaza he said \u201cit is clearly connected\u201d. Prince Faisal also said more definitively than before that Saudi Arabia was prepared to normalise relations with Israel on clear conditions. He said: \u201cA ceasefire in the Gaza Strip can be a starting point towards permanent peace [between Israel and the Palestinians] through justice for the Palestinian people. \u201cWe agree that regional peace includes peace for Israel, but that could only happen through peace for the Palestinians through a Palestinian state,\u201d he added. Asked if Saudi Arabia would then recognise Israel as part of a wider political agreement, he said: \u201cCertainly.\u201d Qatar\u2019s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said at the World Economic Forum: \u201cWe need to address the central issue, which is Gaza in order to get everything else defused \u2026 if we are just focusing on the symptoms and not treating the real issues, [solutions] will be temporary.\u201d He added that US and British attacks create \u201ca high risk of further escalation and further expansion\u201d of the conflict."

            "date": "2024-01-31T16:33:32Z",
            "content": "Heavy bombardment of Gaza continued on Wednesday as the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was expected to arrive in Cairo to discuss a ceasefire proposal in the Israel-Gaza war that would reportedly involve the staged release of Israeli hostages. A Hamas official said Haniyeh would be in the Egyptian capital for talks on Wednesday or Thursday, as intense fighting was reported in the south of the territory in Khan Younis and in the north in Gaza City. The health ministry in Gaza said on Wednesday that 26,900 Palestinians had been killed in the territory since the war began on 7 October, following Hamas\u2019s deadly attack on southern Israel, and almost 66,000 people had been injured. Israel said three of its soldiers had been killed in battles in Gaza in the past 24 hours, bringing the total killed since the start of the ground offensive in Gaza to 224. Fighting was heaviest in Khan Younis around the Nasser hospital, the largest hospital still functioning in the southern half of Gaza where thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering, and the residential area of al-Nimsawi, reports said. The Hamas media office said \u201cdozens of air raids\u201d had hit the city overnight and the Palestinian Red Crescent said there was shelling and gunfire around another Khan Younis hospital, al-Amal, where the Palestinian news agency Wafa said \u201carmoured tanks continue to intensively target and surround [it] for the 10th day, amid constant shooting to prevent any movement on the ground\u201d. A 75-year-old woman and a 45-day-old baby had died at al-Amal after suffering a lack of oxygen for several days, and been buried in the hospital compound, the Palestinian Red Crescent said. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said it had been forced to move its operations out of Khan Younis. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a health clinic, major shelters \u2013 facilities that were supporting the people of Khan Younis,\u201d said Thomas White of UNRWA. About 30 bodies were discovered in the grounds of a school in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahia, according to reports. Al Jazeera said it had spoken to witnesses who discovered the decomposing bodies under a mound of rubble while clearing out the grounds of the Khalifa bin Zayed primary school. They were contained in individual body bags with identification tags in Hebrew, unverified pictures showed. It is unclear in what state the bodies were found. The West Bank-based ministry of foreign affairs and Hamas were among those who said the corpses were blindfolded and hands and legs bound with zip ties, indicating they had been summarily executed. However, journalists in the north of Gaza said only one person had claimed that the bodies were handcuffed and blindfolded, and those claims were amplified without verification. No visual evidence has so far emerged. The Israel Defense Forces have reportedly previously removed bodies from morgues and exhumed graves in Gaza to check for high value Hamas members or Israeli hostages. The IDF did not immediately respond to a request for more information. Hamas officials told news agencies the new ceasefire proposal involved a three-stage truce. It would first release the remaining civilians among hostages captured on 7 October, then soldiers, and finally the bodies of dead hostages. Women, children and sick men over the age of 60 would be freed initially, they said. They did not indicate how long the stages would last \u2013 although some reports suggested a six-week truce \u2013 or what would follow the final stage. Israel says 132 of the hostages remain in Gaza including at least 29 believed to have been killed. The plan emerged from talks in Paris involving intelligence chiefs from Israel, the US and Egypt, plus the prime minister of Qatar. Efforts to broker a ceasefire have been under way since an earlier seven-day truce in the fighting in Gaza collapsed. During the lull in fighting in late November, 105 Israeli hostages were freed by Hamas in exchange for the release from Israeli prisons of 240 Palestinians. Hamas has said it will release the remaining hostages only as part of a wider deal to end the war permanently. Responding to speculation about a proposal on Tuesday, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said: \u201cI\u2019ve heard statements about all kinds of deals. So I wish to clarify: we will not end this war with anything less than the achievement of all its objectives. We will not withdraw the IDF from the Gaza Strip and we won\u2019t release thousands of terrorists. None of that is going to happen. What is going to happen? Total victory.\u201d Netanyahu is under pressure from the hostages\u2019 families to bring them home, with many saying he should agree to a negotiated release. But far-right parties in his ruling coalition say they will quit rather than endorse a deal that leaves Hamas intact. Meanwhile, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, appealed to countries to allow UNRWA\u2019s \u201clifesaving work\u201d to continue. A string of western countries, including the US and the UK, have suspended funding to UNRWA after Israel alleged that a dozen of the agency\u2019s employees in Gaza took part in the 7 October attack. UNRWA was the \u201cbackbone of all humanitarian response in Gaza\u201d, said Guterres, adding that he had been \u201cpersonally horrified\u201d by the allegations. The Norwegian government said it would maintain its funding to UNRWA, saying it was a \u201cvital lifeline\u201d. Espen Barth Eide, Norway\u2019s foreign minister, said Oslo was standing by its \u201cstrong commitment to the agency, and to the Palestinian people\u201d. He said: \u201cWe urge fellow donor countries to reflect on the wider consequences of cutting their funding to UNRWA. UNWRA is a vital lifeline for 1.5 million refugees in Gaza. Now more than ever, the agency needs international support. To avoid collectively punishing millions of people, we need to distinguish between what individuals may have done and what UNRWA stands for.\u201d Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, said halting funding to UNRWA would entail \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d for people in Gaza. \u201cNo other entity has the capacity to deliver the scale and breadth of assistance that 2.2 million people in Gaza urgently need,\u201d he told a press conference in Geneva. He appealed for western countries to reconsider their decision to suspend funding to the agency."

This inhumane and irrational screening is deadly; thousands of trucks are blocked at the border waiting to deliver life-saving aid. The government of Israel could immediately fix this. Israel could easily drive truckloads of supplies into Gaza and instantly turn the water and electricity back on. Israel is obliged to do so under international humanitarian law. The UK voted for a UN resolution in December to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza \u2013 they must hold Israel to account to ensure that this is provided.

            "date": "2024-01-13T21:58:40Z",
            "content": "Thousands of marchers descended on Washington DC on Saturday to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and to protest US aid to Israel, more than three months into an Israeli offensive against Hamas that is killing 250 Palestinians per day, according to the Oxfam charity. The protest, called a march on Washington for Gaza, was promoted as likely to be the largest pro-Palestinian demonstration in the US since the 7 October attack on southern Israel by Hamas fighters emerging from Gaza, which killed almost 1,200 people and led to a massive military response from Israel, backed by the US government. Oxfam said the Israeli bombardment has displaced 1.8 million of the 2.3 million Palestinians living in Gaza and turned much of the besieged territory bordering Israel, the Mediterranean Sea and Egypt into rubble and dust. Saturday\u2019s protest, organized by the American Muslim Task Force for Palestine and aligned groups, was organized to draw attention to what it calls Israel\u2019s \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d and articulates a position that the creation of a fully recognized Palestinian state is in US national interests. Flyers for the event said protesters were being bused in from Florida, Minnesota, Texas, Wisconsin and other areas. A similar, British event took place in London earlier in the day, attended by thousands including the giant, well-traveled Syrian puppet Little Amal, representing refugees and displaced people, only recently back from a high-profile visit to the US-Mexico border. One of the organizing groups in Washington, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said on Friday that they had sent a letter to the White House calling on the president to secure a \u201ccomplete and verifiable ceasefire\u201d, the release of all hostages in Gaza and political prisoners in Israel, and the termination of unconditional US financial and diplomatic support for the Israeli government. The letter also called for Israeli officials to be \u201cheld accountable for the Gaza genocide\u201d, and the initiation of credible negotiations for a just and enduring peace by ending the Israeli occupation of Palestine. The rally in Washington is the second in the US capital since the current Israeli offensive began following the Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people and in which Hamas took more than 200 hostages; more than 100 are believed to still be held in Gaza. The Gaza health ministry has estimated that at least 23,708 Palestinians have been killed and 60,000 wounded in the Israeli action, the vast majority civilians. Earlier this week, South Africa accused Israel of genocide in a case brought to the International Court of Justice, charging that Israel\u2019s far-right government was \u201cintent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza\u201d and creating conditions \u201ccalculated to bring about their physical destruction\u201d. Israel has described the accusation as a \u201cblood libel\u201d and said the death toll in Gaza an unavoidable consequence of its battle against a militant army. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said it was in \u201can upside-down world\u201d that the state of Israel \u201cis accused of genocide at a time when it is fighting genocide\u201d. Among those addressing the crowd in Washington, by video link, was Al Jazeera journalist Wael al-Dahdouh, whose wife, daughter, two sons and a grandchild were killed by Israeli airstrikes. Also speaking were long-shot US presidential candidates Cornel West and Jill Stein, as well as a daughter of Malcom X, Ilyasah Shabazz. Al-Dahdouh spoke about the dire conditions Palestinians in Gaza are struggling to exist in while under Israeli bombardment. \u201cThe people are paying an exorbitant price, and are living a disastrous life,\u201d he told the crowds in Washington. \u201cPeople do not have sustenance, food or drink, a place to sleep, a bathroom and what is necessary for a life, not for a decent life, rather what is basically necessary to maintain life.\u201d Al-Dahdouh himself was injured in an Israeli airstrike that also killed his camera operator, Samer Abu Daqqa. \u201cThe whole world must look at what is happening here in the Gaza Strip,\u201d he told Al Jazeera last week. \u201cWhat is happening is a great injustice to defenseless people, civilian people.\u201d Mohamad Habehh, a director of development for American Muslims for Palestine and lead organizer of Saturday\u2019s event, told the Washington Post that organizers had picked this weekend to honor the upcoming Martin Luther King Jr Day federal holiday in the US and to mark 100 days of war by Israel in Gaza. \u201cWe\u2019re past three months of constant killing,\u201d Habehh said. \u201cWe feel that it is important for us to come on this holiday weekend in the spirit of MLK when he said that \u2018injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere\u2019, that we stand up against the injustice that\u2019s going on in Gaza right now, and stand up against the atrocities that are being supported and being promoted by our government.\u201d Speaking at the rally, Taher Herzallah, the director of outreach for American Muslims for Palestine, said the conflict in Gaza had given the people of the global south the clarity to \u201crise together in unison\u201d. \u201cWho would have known that the mighty people of Yemen would challenge the empires of the world,\u201d he added, referring to the Houthi attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea that have led to two nights of retaliatory strikes by the US and UK. A Gallup poll released last week showed that Americans are divided over US involvement in resolving the Gaza conflict, with 41% of those polled saying the US is doing \u201cabout the right amount\u201d to bring an end to the war and 39% saying it was \u201cnot enough\u201d."

            "content": "Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will not accept any ceasefire deal that requires the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners or the departure of Israeli troops from Gaza, as the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, said he was willing to travel to Cairo to discuss the proposals. Haniyeh said the group\u2019s aim remained to end Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza and secure a full pullout of Israeli forces from the territory. Although it was known Israel would struggle to accept such terms, Egypt, Qatar and the US are hoping to see if the two sides can be persuaded to accept a ceasefire lasting at least a month, which offers the chance for almost all the hostages to be released. The proposal, described as a framework, was hammered out between Egypt, Qatar, the US and Israel on Sunday during talks in Paris. The location of the talks meant Hamas negotiators could not be present. Netanyahu poured cold water on any deal that required Israeli soldiers to leave Gaza permanently without a clear military victory. He said the war in Gaza was not \u201canother round\u201d with Hamas and he would not end it without achieving Israel\u2019s goals. In regard to reports of a potential hostage deal, the Israeli PM said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would not leave Gaza, and he said he had no intention of releasing thousands of \u201cterrorists\u201d. Leaks suggest the first phase of the proposed ceasefire includes the release of about 35 hostages in return for a six-week pause of the fighting. This group would include civilian women, older men and hostages who are ill or injured. In exchange, Israel would free hundreds of Palestinians from its prisons. The second stage would be focused on male and female soldiers, and the third stage would exclusively involve the release of the bodies of dead hostages. Netanyahu is facing a deeply divided cabinet and knows the proposals could bring his government down. Speaking during a visit to an Israeli settlement in the West Bank on Tuesday, he said: \u201cWe will not compromise on anything less than total victory.\u201d He said Israel would achieve all its objectives, adding: \u201cThat means eliminating Hamas, returning all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel.\u201d Until then, no Palestinian prisoners would be freed from Israeli jails, Netanyahu said. The senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said Netanyahu\u2019s comments \u201cprove he isn\u2019t interested in the success of the Paris meeting and doesn\u2019t care about [Israeli] prisoners\u2019 lives\u201d. Israel\u2019s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, warned that a \u201cnegligent\u201d deal would lead to the dissolving of the coalition. Meanwhile, Haniyeh said: \u201cOur response to the proposal will be on the basis that the priority is stopping the aggression against Gaza and withdrawing the occupation forces from the strip. \u201cThe movement is open to discussing any serious and practical initiatives or ideas, provided that they lead to a comprehensive cessation of aggression, securing the shelter and reconstruction process, lifting the siege, and completing a serious prisoner exchange process.\u201d Precise ratios of the number of prisoners released for each category of hostage have not yet been negotiated. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said on Monday night that \u201cvery important, productive work has been done. And there is some real hope going forward.\u201d He added: \u201cHamas will have to make its own decisions. I can just tell you that there is good, strong alignment among the countries involved and that this is a good, strong proposal.\u201d David Cameron, the UK foreign secretary, has said any deal requires the removal of the Hamas military leadership from Gaza. Meanwhile, the Israeli army said on Tuesday it was channelling water into Gaza\u2019s tunnels in an attempt to destroy the sprawling underground network used by Hamas to launch attacks on Israel. There were 1,300 tunnels over 500km (310 miles) in Gaza at the start of the war in October, according to a study from the US military academy West Point. The military vowed to destroy them after Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack. In December, some Israeli media reported the military was leaning towards flooding the tunnels with seawater pumped from the Mediterranean. But experts warned the option was dangerous and posed huge risks to Gaza\u2019s besieged civilians. \u201cIt will cause severe damage to the already fragile water and sewage infrastructure that\u2019s in Gaza,\u201d the then UN humanitarian coordinator for Palestinian territories, Lynn Hastings, said in December. \u201cThere\u2019s even a risk to buildings and roads collapsing because of the increased pressure and infiltration of sea water into Gaza.\u201d On Tuesday the Israeli army said it had taken care in a way as to not \u201cdamage the area\u2019s groundwater\u201d. \u201cThe pumping of water was only carried out in tunnel routes and locations that were suitable, matching the method of operation to each case,\u201d it said. \u201cThis tool is one of a range of capabilities developed by the IDF and Israel\u2019s security establishment in recent years in order to operate against Hamas\u2019s underground infrastructure in the Gaza Strip.\u201d The Israeli army says many hostages taken by Hamas have been or continue to be held in the vast network of tunnels. The Gaza health ministry said the death toll in the territory was continuing to rise, with 26,751 Palestinians killed and 65,636 injured. Lord Cameron spoke by phone with the Jordanian foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, to discuss the ceasefire proposal. Safadi warned Cameron about the decision of the UK to suspend payments to UNRWA, the UN relief agency for Palestinians, saying it played an indispensable and irreplaceable role in helping Palestinians confront the humanitarian disaster in Gaza. The UK, in common with at least 10 other donors, has suspended funding after allegations by Israeli intelligence services that nine UNRWA employees were involved in the attacks on Israel on 7 October. The suspension is pending an inquiry being conducted by the UN. AFP contributed to this report"

He is believed to have wanted to pass down the scenes he was witnessing, despite the risk to himself. They show groups of people gathering outside a restaurant near the railway station in the Silesian city of Breslau, now Wroc\u0142aw in Poland. Jewish men, women and children of all ages were held here for a few days before deportation by train. Almost all are certain to have been killed just a few days later in a documented shooting in Lithuania. Others were killed at a later date in Poland. Steffen Heidrich, the German historian who recognised the images in a large cache of other photos, told the Observer this weekend that he hopes that any surviving friends and younger relatives may help to identify some of those pictured. Several have already been recognised. \u201cThey look quite calm. It seems clear they did not know they were about to be murdered,\u201d said Heidrich. \u201cThis was fairly early in the history of these deportations and so they obviously did not expect it.\u201d Heidrich found the previously unseen photographs in an archive in Dresden that was being catalogued by researchers. The images are being revealed for the first time now to mark today\u2019s International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the international research project #LastSeen has made them available on its website. Anyone who recognises a face in one of the scenes should contact the project by email, said Heidrich. The German research is being run by the Freie Universit\u00e4t in Berlin, which holds a library of hundreds of other photos documenting the expulsions that were carried out by the Nazis. Twelve of the Breslau photographs were taken in November 1941. An additional image was taken in April 1942. They show the deportees carrying bundles of luggage, surrounded by piles of suitcases and armed Gestapo secret police. \u201cWhen I first picked these photographs up it was an electrifying moment,\u201d Heidrich said. \u201cIt was clear they were scenes of a deportation. I Googled the name of the restaurant to confirm the location. The other photos, most of which are in a very poor condition, were of Jewish life in the DDR [the former East Germany], or of Jewish life in Dresden before the Shoah [Holocaust], so it was unexpected to find the deportation scenes there.\u201d The photographer, who is believed to be architect Albert Hadda, took his shots clandestinely through a wall or through a car window, according to Alina Bothe, director of the university project. \u201cThe accidental and sensational archival discovery opens new perspectives on the expulsion of the Jews who were persecuted in Breslau,\u201d she told Israeli newspaper Haaretz this weekend. On 21 November, 1941, more than 1,000 of Breslau\u2019s residents were arrested by the police and led to the pictured restaurant. After four days they boarded trains to Kovno, in Lithuania. On arrival they were shot to death, with no known survivors. In 1942 on 9 April, almost 1,000 Jews were once more rounded up at the same restaurant, before being transported by train to Izbica in eastern Poland. Two people on this later transport survived. Researchers believe Hadda had access to the area where the expulsions were arranged, a section of the city forbidden to the general public. From 1934, his Jewish status meant he could not work as an architect, but he avoided expulsion and death due to his marriage to a non-Jewish woman. He found part-time employment for the Jewish community in Breslau, including overseeing shipments. In 1944 Hadda was deported to a labour camp but escaped back to Breslau, where he hid until liberation. He went on to live in Frankfurt, working for Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius. He later emigrated to Israel. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 January 2024 because an earlier version said, in relation to a transport on 9 April 1942, that \u201cit is not known whether anyone survived\u201d. In fact two people survived. Also the research project was described as a German one, whereas it is international."

            "title": "Israel-Gaza war behind surge in Islamist activity, says UK counter-terror head",
            "date": "2024-01-19T19:24:37Z",
            "content": "The conflict in the Middle East has led to a surge in Islamist activity, with online terrorist propaganda rocketing and new individuals feared to have been radicalised, the head of counter-terrorism policing has said. Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Matt Jukes, who is head of the UK Counter Terrorism Policing network, said the events had led to a \u201cdangerous climate\u201d with indications of a rising threat, after Hamas\u2019s atrocity against Israel on 7 October last year led to a sustained Israeli assault on Gaza with heavy civilian casualties still continuing. British counter-terrorism officials are concerned that outrage at Israel\u2019s actions and at alleged western inaction is feeding grievances that can be exploited by Islamist propaganda, pushing people to go and stage their own attacks or support those who want to. Jukes said: \u201cThat puts us at a point in communities, on the street and online which would lead us to describe what has happened in the Middle East as a radicalisation moment. \u201cThese are the moments when a mixture of outrage, grievance and a set of enduring factors have got the potential to influence those susceptible of being pushed towards terrorism.\u201d He said that referrals to Prevent, the official scheme to stop people becoming terrorists, were up 13% between 7 October and 31 December last year compared with the same period in 2022. Jukes said the increase \u201cis directly related to the conflict in the Middle East\u201d. After the attacks, the amount of terrorist propaganda online \u2013 a key way to incite attacks and support violent extremism \u2013 surged to 15 times the level it was at beforehand, before settling at a level seven times greater. The British counter-terrorism chief said that 700 cases referred to terrorist cyber investigators had a British link and had potentially broken terrorism or other laws. Jukes said: \u201cThat is extraordinary and demonstrates the volume and intensity of online rhetoric around the ongoing conflict. \u201cWe always see spikes after terrorist incidents but what we have seen since 7 October is higher and more sustained than ever before. \u201cThis is a conflict and these are tensions playing out online in a way which, in our experience, is unprecedented.\u201d The counter-terrorism internet referral unit has had to be reinforced. Jukes said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had to put an unprecedented number of people into that work because we are looking for a needle in a haystack, and when the haystack gets 15 times bigger that poses a real challenge.\u201d Jukes said there had been a 25% increase in information flowing through police systems about terrorism and violent extremism, with useful calls coming in from the public: \u201cI would describe the speed and the scale of the impact of those global events as extraordinary.\u201d He said there had been 33 terrorism arrests in the UK since 7 October, with 19 for alleged offences at protests and 13 for alleged terrorism offences online. So far, seven people have been charged and an investigation continues into a killing to examine whether there was an extremist motive. The body that sets the UK terror threat level, the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, has so far kept it at \u201csubstantial\u201d. Jukes\u2019s comments talked to fears that the likelihood of an attack has risen, with the most likely perpetrator being a lone actor carrying out an atrocity of low sophistication, such as a knife attack. Jukes said: \u201cI have not seen the conditions collide in the way we have in the last months during my tenure.\u201d But he added that the counter-terrorism command was skilled at foiling plots \u2013 39 since 2017 \u2013 including making \u201cgoalline saves\u201d where attacks were foiled at the last moment. The war crimes unit, consisting of 20 officers, has received 92 reports of alleged offences: 19 by Hamas and 73 by Israel. British detectives have assessed them and decided that one merits being sent to the international criminal court for further investigation. Jukes also said that espionage threats from foreign states \u2013 such as China, Russia and Iran \u2013 continue to grow, with organised criminals hired to stage attacks in some cases. \u201cThat challenge is greater now than it has been since the days of the cold war,\u201d Jukes said."

            "date": "2024-01-30T17:35:58Z",
            "content": "Israeli forces dressed in doctors\u2019 scrubs and women\u2019s clothes have killed three Palestinian militants in an undercover operation in a hospital in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin. A border police counter-terrorism unit and a unit from the internal security forces, known as the Shin Bet, entered Ibn Sina hospital on the outskirts of the city\u2019s refugee camp early on Tuesday, CCTV footage of the aftermath of the operation showed. The units made their way to a room on the third floor and shot all three men in the head using pistols fitted with silencers in an attack that took less than 10 minutes from start to finish, Israeli media said. A staff member who saw the attack told the Israeli daily Haaretz that only a few of the 12 or so special forces entered the room and shot the wanted persons; the others spread out over the hospital and the main entrance to prevent any disturbance. Israel\u2019s military did not provide details on how the three were killed. Israel said the dead men were Mohammad Jalamana, a spokesperson for Hamas\u2019s military wing, Basel Ghazawi, of Islamic Jihad, and his brother Mohammed. All three were allegedly active in the umbrella force known as the Jenin Battalion, a newly formed group that has engaged Israeli forces in fierce fighting during raids in the lawless city over the past two years. The Israeli authorities said the three men had been involved in planning an attack similar to the one launched by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on 7 October that killed 1,140 people, according to Israeli data, and sparked the latest war in Gaza, which has killed 26,000 people in the strip, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-controlled territory. About 85% of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million population has been displaced from their homes in the dire humanitarian crisis. Hamas claimed Jalamana as a member, while the Palestinian Islamic Jihad said the two brothers were part of their Jenin cell. . In a statement, Hamas called the killings \u201ca vile crime that will not go without response\u201d. It said: \u201cThe resistance forces, who have sworn to fight the occupation until it is expelled, are not afraid of the assassination policy.\u201d The Palestinian health ministry condemned the attack. Hospital officials said Basel Ghawazi was being treated after being partially paralysed in an Israeli airstrike on a Jenin cemetery in November that killed four, including a 15-year-old boy. All those who died in that attack were named by Palestinian media as members of the Jenin Battalion. A hospital spokesperson, Tawfiq al-Shobaki, said there was no exchange of fire during the raid but that the Israelis attacked doctors, nurses and hospital security. In security camera footage, one of the undercover agents can be seen searching a man against a wall with his hands above his head. \u201cWhat happened is a precedent,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was never an assassination inside a hospital. There were arrests and assaults but not an assassination.\u201d Dozens of Israeli attacks on struggling hospitals in the Gaza Strip have been condemned as a breach of international humanitarian law. Israel says Hamas\u2019s use of medical facilities to hide out or launch operations makes them legitimate targets. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have found underground tunnels in the vicinity of hospitals in Gaza, although journalists and human rights organisations have been unable to verify claims that medical buildings have been used as cover for major Hamas command and control centres. Ibn Sina hospital, on the outskirts of Jenin\u2019s poverty-stricken and well-armed refugee camp, has been stormed or targeted several times by Israeli forces over the past year, including in a three-day operation last summer that at the time was the biggest IDF raid in the occupied West Bank for 20 years. Since the war in Gaza started, the West Bank and the contested city of Jerusalem have also seen a renewed wave in violence: more than 380 Palestinians have been killed, mostly in protests and army raids, and 3,000 people arrested, according to Palestinian Authority statistics. The fighting in Gaza is now entering its fifth month. Fighting and bombardment has continued to rock the coastal exclave, where Israel is now focused on the southern town of Khan Younis. A total of 128 people were killed overnight, the local health ministry said. Israeli forces are still battling Palestinian militants in sprawling Gaza City, as Hamas and the other factions active in the strip regroup in neighbourhoods that were occupied by the IDF months ago. Talks aimed at brokering a second ceasefire, led by Qatar, Egypt and the US, involve proposals for a 30-day pause in fighting and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza in return for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Progress on a deal remains elusive, according to statements on Tuesday from Israel and Hamas."

            "date": "2024-01-08T12:00:40Z",
            "content": "Maine\u2019s secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, says the threats she has faced since determining Donald Trump is disqualified from appearing on the presidential ballot in her state are an effort to scare her and others. Bellows, a first-term Democrat appointed to her position by the Maine legislature, had her home swatted after someone placed a hoax phone call claiming he had broken in. Justices on Colorado\u2019s supreme court, which also removed Trump from the ballot last month, have faced death threats. Surveys have shown there are alarmingly high levels of support for political violence in the US. \u201cEven though the swatting incident at my home was a fake call, alleging an emergency at my home, it was designed to terrorize. It was designed to make me afraid and send a message not only to me but to others,\u201d she told the Guardian in an interview. \u201cOf course I understood that there would be strong feelings and anger and opposition to my decision. I was prepared for all of that,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I wasn\u2019t prepared for was the abusive, aggressive and threatening communications, targeting not only me and also my family and those who work for me.\u201d Bellows was largely unknown outside Maine until last week when she became the first secretary of state to remove Trump from the ballot. She made that decision after three Maine voters filed a challenge under state law saying Trump was barred from running for president under section 3 of the 14th amendment. Maine law requires her to hear the challenges, and she held an hours-long public hearing on 14 December in which both the challengers and Trump\u2019s attorneys made their case. Section 3 of the 14th amendment says anyone who has taken an oath to support the constitution as a member of Congress or officer of the United States and then engages in insurrection is ineligible to hold office. The provision has been largely untested since the US civil war, but various groups have filed challenges to Trump\u2019s candidacy citing it. \u201cI am mindful that no secretary of state has ever deprived a candidate of ballot access under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment,\u201d Bellows wrote in her decision. \u201cI am also mindful, however, that no presidential candidate has ever before engaged in an insurrection.\u201d Trump has since appealed the decision to the Maine superior court, saying Bellows relied on \u201cuntrustworthy evidence\u201d and was biased against him. He is also appealing the Colorado decision to the US supreme court. Bellows served as a presidential elector for Joe Biden in 2020 and called January 6 an insurrection as early as 2021. Bellows noted in her decision that she would be able to evaluate the issue without bias. \u201cMy decision was based exclusively on the record of facts represented at the hearing, the legal arguments and the United States constitution,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was my only and sole consideration because that\u2019s the oath I swore to the constitution, is to uphold my duty under Maine\u2019s election laws and to follow the law. And that\u2019s what the law required.\u201d"

            "content": "A teenager who wanted \u201cto bring about the downfall of government and society\u201d has gone on trial accused of planning a suicide terrorist attack to kill \u201cat least 50\u201d people. Jacob Graham, 19, a Unabomber obsessive from Norris Green in Liverpool, stockpiled ingredients to make bombs, carried out chemical experiments and bought a 3D printer to make his own gun, Manchester crown court heard. He recorded a video of himself boasting he had \u201ceverything I need to take down a fucking army\u201d and \u201ceverything I need, material-wise, to start my revolution\u201d, the court was told. The college student made 105 videos outlining his planning and motivations and wrote a \u201cmanifesto\u201d titled \u201csociety and why it is failing\u201d, as well as a letter setting out his intentions, the jury heard. He also wrote a manual called the \u201cfreedom encyclopaedia\u201d that he called his \u201ccookbook\u201d, the court was told. This contained recipes for homemade explosives, with the intention, the prosecution said, of assisting others to commit their own acts of terrorism. He had also packaged chemicals up and gone to woods in Formby, on the Merseyside coast, and buried them in a secret hide, the court heard. Graham, who denies carrying out eight terrorism offences between May 2022 and May 2023, said he didn\u2019t have a date or set target for an attack but that he was \u201caiming for at least 50 deceased and more injured. Any more is a blessing\u201d. He suggested he could attack \u201cgovernment buildings, politicians\u2019 houses\u201d and would commit mass murder on \u201cthose who think it is OK to hide their wrongdoings behind money and power\u201d, the jury was told. He also had a grievance against Hugh Baird College in Bootle, Liverpool, where he was a student, the court heard. He said he was \u201ca firm believer in an eye for an eye\u201d and that the college had wronged him. Opening the case on Thursday, the prosecutor, Annabel Darlow KC, told the jury that Graham \u201creferred to his plan as a \u2018terrorist\u2019 plan and suggested that terrorism was standing up for what he believed was right and hitting back at a system that has done nothing but \u2018degrade the working-class people of this country\u2019. He said it was his responsibility to fix the problem.\u201d She added: \u201cWhat he wanted to do was attack and bring about the downfall of government and society. He was against the concept of government. He said that he was sick and tired of living in a society that was deteriorating and destroying itself. His grievances were motivated both by hatred of the government and by ecological concerns.\u201d The jury watched a video recorded on 9 August 2022 of pink-cheeked and bespectacled Graham delivering a speech to his webcam in his bedroom, with what looked like soft toys visible on his pillow. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to do it I\u2019ve got to do it with a bang, no pun intended. It needs to be big,\u201d he said. In a video recorded on 3 May 2022, Graham spoke of going on a rampage, stating he would kill himself afterwards. \u201cHe then talked about normal people suffering whilst scroungers migrate everywhere and get the good life,\u201d Darlow said. The jury heard that Graham\u2019s \u201cidol\u201d was Theodore John Kaczynski, better known as the Unabomber, a US terrorist who carried out a deadly mail bomb campaign. Graham\u2019s manifesto quoted Kaczynski as saying \u201cthe Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race\u201d and suggested that society was failing and was destined to collapse, Darlow told the jury. The trial continues."

            "content": "Nicola Sturgeon has been accused of \u201ca shocking betrayal of the people of Scotland\u201d as it emerged that the former first minister, along with other senior ministers and health officials, deleted all their WhatsApp messages related to the Covid pandemic. The UK Covid Inquiry, taking evidence in Scotland, heard on Friday that Sturgeon \u201cretained no messages whatsoever\u201d while the national clinical director, Jason Leith, joked in a group chat that WhatsApp deletion was his \u201cpre-bed ritual\u201d. Sturgeon had previously refused to confirm or deny allegations that she deleted the messages but insisted she was committed to \u201cfull transparency\u201d about her conduct during the pandemic, adding: \u201cI have nothing to hide.\u201d At the hearing in Edinburgh, Lesley Fraser, the director general corporate of the Scottish government, was questioned about details supplied by the Scottish government summarising ministers\u2019 retention of messages and other forms of communication. Counsel to the inquiry Jamie Dawson KC said: \u201cUnder the box \u2018Nicola Sturgeon\u2019, it says that messages were not retained, they were deleted in routine tidying up of inboxes or changes of phones, unable to retrieve messages. \u201cWhat that tends to suggest is at the time that request was made Nicola Sturgeon, the former first minister of Scotland, had retained no messages whatsoever in connection with her management of the pandemic.\u201d Fraser responded: \u201cThat\u2019s what that indicates to me.\u201d She went on to say that Sturgeon would have worked with her private office and those instructions would be retained. The documents also set out that messages sent by the former deputy first minister John Swinney were either manually deleted or he had used WhatsApp\u2019s auto-delete function. This is the first official confirmation that Sturgeon did not keep any of her pandemic messages and contradicts the commitment she made in August 2021 when she announced there would be a Scottish Covid inquiry and pledged to disclose her private messages in evidence. Asked by Dawson if the Scottish government\u2019s record retention policies \u201cwere simply not fit for purpose\u201d during the pandemic, Fraser said she did not accept this but understood the \u201churt and frustration\u201d caused. Aamer Anwar, the lawyer representing Covid bereaved families in Scotland, said the deletion of messages \u201ccan only be described as a cynical and pre-meditated decision\u201d and that Sturgeon and others \u201cmust answer as to their motivation\u201d. He added that timing of deletion was crucial: \u201cIf auto-delete or manual deletion pre-existed the announcement of the public inquiry in August 2021, why was an order not then issued to stop any further deletion of WhatsApps?\u201d Anwar continued: \u201cSturgeon should be treated no differently to Boris Johnson, who failed to provide WhatsApps from the start of the pandemic, while the prime minister Rishi Sunak claims to have none at all.\u201d Also giving evidence, Ken Thomson, the former manager of the Covid coordination directorate of the Scottish government, said Sturgeon \u201cdid not take a decision in informal messaging\u201d and that it was \u201crare\u201d that she would message him at all. There has been a furious response across the political spectrum to the evidence. The Scottish Labour deputy, Jackie Baille, described the news as \u201ca shocking betrayal of the people of Scotland\u201d, while the Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, said Sturgeon and Swinney \u201chave huge questions to answer over their conduct in the wake of this devastating revelation\u201d."

            "title": "Day by Michael Cunningham review \u2013 living through the pandemic",
            "date": "2024-01-25T07:30:15Z",
            "content": "The day of the title is a composite of three days: a morning in 2019, a locked-down afternoon in 2020, and an evening in 2021, when it is possible to travel and gather again. On 5 April in each of these years, Michael Cunningham takes his samplings, or specimen hours, minutely observing the lives of the people he finds in a Brooklyn apartment. A quarter century after The Hours, with its three Mrs Dalloways in different times and cities, Cunningham returns to a solidly tripartite structure across which contrasts and connections build. And he returns, with undiminished faith, to the project that united modernists as different as his heroes Joyce and Woolf: the effort to articulate the vast inner lives of a few unexceptional people on a single day. Before, during, after: that\u2019s the basic movement, though \u201cbefore\u201d is suffused by a sense of lateness as a couple drift in their marriage, trying to recapture youth. Dan and Isabel, reaching middle age, have changed to accommodate each other, changed with parenthood, and they\u2019re not the couple who fell in love. Isabel is yearning to get out long before the virus shuts her in. Scanning departure boards, \u201cthinking of the women who abandon everything\u201d, she is kin with Laura Brown, the quietly desperate woman in The Hours who cannot go on making perfect birthday cakes. For the moment, Isabel sits on the stairs, \u201cparalysed by her own triviality\u201d, and imagines never moving; future residents of the apartment will have to edge past the blockage. Around her, the novel\u2019s mid-life characters scrutinise their feelings, wondering where they\u2019ve failed, monitoring their emotional effect on each other so continually that there is little opportunity to concentrate on anything else. By the time six-year-old Violet pleads with her family to close the windows, fraught with fear for those she loves, Day has already evoked many kinds of airlessness. Everyone, including the reader, wants the company of Isabel\u2019s younger brother, who has the gift of lifting the inertia and making joy with whatever materials he finds. Isabel and Dan both feel themselves more \u201cin love\u201d with Robbie than with each other, and we get portraits of two further partnerships: one between ardently, indefinably devoted brothers-in-law (this is territory Cunningham explored in 2010\u2019s By Nightfall), and one between siblings. In this, his eighth novel, Cunningham renews his long commitment to writing about intimate, domestic love of many kinds: straight, gay, motherly, brotherly and avuncular love, and the love between old friends, to name a few, though the writing works against discrete categorisations. A heterosexual couple with children is one model of family among many others. None is more heroic or erotic or inherently complex than the others. And so, broadening the panorama of emotional attachments in a few square feet of Brooklyn, in comes the woman who has had a baby with sperm donated by Dan\u2019s brother \u2013 and then here\u2019s the brother, too. Variously separating people or trapping them together, the events of 2020 put their shifting relationships under pressure. By the end of the novel each has been reconfigured, though they will go on changing. This is not the first time Cunningham has written about an epidemic. In The Hours he gave the shell-shocked soldier of Mrs Dalloway a modern counterpart in the figure of a poet dying of Aids. It was a daring move and he managed it without flattening or conflating the different tragedies involved. In seeking a form for his novel of the Covid years, he has again made himself Woolf\u2019s student (with George Eliot prominent on the reading list as well). The outlines of To the Lighthouse keep becoming visible: the three-part shape Woolf found for the story of a family before and after a period of dispersal, darkness and loss. Cunningham measures his material against hers. We might have done without the elegiac scene in an empty house, where a rock band T-shirt hangs on the hook in memory of Mrs Ramsay\u2019s cloak. But the reassembly of the family around a central absence is powerfully rendered: this third section has a contemporary and idiosyncratic life of its own while catching echoes of other times and other survivors. Day is written with caressing attention to its characters, a kind of long massage that seeks out tiny subcutaneous knots. Only a lover would keep telling us that Dan \u2013 beautiful specimen of ordinary, ageing man \u2013 is one of the missing figures in art, unappreciated by the Greeks and everyone after. Anything too minor for comment in life receives its due here. Every shade of emotion is registered. Such vigilance gives rise to one of the novel\u2019s most intriguing dynamics. It replicates the overanalysed relationships that the women, at least, need a rest from. They are tired of being so tenderly read. The liveliest and most memorable portrait is of the little girl, Violet, already a shrewd performer in every moment, dutifully pre-empting the responses of her devoted but exhausted audience. Reading Violet, we might remember the visionary child Lucas in Cunningham\u2019s wilder, weirder 2005 novel Specimen Days. No one had time to understand Lucas as he fed himself into the giant machine of the Industrial Revolution and emerged maimed. Now here is Violet, twirling in her dress, abundantly cared for. Cunningham allows her to be sad, nonetheless, to feel the weight of a difficult world on her shoulders, and occasionally to turn away from human feelings to animals and stars. There\u2019s a loving kind of licence in that. \u2022 Day by Michael Cunningham is published by HarperCollins (\u00a316.99).

            "date": "2024-01-22T17:30:33Z",
            "content": "Whether it is jumping up at strangers, tugging on a lead or disappearing into the distance, the UK\u2019s pandemic puppies are still in the doghouse, a survey has revealed. Research by the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) has added to growing concerns that many owners who acquired a puppy during the height of the Covid pandemic were struggling with their dogs\u2019 behaviour as they reached 21 months. Among other findings, a fifth of owners surveyed reported their dog had eight or more problem behaviours at that age, such as pulling on the lead, clinginess or aggression, while 33% of owners found training their dog harder than expected \u2013 something that was more common among first-time owners. Dr Rowena Packer, a lecturer in companion animal behaviour and welfare science at the RVC, and lead author of the study, said a key problem was that many people did not do enough research, and were unaware of the level of responsibility involved in training their dog. She said: \u201cI think a lot of new owners go in with very high hopes [of] their dog\u2019s behaviour and then when they realise actually training is quite tough, that\u2019s where a third of them were really struggling.\u201d Another problem, said Packer, was the trend to project human thoughts and feelings on to dogs \u2013 for example labelling certain behaviours as naughty. \u201cDogs don\u2019t come off the shelf ready to know how to spend a day walking around on a lead meeting other dogs, going into social spaces with other people \u2013 all these things need to be taught,\u201d she said. However, not all struggling owners are inexperienced. Phil Wright, 59, from Southport, owned a number of labradors before he welcomed sisters Scout and Harper into his home as puppies in February 2020. He said: \u201cI didn\u2019t anticipate any problems. But I didn\u2019t anticipate lockdown either.\u201d Both his black labradors have severe separation anxiety, with Scout howling if Wright leaves the house, as well as problematic behaviour on the lead such as barking \u2013 particularly if they see a small dog. \u201cThey can pull me over,\u201d said Wright. \u201cThe separation anxiety definitely stems from me being around so much during lockdown. Likewise the behaviour on lead [is] due to lack of socialisation during lockdown,\u201d he added. According to UK Pet Food, in 2023 there were about 12 million pet dogs in the UK, with some data suggesting there was a surge in puppy ownership during the height of the Covid pandemic. However, the RVC survey reveals Wright is not alone in facing difficulties. Out of more than 1,000 UK dog owners, 97% reported their dog had at least one problem behaviour from a list of 24, while on average owners reported five problems. The most common problem was pulling on the lead \u2013 reported by about two-thirds of participants \u2013 with jumping up and poor recall in second and third place respectively. Overall, control problems were the most common type of trouble \u2013 being reported by 84% of participants \u2013 however 25% reported their dog had aggressive behaviours. The latest results are part of a project by the RVC that follows a group of dogs bought as young puppies in 2020, during the Covid pandemic. While the study was not able to compare the prevalence of problem behaviours among pandemic puppies with their prevalence among dogs acquired before or after the pandemic, Packer said comparisons with other datasets suggested a general elevation of issues among the pandemic puppy cohort. The team added one area of concern was that, while 96% of owners used positive reinforcement such as praise to train their dog, 82% used one or more punishment-based methods such as choke chains, shouting or pushing their dog \u2013 methods that can cause further behavioural problems. Such approaches, they note, appeared to be more common in owners who had not attended online puppy classes during the pandemic. Packer added owners reported turning to friends, family or even social media for advice on dog training, but that many of the latter advocated punishment-based techniques. \u201cThese owners are struggling but they\u2019re not actually reaching out to professionals for help,\u201d she said. The RVC advises those who are struggling with behaviour problems in their dog to take their pet to the vet, as difficulties can cause health problems, while those who missed out on puppy classes can still get help with behaviour from experts registered with the Animal Behaviour Training Council. Wright added that despite the challenges, he would not be without his dogs. \u201cThey are great, beautiful, friendly, but just a nightmare when they are out on a lead,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2024-01-20T18:42:07Z",
            "content": "Nicola Sturgeon has said the UK Covid inquiry \u201cdoes have messages\u201d between her and those she communicated with during the pandemic, after it emerged they had been deleted from her device. The former first minister of Scotland posted on X that she will \u201canswer questions directly and openly\u201d when she gives evidence to the inquiry at the end of January. It comes after the inquiry, taking evidence in Scotland, heard on Friday that all WhatsApp messages sent and received by Sturgeon during the pandemic were erased. Sturgeon said: \u201cContrary to the impression given in some coverage, the inquiry does have messages between me and those I most regularly communicated with through informal means. \u201cAlthough these had not been retained on my own device, I was able to obtain copies which I submitted to the inquiry last year.\u201d Sturgeon said that Scotland\u2019s Covid response was conducted through \u201cformal processes\u201d and not through WhatsApp or any other informal platform. \u201cThe number of people I communicated with through informal messaging at all was limited,\u201d Sturgeon added. Moreover, she said, any handwritten notes she made were passed to her private office to be \u201cdealt with and recorded as appropriate\u201d. She accepted she did not get every decision right during the pandemic but said her motivation throughout was to \u201ckeep people as safe as possible\u201d."
