            "content": "If elected, Donald Trump plans to carry out \u201cthe largest deportation operation in American history\u201d. After pushback on Joe Biden\u2019s border policies, Kamala Harris has embraced border restrictions and the need to maintain limits on asylum seekers. But neither candidate captures the realities of US immigration. US consumers are accustomed to cheap goods and services, and the economic rationale for large-scale immigration has been largely avoided. In a country that relies on a mobile, low-cost workforce, the loss of migrant workers would trigger productivity losses and a new round of inflationary pricing pressure. \u201cIt would be an economic disaster for America and Americans,\u201d says Zeke Hernandez, an economics professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, of Trump\u2019s deportations threat. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the immigrants would be harmed, but we, the people of America, would be economically harmed.\u201d Baby boomers are retiring, and with fewer immigrants, the workforce will struggle to sustain economic output: US employers will need to hire 240,000 people a month for the next five years just to replace those who are stepping out, according to one recent study. Hernandez, author of a recent book, The Truth About Immigration, argues that immigrants contribute talent, investment, innovation, consumption and tax revenue. \u201cIf you lose those things, there are fewer jobs, the economy contracts and becomes less diversified.\u201d Of the undocumented migrants, between 8 and 9 million are in the workforce doing essential jobs that Americans disproportionately don\u2019t want to do or work in sectors where there aren\u2019t enough workers. Typically, that\u2019s farm work (one third of the labor force), construction work (about one quarter) and about half of the labor force in skilled work like drywalling, plumbing and insulation. \u201cUndocumented immigrants make up a huge proportion of household services, manufacturing work, kitchen staff in restaurants. Americans simply do not do those jobs, or there are not enough to go around. But if you lose those key \u2018bottleneck\u2019 workers, the native workforce also can\u2019t do their jobs,\u201d says Hernandez. A study by the Center for Migration Studies estimates undocumented workers contribute $97bn in federal, state and local taxes, their removal from the workforce would have a substantial impact on local economies, including pushing nearly 10 million US citizens into economic hardship. Families would also be profoundly impacted. About 5.8m US households are home to at least one undocumented resident and mass deportations would break up nearly 5m US families. The cost of bringing up US-born children whose caregivers are removed has been put at $116bn. Taxpayers would have to foot the bill. Apprehending and deporting just 1 million of an estimated 11 million-12 million undocumented migrants in the US could cost taxpayers about $20bn, or $19,599 per person, according to a CBS News analysis of federal data \u2013 and take far longer than the term of a four-year Trump administration. Business leaders have been fairly quiet on Trump\u2019s plans \u2013 possibly fearing retribution \u2013 but some lobby groups have begun to tally the costs of mass deportation. The construction sector employs an estimated 1.5 million undocumented workers, or 13% of its total workforce \u2013 a larger share than any other, according to data the Pew Research Center. Construction firms, already facing labor shortages, are warning that the loss of immigrant workers would push new home prices higher. The National Association of Home Builders considers foreign-born workers, regardless of legal status, \u201ca vital and flexible source of labor\u201d. The CEO of the NAHB, Jim Tobin, told NBC that their loss would be \u201cdetrimental to the construction industry and our labor supply and exacerbate our housing affordability problems\u201d. The Business Roundtable notes that \u201cimmigrants have always been a key part of America\u2019s innovative spirit. A vast majority of economists and business leaders agree that immigration is a net positive for the US economy\u201d but says \u201cthe system for welcoming these highly valuable workers is broken\u201d. A 2023 study of previous efforts at mass deportation, such as President Barack Obama\u2019s Secure Communities program from 2008 to 2014 that resulted in the deportation of almost half a million people, found that any benefits from reduced job competition that US-born workers face were counteracted by a decline in labor demand due to an increase in labor costs. \u201cPolice-based enforcement policies aimed at reducing the number of undocumented immigrants should consider the potential negative spillover effects on the labor market outcomes of immigrants who remain in the US and on US-born workers,\u201d a University of Denver study concluded. The same effect was seen during the Trump and Biden administrations when the Covid pandemic caused about a million fewer immigrants to enter the US leading to labor shortages and reduced output, and contributing to inflationary pressure. The post-pandemic spike in immigration contributed to inflation coming down, according to Hernandez. \u201cImmigration allowed business to hire again and raise output to what the market demands, so prices normalized,\u201d he says. Nevertheless opponents of immigration have been \u201cvery effective at flooding the zone with false or dubious claims\u201d, said Hernandez. Biden\u2019s policies, which Harris is now walking back, have created complications for the Latino communities in the US, resulting in declining support for Democrats and a frantic late-campaign effort to shore up their votes. In 2012, Latino support for Obama was at 71%. Eight years later Biden won 62%. A recent Times/Siena poll found Harris with 56%. According to Ana Valdez, president and CEO of the Latino Donor Collaborative, says the negative myths around Latino immigration are just \u201cpure rhetoric \u2026 Trump knows that most of the workforce the US needs to continue growing comes from Latinos.\u201d Valdez cites labor department statistics that show Latino workers in the labor force have grown from 10.7 million in 1990 to 29 million in 2020, and are projected to reach 36 million in 2030. In 2030, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects they will account for one out of every five workers in the labor force, at 21.2%, or or 78% of net new workers by 2030. Without those immigrant workers, the change in the standard of living for the middle class would be much more dramatic, Valdez says. \u201cThe reason we have avocados or chicken to choose from every day is because of immigration.\u201d Valdez, who worked in the Clinton administration, cites figure that show US Latinos generate $3.6tn in GDP and says the political discourse around the issue by both parties has equated all Latinos to undocumented immigrants and does not reflect the economic, data-backed reality. \u201cIf Trump and Harris want to win the Latino vote, and if the winner wants to keep our support once they\u2019re in office, they need to change their perspective and messaging to Latinos and recognize the full scope of our economic contributions,\u201d she says. \u201cNot doing so is reckless for their campaigns and the US economy.\u201d"

            "title": "Biden\u2019s economic legacy could decide the presidential race in Scranton",
            "date": "2024-10-20T10:00:41Z",
            "content": "From the north, motorists pull into Scranton via the Joseph R Biden Jr Expressway. Cutting through the scenic Pocono Mountains, now at the start of autumn color season, they are greeted with a towering, electric billboard, blaring an encapsulating \u2013 if divisive \u2013 message to this working-class town: \u201cDemocrats for Trump,\u201d it reads. \u201cEconomy,\u201d it continues, with a green checked box next to the word. The sign in Biden\u2019s hometown is the perfect fall 2024 welcome mat in this crucial swing state filled with voters whose economic anxiety or satisfaction will decide next month\u2019s election. The US has staged a remarkable recovery since the pandemic and Biden has successfully pursued an economic agenda, Bidenomics, that should benefit Scranton and the state \u2013 $13bn has been earmarked from his infrastructure bill for repairing highways and bridges alone. But poll after poll shows deep-seated worries about the economy \u2013 worries that could sink Democrats\u2019 chances of keeping the White House come November. Like many mid-sized upper midwest cities that have faced post-industrial decline, Scranton, a longtime Democratic stronghold, has grown more conservative in recent elections. With the city\u2019s native son leaving office, and pocketbook issues top of mind, some believe Trump could finally take Scranton \u2013 a more-than-symbolic win. But with Kamala Harris, Biden\u2019s successor, and Donald Trump tied in the polls, guessing who will take Scranton, Pennsylvania, and the White House is a fool\u2019s errand. And this politically split town shows why the race is so close. On the street, one person\u2019s economic reality may be entirely different to the next. The complicated political mix of fears about the local economy, faith and mistrust in both Harris and Trump and shifting political allegiance was evident at the Marketplace at Steamtown, a downtown mall filled with local mom-and-pop shops. Pete, 78, a swing voter who declined to provide his last name, said inflation had been a problem over the last four years, but added prices were coming down, the stock market was high, and said he didn\u2019t blame Biden for the economic challenges. \u201cEvery president is stuck with what happened before, and the pandemic happened, so Biden was in a hole to begin with,\u201d Pete said. But the veteran added the main issue driving him to Harris was Trump disrespecting veterans: \u201cHe called us suckers and losers.\u201d The argument for Trump\u2019s economics is ironclad, said Lori Higgins with a scoff: \u201cLook at the last four years \u2013 everyone is paying more for everything. What more do you need to know to make a decision?\u201d Now 52, she voted for Democrats until Trump convinced her to switch sides in 2016. Even on the most basic details, there is disagreement: Pete said he had just paid $2.99 for gas, citing it as evidence that inflation was coming under control. Two Trump supporters said they paid as much as $3.50 for gas, evidence, they said, that inflation is still squeezing Scranton. Trump and Harris have made close to 50 visits to Pennsylvania so far this election cycle and poured nearly $1bn into ads \u2013 a record spend that reflects how crucial its 19 electoral votes, the biggest prize of any battleground, make the keystone state. Trump made his second visit to Scranton in as many months last week. \u201cGo get everyone you know and vote immediately,\u201d he urged rallygoers. But persuading any part of the deeply divided electorate to swap their vote looks difficult. Harris may yet hold Scranton, said Berwood Yost, a Pennsylvania pollster, but that is \u201csurprising\u201d given the level of economic discontent in the city and the county. \u201cThe dissatisfaction with Biden is really high and views on personal finances are very negative, so Trump should be clearly ahead,\u201d Yost said. And yet polling averages show Harris ahead by a point in Pennsylvania, (firmly within the margin of error) which \u201cspeaks in part to some voters\u2019 concerns about Trump and his personal character\u201d. Since 2000, Democrats have won the county with as much as 63% support, but Hillary Clinton narrowly won with less than 50% of the 2016 vote. Biden\u2019s home-field advantage may have buoyed Dems in 2020 \u2013 he was born and raised in Scranton until the age of 10, when his family moved to Delaware, and he has name-checked the city throughout his long career and is still nicknamed \u201cPennsylvania\u2019s third senator\u201d. Biden beat Trump in the county by 53.7% to 45.3%. Still, Scranton has become \u201cground zero for demonstrating the appeal of Trump and the Maga movement, and places that traditionally voted Democrat and ended up changing their stripes in a significant way\u201d, Yost said. \u2018Way more optimistic\u2019 Once a powerhouse city in the nation\u2019s coal capital, Scranton\u2019s economy is now driven by small business, retail, healthcare, education and the service sector, said Satyajit Ghosh, a University of Scranton economist. Though there is no shortage of empty storefronts downtown, it is noticeably livelier than many similar Rust belt urban cores. University of Scranton\u2019s surveys of downtown businesses found owners in April had concerns about the current economic climate but were decidedly more optimistic about the next six months: \u201cWay more optimistic than they were a year ago,\u201d Ghosh said. Yost\u2019s most recent polling put Harris up three points statewide and found the economy to be the top issue for 34% of residents. Other recent polling found 60% of Pennsylvanians said their economic situation was worse compared with 40% who say it was better or no different. James Simrell is part of the latter group. As he closed up his boxing gym in Steamtown, the lifelong Democrat was upbeat about Scranton\u2019s economy. His gym is just one of his three businesses, and all stay busy \u2013 he also designs jewelry and runs a small farm that produces butternut squash and pumpkins. He sells pumpkins to Blackwatch Cafe, and squash to Abe\u2019s Delicatessen, which uses it in their soup. \u201cEveryone is doing well,\u201d Simrell said. In contrast, the Trump economy was \u201cfalling apart\u201d as the former president left office amid a poorly managed pandemic, Simrell said. He has other reasons for not voting for Trump. His two adopted children are Black and Trump is \u201ca little bit prejudiced \u2013 it drives my wife crazy\u201d. Echoing longtime Democratic voters\u2019 sentiment, he added: \u201cMy mom and dad were Democrats and I follow what they believe, and Kamala\u2019s the best person to be president \u2013 she\u2019s not crazy.\u201d But lingering inflation is still a drag for Eric Flesher, who runs a collectibles and vintage store, Rock-N-Models. He likened the economy to a \u201ctightening sphincter\u201d. He declined to talk about politics, but said everything remained expensive: \u201cI\u2019m in a business that sells stuff that nobody needs unless they have disposable income, so it gets much more difficult\u201d when there is inflation, Flesher said. Flesher added that he disagreed with the \u201cmindset here that I should vote for someone because that\u2019s how my mom and dad voted \u2013 then you\u2019re just voting for a party and not a person\u201d, he added. \u2018She\u2019s not the kind you can trust\u2019 The economic indicators in Scranton track those of the wider US. Inflation, which peaked at an annual rate of 9.1% in mid-2022, has eased to 2.4%. Prices are similarly down in Scranton, the economist Ghosh said. Seasonally adjusted unemployment in the region was 3.9% in August, below the 4.2% national average. \u201cIn this area, which I\u2019ve covered for many years, I really haven\u2019t ever seen this strong of a performance in terms of employment,\u201d said Ghosh. Still, there\u2019s an after-effect of inflation that consumers feel, Ghosh added, and some high prices, like those for rent or food, are still hurting. Outside a Walmart in Dickson City, a retail hub just north of Scranton, husband and wife John and Carol Gardner still feel the pinch. The Mount Cobb residents used to pay $150-$200 a month on groceries, and now they pay twice that. Carol is out of a job on disability, while John assembles buffet trays for $12 an hour to make ends meet, even though he said he should be retired. \u201cTrump at least made sure we could go shopping, and Biden is making sure we can\u2019t,\u201d Carol said. \u201cI hope the lady doesn\u2019t get in because we\u2019re going to go straight downhill \u2013 she\u2019s not the kind you can trust.\u201d The view is different at Bethel AME, a 153-year old Black church on downtown\u2019s west side. Pastor Mark Alexander sees an improving economy, and blames inflation on Trump. \u201cInflation was more so because of Covid, and how the former president handled that situation, because when you have supply chain interruptions and poor leadership guiding the nation, it exacerbates things,\u201d he said. The Federal Reserve, not the president, decides rates, Alexander noted, and he pointed to low unemployment, the Chips Act \u2013 which is pouring billions into domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductors \u2013 and Biden\u2019s infrastructure bill as evidence of the president\u2019s economic success. Moreover, at Bethel AME, there is \u201cexcitement for someone who looks like us and has experienced some of things we have gone through and comes from a middle-class upbringing\u201d, Alexander added. \u201cAs opposed to a billionaire who has no clue what it is like day to day for middle-class people,\u201d he said. That\u2019s especially true with younger people because Harris \u201cspeaks their language\u201d, Alexander added. For others, neither candidate is appealing. Mike Gilson owns a flooring business, a maintenance company, and manages artists and chefs. He said the economy was strong locally because its economic backbone was made up of longtime small businesses, and it fared better during the last session than most other areas because of that composition. But the city\u2019s relatively strong economic standing is not persuading Gilson to vote for Harris. He said the president was a \u201cceremonial position\u201d and big corporations run the nation. \u201cIf the president actually wielded the power that people think they do then voting would make a lot more sense to me,\u201d Gilson said. History will decide which of Scranton\u2019s many voices will decide this election. Right now it is unclear whether the legacy of the city\u2019s most famous son will be enough to carry Harris over the line or finally hand Scranton and the state to Trump. With the race essentially a toss-up at this point, the key for either party is going to be turnout, Yost said. But in that battle, Trump may have an advantage \u2013 people who are less likely to vote have in recent elections voted for Trump. \u201cDemocrats have to counter that by getting their voters to the polls,\u201d Yost said. \u201cThink about the election as a mosaic \u2013 there are many pieces and some are bigger than others, but they\u2019re all going to matter.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-26T19:03:28Z",
            "content": "Labour will launch a new era of public and private investment in hospitals, schools, transport and energy as momentous as any in the party\u2019s history in this week\u2019s budget, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said. In an interview with the Observer before the first budget by a female chancellor, Reeves draws comparisons with Labour\u2019s historic reform programmes begun in 1945 by Clement Attlee, in 1964 under Harold Wilson and in 1997 under Tony Blair. \u201cThis is only the fourth time that Labour has gone from opposition into government,\u201d she says. \u201cIn 1945, we rebuilt after the war; in 1964, we rebuilt with the \u2018white heat of technology\u2019; and in 1997, we rebuilt our public services. We need to do all of that now.\u201d Reeves will, however, face huge controversy amid claims that she will break at least the spirit of Labour\u2019s election promises when she announces \u00a340bn of tax rises and spending cuts that will include an increase of up to 2% in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) and a likely further freeze in income tax thresholds beyond 2028. Such a freeze on thresholds \u2013 which Reeves described last year as \u201cpicking the pockets of working people\u201d when the same policy was reannounced by the Tories \u2013 will drag 400,000 people into paying tax for the first time and 600,000 into doing so at a higher rate. Before the election, Labour ruled out any increases in income tax, national insurance and VAT on \u201cworking people\u201d. In the interview, Reeves claims that she is in fact keeping to her election pledges in full, as people will not see their taxes rise immediately after the budget and national insurance rises will not directly affect employees. \u201cThe day after the budget, people are not going to see those main taxes that they pay \u2013 income tax, national insurance, VAT \u2013 going up \u2026 We promised at the election that we wouldn\u2019t put up those taxes for working people. \u201cOne of the things that has eroded trust in politics and politicians has been a failure to stick to manifesto commitments. We don\u2019t want to be that sort of government, I don\u2019t want to be that sort of chancellor.\u201d But Jeremy Hunt, the shadow chancellor, said that raising employer NICs was a \u201cjobs tax that is paid by working people\u201d, which would mean \u201cfewer jobs and lower wages\u201d, as employers would pass on the effects to those they employed in the form of lower wages or redundancies. He cited the Institute for Fiscal Studies as saying the rise would be a \u201cstraightforward breach\u201d of promises. While she is bound to face a backlashes over tax rises, Reeves is determined to portray the budget as the launch of a period of huge \u201cnational renewal\u201d that will tackle the legacy of chaos left by the Tories \u2013 a \u00a322bn black hole in current spending \u2013 through tough decisions on tax, while changing the fiscal rules to allow \u00a350bn of extra borrowing for capital projects to reverse a decline in infrastructure across the public sphere. As part of the twin-track approach, \u00a31.4bn will be directed towards \u201crebuilding crumbling schools\u201d, with 50 schools rebuilt a year. Hospital rebuilding projects are expected to be announced alongside these in the budget. Reeves says such schemes would not be possible without changing the fiscal rules, and makes clear she expects the Tories to oppose such changes in the aftermath of the budget. Sensing the opportunity to open a new dividing line with the Conservatives, Reeves says: \u201cIf they oppose our new fiscal rules next week, they will basically be saying they support the current path of decline. We are happy to have that debate. We are on the right side of it.\u201d She adds: \u201cI think the big divide in politics after this is going to be whether you are in favour of investment or whether you are in favour of decline. \u201cWe inherited a plan from the previous government in which public sector net investment, capital investment, would be falling sharply over the course of this parliament, and that would mean scores of hospitals not built. It would mean massive opportunities to grow our economy in the digital and energy sector would be missed and those jobs would go elsewhere.\u201d She spells out how she sees two types of investment as crucial to transforming the country, as a direct result of reforming borrowing rules. The first will be projects that \u201ccrowd in\u201d big private sector investment alongside public funding, such as the plan recently announced for \u00a321bn of public investment in carbon capture and storage alongside billions of pounds of private investment. There will be other such public-private models in the energy, digital, science and transport sectors, to be announced in the budget. The second type of investment will be in \u201cthe public realm\u201d, with the rebuilding of urgently needed schools and hospital buildings. New and developing industries also offer huge opportunities that invite investment, she says. \u201cThis is a new settlement on Wednesday to rebuild our country and seize the massive opportunities in technology and energy that are out there. There is a global race on for those jobs and we need to seize them for Britain. If we can unlock that investment, public and private, then we can do great things as a country again.\u201d Reeves says that while she will not be lifting the two-child benefit cap that is blamed for plunging thousands more young people into poverty, she will be taking other actions to alleviate child poverty. \u201cWe are a good Labour government, and good Labour governments lift children out of poverty and fix the National Health Service. I hope that people can see that I am starting to turn the corner.\u201d"

            "title": "Harris edges out Trump on key economic questions, new poll shows",
            "date": "2024-10-21T15:24:29Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump has lost his advantage over Kamala Harris on who is best qualified to manage the economy, new polls suggest. With millions of voters already casting early ballots for the presidency ahead of election day on 5 November, a fresh Associated Press/NORC poll says Harris, the Democratic nominee, has taken a slight lead when it comes to some key economic questions that concern middle-class voters. The finding consolidates a trend from the the same poll last month, which showed Harris had almost closed a previously large deficit with Trump, the former US president and Republican nominee, on who could best handle economic issues. The economy consistently tops voters\u2019 priority list. The latest poll asked more detailed questions than the previous survey, concluding that 46% prefer Harris\u2019s policies on taxes for the middle class, compared to 35% for Trump. The US vice-president also has a slight edge on the cost of housing, while voters are evenly split on which of the pair has the better policies on the prices of groceries and petrol, and creating jobs or addressing unemployment. The boost to Harris comes even as a majority of voters, 62%, believe the economy is in poor condition, compared with 38% who say the opposite. The outlook is more positive than in October last year, when nearly three in four people said the economy was in poor shape. The Trump campaign has long sought to make inflation and rising living costs a focal point of its critique of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. Harris, since replacing Biden as the Democrats\u2019 nominee in July, has launched a counteroffensive that involves putting proposals for an \u201copportunity economy\u201d at the heart of her campaign message \u2013 including a pledge to give first-time buyers $25,000 towards a down payment on a new home. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, stressed economic themes in a CNN interview on Sunday in which he rebutted suggestions that voters were primarily concerned with Trump\u2019s increasingly erratic campaign rhetoric and actions, including shutting down audience questions at a town hall in order to shuffle aimlessly to music for 39 minutes. \u201cThe big question \u2013 and the one that Kamala Harris has not been able to answer \u2013 is: are you better off now than under the Trump administration, four years ago?\u201d Johnson said. \u201cNo one can answer that question with a yes.\u201d The Harris campaign has deployed Bill Clinton to sell the vice-president\u2019s economic message, with a particular focus on rural and Black voters. Clinton\u2019s role as an economic messenger is partly a product of his successful 1992 presidential campaign, which was distinctive largely because of its focus on economic issues, as summarised by the famous phrase \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid,\u201d coined by its chief strategist James Carville. At a rally last Friday in Wilmington in North Carolina \u2013 a key battleground state where the two candidates are neck and neck \u2013 the former Democratic president said Harris\u2019s economic proposals would ease circumstances for the majority. \u201cShe wants to help the middle class and working people with lower incomes work their way into the middle class,\u201d Clinton said. Clinton has also offered a nuanced view of the state of the contemporary economy, acknowledging inflation under the Biden administration but explaining why it occurred. At the Democratic national convention in August, he said the US had created 51m jobs since the end of the cold war, and that 50m of them had come under Democratic administrations. \u201cI swear I checked this three times. Even I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the score? Democrats 50, Republicans one.\u201d"

            "title": "OBR says budget unlikely to lift economic growth over next five years",
            "date": "2024-10-30T19:23:19Z",
            "content": "Labour has embarked on a \u201clarge, sustained increase in spending, tax and borrowing\u201d, according to the government\u2019s economic forecaster, as it judged that Labour\u2019s first budget for 15 years is unlikely to increase economic growth over the next five years. Assessing Rachel Reeves\u2019s policies, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the economy would expand at the same rate as predicted in March by the end of the parliament, despite a \u00a370bn-a-year rise in spending. The extra spending revealed by Reeves would give a short-term lift to economic output, it said, but leave the average rate of growth over the next five years unchanged. A change in the budget rules that allows for a spending increase will swell the size of the state to 44% of annual national income, five percentage points higher than before the pandemic.Richard Hughes, the head of the OBR, said the effect of an increase in taxes of \u00a340bn would take the tax take each year as a proportion of national income to a historic high of 38% by 2029-30. Hughes said: \u201cAgainst a largely unchanged economic and fiscal backdrop since our last forecast in March, this budget delivers one of the largest increases in spending, tax and borrowing of any single fiscal event in history.\u201d The larger state will \u201ccrowd out\u201d business activity and business investment, the OBR said, pushing living standards down by about 1% in the last year of its five-year forecast. Inflation will be slightly higher than previously estimated and wages slightly lower than previously forecast after a \u00a326bn hit to business costs from the chancellor\u2019s decision to raise employers\u2019 national insurance. The expanded state will be competing with the private sector for the same scarce resources, pushing up prices. David Miles, the chief economic adviser to the OBR, said: \u201cThe [fall in disposable incomes] is inevitable when the government is taking 2% of national income to spend on public services and public investment.\u201d Brexit will also hurt the UK\u2019s growth prospects by lowering trade intensity with the EU by 15%. Trade intensity measures a drop in trade with the EU relative to the bloc\u2019s trade with the rest of the world. Hughes said the increase in borrowing would cost the government more than \u00a3100bn in debt payments in each year of the parliament for the first time following an average annual rise of \u00a332bn over the next five years. There was a better outlook for the economy over the next two years, compared with a revised outlook since March, but a weaker rate of expansion in the second half of the parliament, the OBR added. A prediction in March that the economy would grow by 0.8% this year was revised up to 1.1%, in line with the outlook by the International Monetary Fund and just below the 1.2% forecast by the Bank of England. Next year the economy is expected to expand by 2%, compared with the 1.8% expected in March. However, the growth rate will slow in subsequent years compared with the forecast in March. In 2026, the OBR said growth would be 1.8%, down from 2% in March and 1.5% in 2027, down from the 1.8% prediction in March. Over the longer term, the improvements in public services expected to be funded by the budget will add 1.5% to economic growth. Hughes said two new budget rules would govern how the government taxes and spends. One rule forces the chancellor to keep day-to-day spending in balance. The other allows the Treasury to include government assets in its calculation of the national debt. Reeves said she had adopted a new measure of national debt to align with the way it is calculated in France, Germany and Japan. The switch to public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL) will capture assets such as student loans and investments made through government agencies. Conservative spending plans implied \u00a319bn of real-terms cuts in 2028-29 for unprotected departments such as justice and transport. Reeves, who vowed there would be no austerity under Labour, pumped most of her extra spending into the NHS. She said defence spending would remain above the commitment made to Nato of 2% of national income. However, the OBR said this had been achieved after reducing a growth rate of 3% in defence spending this year to zero next year, once adjusted for inflation."

            "date": "2024-10-28T00:01:14Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s Alternative Investment Market (Aim) has shrunk to its smallest size in 23 years as business owners and investors anticipate an abolition of inheritance tax relief in the budget this week. The accountancy group UHY Hacker Young calculated that 92 companies have delisted from Aim, London\u2019s junior stock market, in the past year, reducing the total number of companies on Aim to 695. Twenty-six companies have delisted from Aim since the general election in July, taking the total below 700 for first time since 2001. UHY Hacker Young said the possibility that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, would scrap inheritance tax (IHT) relief on Aim shares was hurting the index, with only 10 companies floating on the market in the last year. The value of the Aim market has fallen by 6% since Labour\u2019s election win on 4 July, while the blue-chip FTSE 100 index has been flat over the same period. Aim has fallen by more than 10% since Rishi Sunak called the election in May. Under current rules, Aim shares qualify for business property relief, meaning they avoid IHT if they have been held for more than two years at the time of death. This has made them attractive to wealthier families, looking for ways to pass on more of their money untaxed to their descendants. Colin Wright, a partner and the group chair at UHY Hacker Young, said: \u201cAs Aim experiences a further glut of companies leaving the exchange, the government needs to urgently address how it can help. Cutting IHT relief on Aim shares would do the opposite.\u201d He added: \u201cWith fewer companies now listed on Aim, and with fewer companies looking to join, the government should be looking at maximising incentives for both companies and investors in small caps.\u201d According to Dominic Tayler, the UK managing director at Oakglen Wealth, 15% of Aim shares are held through business relief-based funds for inheritance tax purposes. Tayler says that Aim has been hit by a fall in liquidity in recent years, as investors have switched to passive, or tracker, funds that track the main market moves, and as pension funds have ignored smaller companies. \u201cSpeculation around the removal of business relief for Aim in the forthcoming budget has compounded this. Not only is this bad for business, it also harms long-term savers who are the life blood of private investment,\u201d Tayler said. This month, the British online retailer N Brown joined the ranks of companies leaving Aim, by accepting a takeover bid by Joshua Alliance, whose family control the company. Alliance said N Brown was not benefiting from being listed on the Aim market, and would have to bear \u201csignificant costs\u201d associated with its listing. Research commissioned by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) found that Aim companies contributed \u00a368bn in gross value added to the UK economy last year, and paid \u00a35.4bn in corporation tax. In September, Marcus Stuttard, the head of Aim and UK primary markets at LSEG, wrote that Aim had helped more than 4,000 companies to raise nearly \u00a3135bn from investors since it was created in 1995. Stuttard argued that Aim had made an important contribution to the UK economy through company tax contributions, creating jobs and expanding supply chains. \u201cAs Aim turns 30, we should celebrate the success of companies past and present who have made such an important contribution to our economy. But it is vital that we protect the market and its structures so that companies in the future can continue to support this positive legacy of economic growth and deliver returns for investors and savers,\u201d he added."

            "date": "2024-10-21T13:27:51Z",
            "content": "When CD sales took off in the late 80s, many believed it sounded the death knell for the old-fashioned vinyl album. Fast forward 40 years and records are the in thing again, so much so that the high street retailer WH Smith is bringing them back after a three-decade hiatus. The records will be stocked in 80 high street shops across the country for the first time since the 90s, as the retailer tries to attract \u201cseasoned fans and new listeners alike\u201d. According to data from the BPI, the UK record labels association, vinyl purchases reached 5.9m units during 2023 \u2013 their highest annual level since 1990. In the UK, sales were given an extra boost by Taylor Swift\u2019s album 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), which was crowned the biggest vinyl album of 2023, with more than 84,700 copies sold since its release last October. The biggest vinyl LP of the year by a British artist was the Rolling Stones\u2019 Hackney Diamonds, at number two. WH Smith first began selling vinyl albums in the 1950s, with records becoming a key product category for the retailer. But they were discontinued in the 1990s as CDs took off. The record renaissance has also brought about a rise in the number of indie record stores across the UK. A study by ERA, the digital entertainment and retail association, found that there are now 461 indie record shops in the UK, 122 more than 2014. In 2014, indie shops made up just 3% of total music outlets in the UK, but the figure is now 23%. This reflects the drop in the number of supermarkets and other big stores selling music. The music retailer HMV reopened its flagship record store in 2019 after a four-year absence, with an entire floor dedicated to vinyl LPs and CDs. This year, records were also added to the list of products used to calculate annual inflation for the first time since they dropped off in 1992. Emma Smyth, commercial director of WH Smith\u2019s high street operations, said: \u201cTo me it\u2019s no surprise that vinyl is growing in popularity again, and we are very excited to be bringing back record selections to more than 80 different stores across the UK for both seasoned fans and new listeners alike.\u201d Vinyl would be stocked in WH Smith stores in Canterbury, Chester, Edinburgh Gyle and York, among others, the group said."

            "content": "New York City police arrested numerous pro-Gaza protesters outside the New York Stock Exchange on Monday after a demonstration highlighting Israel\u2019s ongoing attacks on Gaza and Lebanon. Demonstrators voiced chants such as \u201cLet Gaza live!\u201d and \u201cUp up with liberation, down down with occupation!\u201d and managed to get inside a security fence outside the exchange on Broad Street in downtown Manhattan. They then sat down and waited for police to take them into custody, according to the Associated Press. Jewish Voice for Peace, which organized the protest, said: \u201c\ufeff200 Jews are risking arrest risking arrest in the largest act of civil disobedience in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. \u201cStocks are rising while children are dying. As Israel drops bombs on homes, schools, and hospitals in Gaza, Wall Street booms, and all the members of Congress who invest in these companies get richer every day,\u201d Jay Saper of Jewish Voice for Peace said in a press release. Video of the protest posted by independent journalist Noah Hurowitz on Twitter/X shows a large group of protesters walking briskly toward the exchange, converging in front of the entrance, and blocking it. Police reportedly told some media that there had been up to 200 arrests. Asked to confirm the number of arrests, an NYPD spokesperson said there had been multiple, but that they did not have a final number yet. Police were also witnessed detaining a credentialed journalist and then released her shortly thereafter, Hurowitz said on X. The demonstration came a week after the one-year anniversary of Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack against Israel. Hamas fighters crossed into Israel from Gaza and killed 1,200 people, including more than 40 Americans, and took at least 251 hostages of whom nearly 100 remain in Gaza, according to NBC News. Israel has since carried out a military campaign in Gaza. The Gaza ministry of health says that more than 41,000 have died, ABC News said. The Israel-Gaza war has expanded into other parts of the region and stoked fears that military action will spread further, especially if Iran carries out larger attacks than it has done so far. Hezbollah, allied with Iran, on 8 October 2023 started launching rockets at northern Israel in support of Hamas. The conflict deepened recently after Israel bombed southern Lebanon, the Bekaa valley and Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, and deployed ground troops across the border. \u201cAt this very moment, the Israeli military is massacring family after family in North Gaza \u2013 with US-made bombs. The Biden Administration wants the public to believe that the US\u2019s $18 billion slushfund for Israel\u2019s genocide is for the sake of \u2018Jewish safety,\u2019\u201d Elena Stein, director of organizing strategy for Jewish Voice for Peace, said in a press release. \u201cWe\u2019re here refusing to be used as the US\u2019s moral cover and to expose its true interests: financial gain and control in the region. Weapons embargo now,\u201d Stein also said."

            "date": "2024-10-15T14:07:33Z",
            "content": "Boeing is seeking to raise up to $25bn (\u00a319bn) in an attempt to shore up its finances as the planemaker struggles with production delays amid a strike by 33,000 workers and ongoing safety concerns. A regulatory filing by the company on Tuesday said it intended to raise the money through a stock and debt offering, which would provide flexibility for Boeing to seek options to support its balance sheet over a three-year period. It also entered into a separate $10bn credit agreement with a consortium of banks, which it said would provide short-term access to liquidity as it navigated through a \u201cchallenging environment\u201d. Production at the planemaker has been hobbled by the strike that began a month ago, which is estimated to have cost the company more than $1bn, according to Reuters. Last week, the company withdrew its offer of a 30% pay rise over four years for striking staff after talks with unions broke down, and later in the week it announced plans to shed 17,000 jobs \u2013 about 10% of its global workforce \u2013 to cut costs. The strikes add to a tumultuous year for Boeing, which began in January when a door panel blew out in mid-air from one of its 737 Max 9s shortly after it took off from Portland, Oregon. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) then enforced a cap on the production of the Max jets. In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a US criminal fraud charge stemming from the crashes of two 737 Max jetliners in 2018 and 2019, which killed 346 people, and agreed to pay a fine of almost $250m (\u00a3191m). It was not clear when or how much the company expected to raise through the offering announced on Tuesday but analysts predicted it would be completed before the end of the year. Boeing is also facing $11.5bn of debt maturing through February 2026, while it has committed to issuing $4.7bn of its shares to acquire Spirit AeroSystems, as well as take on its debt. The deal to buy back the parts supplier, which it sold off nearly 20 years ago, was part of its plan to boost safety on production lines. In a statement with the filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Boeing said: \u201cThis universal shelf registration provides flexibility for the company to seek a variety of capital options as needed to support the company\u2019s balance sheet over a three-year period.\u201d The separate $10bn credit facility was struck with banks including Citibank and Goldman Sachs but the manufacturer confirmed it had yet to draw any money from it. It said: \u201cThese are two prudent steps to support the company\u2019s access to liquidity.\u201d"

            "content": "The rolling stock firm Porterbrook paid out \u00a380m in dividends to its mainly overseas shareholders last year, accounts show, fuelling further calls for Britain\u2019s trains to be nationalised. The firm\u2019s train leasing arm made profits of \u00a3144m in 2023, when the railway was still beset by strikes over frozen pay and passengers faced widespread cancellations and fare rises of almost 6%. Unions described the figures as \u201cshocking but unsurprising\u201d after years of Porterbrook and other rolling stock firms continuing to pay out large dividends to shareholders, despite the downturn in the wider rail industry\u2019s revenues. The pay of Porterbrook\u2019s chief executive, Mary Grant, rose to almost \u00a31.4m \u2013 more than double that of the chief executive of Network Rail. Just more than \u00a3150m was paid in dividends from Porterbrook\u2019s leasing arm to its parent company, Porterbrook Holdings, in the 12 months to December 2023, according to accounts filed this month. The holdings firm paid out \u00a380m in dividends to its shareholders, led by the insurer Allianz and the Canadian pension fund AIM. It is the second successive year it has returned \u00a380m in dividends. Unions argue that the hundreds of millions in profits diverted overseas by Porterbrook, Eversholt, Angel Trains and others should be reinvested in rail. Labour has started legislating to renationalise train operating firms but not the rolling stock firms, which would require a huge capital outlay. A spokesperson for Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 trade union, said: \u201cThese new figures are shocking, but not surprising. The privatisation of the RoSCos, the rolling stock companies, by John Major in 1994 was the most egregious example of all the Tories\u2019 privatisations. \u201cThe new Labour government is doing a great job bringing the passenger companies back into public ownership. Now, though, the government must turn its attention to the freight companies, and the rolling stock companies, which are turning the taxpayer over big time. We have to get their snouts out of the public trough.\u201d Porterbrook said it had spent \u00a33.5bn on rolling stock and hundreds of millions more in upgrading fleets and testing green technology. A spokesperson said: \u201cPorterbrook is able to invest and innovate for the future of the railway because of the funding that our shareholders provide, and in the normal course of business, when appropriate, dividends are paid.\u201d"

            "content": "A closely watched measure of US inflation has slipped to its lowest level since 2021, within striking distance of policymakers\u2019 target, after the Federal Reserve scrambled to bring down price growth from its highest level in a generation. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at an annual rate of 2.1% last month, down from 2.2% in August and in line with economists\u2019 expectations. The progress was underlined by official data released five days before the US presidential election. The state of the world\u2019s largest economy \u2013 and the cost of living in it \u2013 has played a central role in the contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to succeed Joe Biden. Inflation surged three years ago, peaking at its highest level in four decades as the impact of Covid-19 continued to roil the global economy. Officials at the Fed, having initially insisted that an acceleration in price growth would be \u201ctransitory\u201d, later engineered an extraordinary U-turn and embarked upon an aggressive campaign to tackle it. The Fed would go on to lift interest rates to a two-decade high \u2013 and only started to cut them last month. The central bank\u2019s effort was designed to bring inflation down to its target of 2%. The so-called \u201ccore\u201d PCE index \u2013 which strips out volatile food and energy costs \u2013 rose 2.7% in September, in line with recent months, but slightly above economists\u2019 expectations of 2.6%. While inflation has fallen dramatically, years of price increases continue to take their toll on many Americans. The economy has remained remarkably resilient \u2013 and continued to grow at a robust pace in the third quarter, according to data released on Wednesday \u2013 but almost half of voters wrongly believe the US is in recession, according to a Harris Poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian last month. Such polling frustrated Biden. When the president withdrew from the election this summer, making way for Harris, his vice-president was more willing to acknowledge that the cost of living remained \u201cjust too high\u201d for many. As Trump has argued that America is in economic decline, the White House has sought to underline positive economic figures in recent months. Hiring unexpectedly accelerated in September, and data for October will be released on Friday."

            "date": "2024-10-16T10:04:42Z",
            "content": "Last month\u2019s surprise fall in UK inflation lands with bad timing for millions of people who receive state benefits linked to the figure, who can now expect their payments to rise by just 1.7% next April. A number of benefits, including universal credit, are increased each tax year in line with the cost of living figure for the previous September. The decline in the annual price growth figure in September, driven by falling air fares and transport costs, disguised larger increases in some categories, including food and drink, which recorded inflation of 1.8%. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said the 1.7% figure would mean that a typical low-income family, with two children, on universal credit would receive an increase of \u00a3253 in their annual payment from next April. It said the fall in the headline rate was likely to be temporary as previous falls in energy prices dropped out of the 12-month inflation calculation, and suggested inflation could increase again in October to 2.2%. If that higher figure were used, the same family would be \u00a374 better off as the annual increase would be \u00a3327. By contrast, state pensioners are protected by the triple lock, which stipulates that their annual increase in payments is in line with whichever is highest of earnings, inflation or 2.5%. Next year, the rise will be in line with wages, meaning an increase of 4.1% in April \u2013 adding \u00a3473 a year to the full state pension. Lalitha Try, an economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cThis temporary [inflation] fall is badly timed for millions of low- to middle-income families as it will result in a lower increase in their benefits next year. A more timely measure of benefit uprating would deliver a cash gain to a low-income family with kids of around \u00a374 next year. The government needs to address the age divide in benefits which has left working-age support fall further behind rising wages and living standards.\u201d September\u2019s inflation figure has also increased market bets that the Bank of England will cut interest rates again to 4.75% when it meets next month, which would be good news for borrowers but would be likely to lead to a cut in savings rates."

The consumer price index rose at an annual pace of 2.4% in September, slightly higher than economists\u2019 expectations of 2.3%, and down from 2.5% in August. The so-called \u201ccore\u201d index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, increased at an annual rate of 3.3%. Over the month, prices rose 0.2%.

            "date": "2024-10-02T19:00:56Z",
            "content": "With a pandemic that upended global trade through lockdowns and travel restrictions still fresh in managers\u2019 minds, international supply chains are again under pressure. Shippers are facing myriad issues, from the conflict in the Middle East and drought in Central America to strike action in the US, and companies are finding it more difficult \u2013 and more expensive \u2013 to transport supplies. So, how bad is the supply chain squeeze? Why are supply chains under pressure? Global shippers have been faced with a growing number of headaches in moving goods over the last year. At the top of this list is the disruption in the Middle East and the impact on the movement of trade through the Red Sea. Traffic has plummeted by two-thirds through the key shipping route since attacks on vessels by Houthi rebels began last year. The route accounted for 12% of all global trade before the attacks began. Many companies, including major shipping firms such as Maersk, have all but abandoned the route, instead opting to travel around the Cape of Good Hope, which can add 10 days to journeys, and significant costs. A fresh flare-up of tensions in the Middle East in recent days has raised fears that even more ships may shun the route. Peter Sand, chief analyst at shipping analytics platform Xeneta, believes the latest escalation will have a smaller impact, as most container ships are already avoiding the Red Sea. However, he warns that a \u201cfurther deterioration in the political situation means a large-scale return of container ships to the Red Sea region seems to be a more distant prospect\u201d. Separately, traffic through the Panama Canal has also dropped after a drought forced its operator to reduce the cap on the number of ships that could travel through it earlier this year, from 36 a day to 20. Fears of trade disruption have been further exacerbated by the port workers\u2019 strikes on the east coast of the US. On Tuesday, nearly 50,000 members of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association went on strike indefinitely, affecting 14 ports across the east coast of the US. Marco Forgione, director general at the Chartered Institute of Export and International Trade, said all of these issues have meant \u201chighly fragile\u201d supply chains are facing \u201cexceptional pressures\u201d. He said Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the US-China trade standoff, as well as events such as the Baltimore bridge collapse, have added to supply chain pressures. What has been the impact so far? The biggest impact from the disruptions has been on the cost for business to transport goods. Freight companies opting for the Cape of Good Hope route face an added 40% in fuel costs, while container prices have also risen. According to Xeneta, spot rates for 40ft shipping containers moving between the east Asia and northern Europe stood at $8,587 a container when the market peaked in July \u2013 468% higher than in December 2023, before the Houthi attacks ramped up. The US port strikes have already affected container prices from northern Europe to the east coast of America, with an average 40ft container costing $2,861 on Tuesday, compared with $1,836 at the end of August. The disruption, particularly in the Red Sea, has also led to longer lead times for companies. Earlier this year, manufacturers and retailers said the diversion around Africa to avoid the Red Sea had added four weeks to delivery times. Carmakers such as Volvo and Tesla have had to suspend production lines because of a lack of parts as a result of the disruption. Meanwhile, retailers in the UK, including DFS and JD Sports, have said the Red Sea crisis has hit some sales. Forgione said continued disruption would ultimately hit the consumer. He said: \u201cWhere there is instability and uncertainty, the impacts are either price increases, \u2018shrinkflation\u2019, or you\u2019re going to see availability issues.\u201d What is the outlook for oil prices? The oil price climbed for a second consecutive day to almost $76 a barrel on Wednesday, from $71 at the start of the week. Some analysts believe it could break $80 within days. The market is braced for a potential threat to Iran\u2019s crude output by an Israeli retaliation against its oil infrastructure. Goldman Sachs estimates Iran can produce 1m barrels of oil a day. But there could be further disruption to supplies if problems with key shipping routes through the Red Sea affect crude exports from the wider Middle East region. In an \u201cunlikely tail scenario\u201d, Goldman Sachs warned that an interruption of oil trade through the strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, would result in a \u201clarge oil price spike\u201d. However, Saudi Arabia has said prices could actually fall, to about $50 a barrel, due to a supply glut as it tries to regain market share. Could inflation start rising again? The cost of oil and gas began to soar in 2021, sending inflation above 10% and pushing up the price of everything from food to household energy bills. Inflation has tumbled back to near the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target over the last year, but left prices more than 20% higher than before the pandemic, giving households a financial shock. Brexit has pushed up the price of imported goods from the EU, while the US\u2019s trade war with China threatens to widen into a broader battle over tariffs. The UK is one of the most open trading nations in the world and the scars from the pandemic and two major conflicts are being deeply felt by importers and exporters. If they choose to pass on those costs to consumers, then Britons may face a squeeze on their budgets again."

            "title": "Inflation expectations can be self-fulfilling. Here\u2019s why that matters for Australia",
            "date": "2024-10-16T03:23:37Z",
            "content": "Sarah Hunter, the Reserve Bank\u2019s chief economist, has given a speech about \u201cinflation expectations\u201d at the Citi investor conference in Sydney on Wednesday, drawing on new research from the central bank. Here are four takeaways: What are inflation expectations and why do they matter? We anticipate a lot of things, such as the weather, and (often) modify our behaviour and clothing accordingly. So it is with inflation. If people experience rising prices, they assess \u2013 with some caveats \u2013 how they think about future prices and make adjustments. Those changes might be to ask for a bigger pay rise or to set a higher price for goods or services if they\u2019re in business. And, as Hunter said, expectations can be self-fulfilling: \u201cMacroeconomists generally think that a prerequisite for consistently achieving low and stable inflation over time is well anchored inflation expectations,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is, people across the economy believe inflation will generally average a low rate (in Australia\u2019s case 2%-3%), and they make decisions based on this underlying belief that becomes self-reinforcing. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email What did the research into expectations show? Hunter said the findings were \u201cgood news\u201d. Inflation expectations \u201cappear\u201d to be sliding back towards long-term norms and had \u201cremained anchored\u201d during the recent price spurt (unlike, say, in T\u00fcrkiye). And if actual inflation had lately been \u201csticky\u201d (to cite previous RBA officials\u2019 speeches), there was \u201cno evidence of expectations being more persistent than normal\u201d, she said. Importantly, though, the research (by Anthony Brassil, Yahdullah Haidari, Jonathan Hambur, Gulnara Nolan and Callum Ryan) found the RBA\u2019s model was more pessimistic about how households and unions would be about inflation than turned out to be the case. Guardian Australia asked Hunter: if the model over-anticipated inflation expectations, does it follow official interest rates might not need to stay as high for as long? \u201cInflation expectations are just one part of what determines actual inflation outcomes, of course, and broader economic outcomes as well,\u201d and the RBA would consider \u201cthat much bigger picture\u201d. No cigar then. (Markets are rating only a 60% chance of an RBA interest rate cut by February, as of yesterday.) Some price rises have more impact than others Consumers (and businesses) form views about where inflation is headed based on a range of \u201csalient\u201d items that are taken as proxies for what\u2019s happening more broadly. Groceries and rent are obvious ones but energy prices, particularly motor fuel, tend to carry more sway than others. (Blame those red neon price signs at servos perhaps.) And yet drivers seem to discern that price spikes from \u201cshocks\u201d (think Ukraine) may only be temporary. It needs \u201can extended period\u201d of unusually high (or low) fuel prices before there\u2019s \u201ca meaningful impact on expectations\u201d, the model suggests. For instance, fuel price inflation was 61% between the start of 2021 and mid-2022 before dropping back to \u201caround\u201d historical averages. \u201cSalient\u201d fuel prices did not bounce around like actual bowser bills did, it seems. We asked if that meant the RBA might \u201clook through\u201d another oil price spike (eg should Israel attack Iran\u2019s oil industry) since consumers\u2019 views take some budging. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful in terms of knowing that inflation expectations hopefully would stay anchored through a future period like that,\u201d Hunter said, adding the \u201ccontext\u201d mattered. There are no \u201chard and fast\u201d rules. Is \u2018rational inattentiveness\u2019 really rational? Among other findings: most households are slower to adjust their anticipation of future inflation based on \u201clived experience\u201d compared with unions. Inflation has to be \u201cpersistently higher or lower than previously expected for expectations to change significantly\u201d, Hunter said. The outcome is consistent with a so-called \u201crational inattention\u201d hypothesis. The longish period when inflation was low and stable meant people didn\u2019t think it was worth worrying too much about inflation, so they didn\u2019t. However, the recent experience may have shaken some of that complacency. Might that lead to \u201cirrational attention\u201d? (We can think of one example: electricity prices. These make up about half of petrol/diesel\u2019s share of the CPI basket but attract far more media notice.) And, as a concept, can we put much store in experiences as a guide to the future? Few of us can envisage future extreme weather that physics tells us to anticipate as global heating intensifies, but that doesn\u2019t mean under-preparation is rational. Inflation expectations might also be among the least of our worries at some point. Peter Hannam is Guardian Australia\u2019s economics correspondent"

            "content": "Germany\u2019s economy grew in the three months to the end of September, ending fears that Europe\u2019s largest economy would slip back into recession. Predictions that the German economy would shrink for a second consecutive quarter proved unfounded as gross domestic product increased by 0.2% in the third quarter after a 0.3% contraction in the previous quarter. Germany\u2019s minister for economic affairs, Robert Habeck, said: \u201cThis is still far from what we need, but at least it is a ray of hope.\u201d Growth in Germany lifted the wider eurozone economy, which expanded by 0.4% in the third quarter, twice the 0.2% rate predicted by economists. Economists said the inflation shock that followed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 sparking a dramatic increase in energy and food prices that undermined business and consumer confidence across the eurozone \u2013 was beginning to ease. Alexander Kr\u00fcger, the chief economist at the private bank Hauck Aufha\u00fcser Lampe, said: \u201cUnder the weight of many structural weaknesses, the economy is sending out a sign of life. This is thanks to the consumers, who have let their guard down a little.\u201d The consultancy Oxford Economics said the available information suggested most of the growth across the eurozone came from household and government spending, while investment continued to be restricted by high interest rates. France\u2019s economy expanded by 0.4%, up from 0.2% in the second quarter, thanks to a boost from the Olympic Games in the summer, while Spain marked itself out as Europe\u2019s growth hub, growing by 0.8%, largely due to a surge in tourism. Only Italy was among Europe\u2019s large economies to stagnate in the third quarter. Giorgia Meloni\u2019s government is officially forecasting the Italian economy will grow by 1% this year, but after downward revisions to the first two quarters, the economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, said this month that the goal may be out of reach. Moody\u2019s Analytics\u2019 senior economist, Kamil Kovar, said the figures put to rest any questions of whether the eurozone was in recession. \u201cIt is not, and such worries were always overblown. \u201cThat said, there is a clear continuing weakness in investment, suggesting that worries about the outlook are not completely misplaced. \u201cWe believe that today\u2019s release, together with the rebound in inflation, will shut down any talk about [a] jumbo-sized cut at the December European Central Bank meeting, and we also remain skeptical about expectations of a rate cut in January.\u201d"

            "content": "Eurozone GDP grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of this year, twice as fast as the 0.2% growth expected. That follows Germany\u2019s welcome dodging of a recession, and France\u2019s Olympics-fuelled growth over the summer, which we\u2019ve seen this morning. Rachel Reeves has announced \u00a340bn of tax rises on businesses and the rich as Labour\u2019s first budget in 14 years sought to reverse more than a decade of decline in Britain\u2019s public services. After months of speculation since the party\u2019s general election landslide victory, the chancellor revealed a sweeping package of tax increases she said would be vital to balance the books and turn the page on austerity. \u201cThe only way to improve living standards, and the only way to drive economic growth is to invest, invest, invest,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cThere are no shortcuts, and to deliver that investment, we must restore economic stability and turn the page on the last 14 years.\u201d At its heart was an increase in national insurance contributions (Nics) paid by employers \u2013 worth \u00a325bn by the end of this parliament \u2013 alongside billions of pounds in increases from changes to capital gains tax, inheritance tax, VAT on private schools and the non-dom tax regime. In financial markets, borrowing costs initially fell, as investors welcomed the confirmation of large tax hikes. But the rally reversed \u2013 causing bond prices to fall and and yields (or interest rates) to rise, as the City digested the sharp increase in government borrowing forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog. Our other main stories: Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Take care \u2013 JK John Burn-Murdoch, columnist and chief data reporter at the Financial Times, observed that the tax burden is also high in other countries. Economists at ING have looked at how the budget has been received in financial markets. Financial markets have been on a wild ride since the announcement of the UK\u2019s latest budget. Big tax rises are coming, but not as quickly as big spending increases. And the prospect of higher growth has led investors to curtail expectations for Bank of England rate cuts. Markets initially liked the tax hikes, but quick spotted the higher borrowing projection. UK bond yields did initially dip as the chancellor was speaking, and markets liked Rachel Reeves\u2019 confirmation that tax rises would raise \u00a340bn (1.5% GDP) per year. That\u2019s a big number by any comparison and is much more than Labour promised to raise during the general election. Investors also warmed to Reeves\u2019 commitment to balancing the current budget (day-to-day spending vs taxes), initially within five years, and latterly over three. But no sooner had the chancellor ended her speech did the tide quickly begin to turn. 10-year government bond (gilt) yields are up four basis points on the day, at the time of writing, and almost 15bp from the intraday low. Keith Cooney, head of business rates at the property firm Knight Frank, said: Today it was revealed that despite a change in government, the \u00a329bn business rates tax burden is set to increase again for 2025 with the largest ratepayers \u2013 which will include the country\u2019s key employers \u2013 being asked to effectively fund any support for SMEs. Despite pledges to support the high street the chancellor has cut the business relief for retail, leisure and hospitality from 75% to 40% albeit retaining the cap of \u00a3 110,000 per business. Moreover, the move to fund a reduction in the multiplier for retail, leisure and hospitality from 2026/7 with a higher rate targeting warehouses, is shortsighted as government is effectively taxing the infrastructure that these businesses rely on to move goods to their premises and directly to the consumer. This all adds even more complexity to an already highly complex system, and simply the shifts the tax liability without acknowledging that the tax burden on UK businesses is simply too high. It is difficult to see how these measures will help fix the foundations needed for economic recovery. Will Hutton, political economist and Observer columnist, wrote on X: Phil Vernon, head of business rates at PwC UK, said: The introduction of permanently lower business rates multipliers for high street retail, hospitality and leisure (RHL) properties from 2026-27 will be welcomed by these sectors. However, the government intends to fund the relief through a higher multiplier for properties with a Rateable Value over \u00a3500k. This is likely to spell higher rates bills for other property types such as offices, factories or distribution hubs from 2026. In the short term, the freeze in the small rates multiplier in 2025 is good news for many small businesses. Companies in the RHL sectors will be pleased with the extension of the current relief although this will be slightly tainted by the cutting of the relief from its current level of 75% to 40%. This would mean a single-property business with a gross rate charge of \u00a3100k would see their annual rates bill rise from \u00a325k to \u00a360k next April. In addition, with the relief capped at \u00a3110k per business, this means that the wider retail sector will not see a significant reduction in their rates bills until at least 2026, when the new multipliers are introduced. Andy Jones, partner at EY UK, has also looked at the retail measures. For retailers, the bottom line is that today\u2019s budget will likely result in increased cost pressures amid what is already a challenging backdrop. A particularly significant headline, as expected, is the proposed increase in the national minimum wage and National Insurance Contributions (NICs) for employers. Whilst good news for workers, this will impact retailers during a time of already-intense cost pressures. Moreover, whilst the announcement to ease the removal of the business rate discount will be welcome news for some businesses, it will still be an increase on the amounts paid today. That said, many may be hopeful that it is a first indication of the new government\u2019s approach to taxation and an indication that further reliefs that may come in the future. Therefore, overall, whilst the freeze on fuel duty and the reduction in alcohol duty rates for draught products will be welcomed, the budget will likely lead to increased inflationary pressures for retailers and likely price rises for consumers. Chris Sanger, EY\u2019s tax policy leader, added: Business rates is an area that governments have struggled with for at least the last decade. This is a tax that is paid regardless of whether a business is in the red or the black - whether there are profits to fund this tax or not. We have seen the tax rate increase from the low 40s to the high 50s, marking a big increase in the costs for those firms using real estate. Here is some reaction to the changes to business rates for shops, pubs, bars and restaurants. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, said next year \u201cwill be painful for hospitality,\u201d with an increased annual tax bill of \u00a33bn. This budget is the latest blow for hospitality businesses. Rising taxes, increasing costs and fragile consumer confidence risk bringing growth to a grinding halt. In the short-term, the tsunami of employment costs coming in April will ultimately do more to hamper growth than incentivise it. Increases to employer NICs and wages will make it harder for businesses to support employment and invest in their businesses. Avoiding the business rates cliff-edge next April was critical and it was important that some relief has been extended. However, the reduced level of 40% is another cost that businesses have to deal with. For those small- and medium-sized operators, their rates bills will still go up in April. But, she added: However, there are reasons for longer-term positivity. I am pleased that the chancellor is implementing UKHospitality\u2019s recommendation for a permanently lower level of business rates for hospitality. Levelling the playing field in this way recognises the importance of the high street and the role it plays in our communities and economy. Simon Green, head of business rates at property consultancy Gerald Eve, was more blunt. The decision to slash the retail, hospitality and leisure relief scheme from 75% to 40% is absolute madness. It will see rates bills more than double overnight for 250,000 small businesses, leading to business failures and job losses. Meanwhile\u2026 AstraZeneca\u2019s China president Leon Wang is standing back because he is under investigation by Chinese authorities, the UK\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical firm has announced. Wang, who is also the company\u2019s executive vice president for international markets, \u201cis cooperating with an ongoing investigation by Chinese authorities\u201d. It is not clear whether he has been detained. The company said: Our China operations continue under the leadership of the current general manager of AstraZeneca China. If requested, AstraZeneca will fully cooperate with the investigation. Michael Lai is general manager at AstraZeneca China. Last month, it emerged that five current and former AstraZeneca employees had been detained by Chinese police as part of an investigation into possible breaches related to data privacy and importing unlicensed medications. Update: Eight to nine current or former staff were detained. The detentions took place earlier this summer, and targeted Chinese citizens who marketed cancer drugs for the oncology division of the British drugmaker, in news first reported by Bloomberg. Police are investigating whether AstraZeneca employees were involved in importing a drug meant to treat liver cancer, but which had not been approved for distribution across mainland China. The investigation, which is being led by police in the Shenzhen region, is also examining the way the company collected patient data, and whether that may have broken China\u2019s privacy laws. China has become a big market for AstraZeneca, and it has invested heavily in the country, announcing plans last year to build a $450m factory and signing a number of licensing deals with Chinese companies, including one for an obesity and type 2 diabetes pill. It acquired the Shanghai-based Gracell Biotechnologies, which develops cell therapies for cancer and autoimmune disease, for $1.2bn earlier this year. To build 1.5m more homes in the coming five years, as the Labour government has pledged, Reeves has revealed \u00a35bn of government funding, including \u00a33.1bn for affordable housing (an increase of \u00a3500m). There is also \u00a33bn support for small housebuilders and the build-to-rent sector in the form of housing guarantee schemes. The chancellor also said that local authorities would hire \u201chundreds of new planning officers\u201d to speed up housebuilding. The government is reducing \u2018right to buy\u2019 discounts for council tenants to buy the homes they are living in, and local authorities get to keep full receipts from the sale of council homes. Following the deadly Grenfell fire in 2017, the government will spend \u00a31bn to remove dangerous cladding from tall buildings next year, Reeves said. Helen Barnard, director of policy, research &amp; impact at the charity Trussell Trust, posted on X: Rachel Reeves has announced permanently lower tax rates for retail, hospitality &amp; leisure properties from 2026-27, to help the high street. While relief on business rates for the industry is being extended, it will be reduced from 75% to 40% in 2025-26, up to a cap of \u00a3110,000 per business. The small business tax multiplier will be frozen next year. Those two measures amount to \u00a31.9bn of support to small businesses and the high street, according to the Treasury. Over in parliament, Rachel Reeves is presenting the budget, and revealed it includes \u00a340bn of tax rises \u2013 to address the \u2018black hole\u2019 in the public finances, and other unfunded commitments. You can track it all here: On the US GDP report, Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, says: \u201cToday\u2019s figures show that the economy has grown less than expected. In recent quarters we have seen the economy sustain healthy growth considering the point in the cycle and the time since the last recession, so it\u2019s not entirely surprising to see a slowdown today. It\u2019s important to remember that one report does not a trend make \u2013 this may be a change in the wind, but it also may just be a wobble. Overall, the economy is in a good place so we wouldn\u2019t expect today\u2019s numbers to factor too heavily in the Fed\u2019s next policy decision. Recession will likely not be at the top of central bankers\u2019 risk lists at this point \u2013 they\u2019ll be keeping a much closer eye on inflation and jobs numbers as they seek to maintain this period of calm.\u201d Newsflash: The US economy grew a little slower than expected in the last quarter. US GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.8% in July-September, new data show, the equivalent of 0.7% growth in the quarter. That\u2019s slightly below forecasts of a 3% annualised rise in GDP, and also a little slower than the 3% growth recorded in Q2. Boom! US companies created many more jobs than expected this month. US private sector payrolls rose by 233,000 jobs in October, data provider ADP reports, smashing forecasts of a 113,000 increase. That may show that the US labo(u)r market is stronger than thought, dampening the pace of interest rate cuts in the months ahead. Hopes of any good news \u201crabbits\u201d in the budget may be dashed, flags George Eaton of the New Statesman. Volkswagen has reported a 60% drop in profits amid a slump in sales in China, with the carmaker emphasising the difficulties it faces as it prepares to close factories in Germany for the first time. Germany\u2019s biggest carmaker has told workers it is considering shutting three plants serving its main Volkswagen brand in its home market and cutting staff pay, raising the prospect of an extended battle with unions representing 120,000 German employees. VW remains profitable but earnings before tax dropped almost 60% to \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) in the quarter from July to September, down from \u20ac5.8bn a year earlier. Carmakers around the world are struggling with limp demand for new vehicles as higher interest rates take their toll, while several \u2013 including VW\u2019s German rivals BMW and Mercedes-Benz \u2013 have reported that demand in China in particular has dropped. The British sportscar brand Aston Martin also confirmed on Wednesday that the \u201cweak macroeconomic environment in China\u201d was dragging it back. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is live-blogging all the UK budget action today, which you can see here: (I\u2019ll pop over to assist a little later, when Rachel Reeves begins her speech) The Institute for Fiscal Studies have published a handy thread on today\u2019s budget, highlighting how government spending and borrowing have risen in recent years: The London stock market has dipped very slightly this morning, but we can\u2019t blame the selloff \u2013 such as it is! - on the budget. GSK are the top faller, down 3.2%, after it cut its forecast for vaccine sales this morning (see 10.37am). Mining compan Anglo American is close behind, down 3.1%. That follows reports that global mining company BHP has \u201cmoved on\u201d from its three unsuccessful attempts to take over Anglo. Lloyds Bank are another faller, down 1.4%. It\u2019s caught up in last week\u2019s landmark court ruling over car finance mis-selling, which may lead to lenders paying out billions of pounds in compensation to borrowers. This has left the FTSE 100 share index down 18 points (-0.2%) at 8200 points, having earlier hit its lowest level since mid-September. Kyle Chapman, FX markets analyst at Ballinger Group says eurozone economic expansion was much stronger than expected at 0.4% in the third quarter. That has cut betting on a 50bp rate cut in December, and handing a modest boost to the euro, he says, adding: \u201cThe upbeat growth data will go a long way in alleviating the ECB\u2019s fears about faltering activity and undershooting inflation. There is a flicker here of the rising real wage, higher consumption path that policymakers had been flagging as the source of a rebound. My expectation is for policymakers to continue with back-to-back 25bp rate cuts, which will do the job just fine. There is no need to panic yet, and that takes a 50bp move off the table for now. That said, these are hardly figures to get excited about. Germany may have eked out a touch of growth, but that is from a weaker position in Q2 than previously thought and the structural headwinds to growth will evidently persist in the longer term. The quarterly growth data is backward looking and only captures one month of the poor PMI prints that have spooked the ECB into easing more aggressively. It points to a stronger outlook for consumption but does not preclude a fizzling out of the growth momentum in the fourth quarter which would reignite the discussion about a jumbo rate cut in December.\u201d The boss of British drugmaker GSK has called for the chancellor to encourage investment into the country through research and development tax credits. Speaking as the company published its third-quarter results, Emma Walmsley, GSK chief executive, said: \u201cWe remain very committed to this country as a company, with significant R&amp;D and manufacturing investment. \u201cIt is important for us that the fiscal environment remains competitive and you know, we\u2019re looking forward to seeing the details that are coming through. We want to see investment encouraged, whether that\u2019s through the patent box or research and development tax credits, and we\u2019ll see more on that today.\u201d R&amp;D tax credits are aimed to encourage investment in research and development by allowing companies to claim tax credits or reduce their tax bill by showing cash has been reinvested in research projects. The Patent Box is designed to encourage companies to keep intellectual property in the country by offering lower rates of corporation tax on profits made from inventions patented locally. The comments came as GSK\u2019s total sales for the three months up to 30 September hit \u00a38bn, a 2% increase from compared to the previous year. However, its vaccines sales forecast dropped for the year due to a sharp decline in sales of its new respiratory virus jab Arexvy. The jab which saw significant sales after its launch last year plunged 72% year-on-year to \u00a3188m, hit by fewer of the shots being given out in the US. UK government bonds are continuing to strengthen in morning trading, pushing down borrowing costs a little further. The yield (interest rate) on 10-year UK government debt is now down 7 basis points, at 4.23%, down from last night\u2019s five-month closing high of 4.3%. [bond yields fall when prices rise]. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says investors will be hoping this isn\u2019t simply the calm before the storm, adding: \u201cThe last thing the market wants is for Reeves to pull a Halloween-themed rabbit out of the hat that scares investors and causes another Liz Truss-era horror show. For all the wild speculation around what might be in the Budget, investors don\u2019t seem to be on tenterhooks going into the announcement.\u201d Research institute the National Institute of Economic and Social Research are hopeful that Rachel Reeves\u2019s new fiscal rules will create the space needed to drive investment, without undermining stability. Monica George Michail, associate economist at NIESR, says: The UK is at a critical juncture: after years of sluggish growth and deteriorating public infrastructure, a sustained rise in government investment is vital to promote long-term growth and boost living standards. Growing demands for defence and green infrastructure further add urgency for decisive action to secure the UK\u2019s economic future. We look forward to the Chancellor\u2019s budget announcement today and hope the new fiscal rules will strike a balance between creating fiscal space and ensuring long-term financial stability.\u201d Newsflash: the eurozone has beaten growth forecasts. Eurozone GDP grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of this year, twice as fast as the 0.2% growth expected. That follows Germany\u2019s welcome dodging of a recession, and France\u2019s Olympics-fuelled growth over the summer, which we\u2019ve seen this morning. Statistics body Eurostat says: Ireland (+2.0%) recorded the highest increase compared to the previous quarter, followed by Lithuania (+1.1%) and Spain (+0.8%). Declines were recorded in Hungary (-0.7%), Latvia (-0.4%) and Sweden (-0.1%). The year on year growth rates were positive for seven countries and negative for six. Sticking with Italy briefly, shares in drinks company Campari have dropped by 15% after its latest financial results disappointed the markets. Net sales at the spirits firm behind Aperol, Grand Marnier and Cinzano fell by 1.4% in the last quarter, missing forecasts of a rise. Campari blamed macroeconomic weakness, poor weather (it wasn\u2019t the best summer for a cheeky outdoor Aperol spritz), pressure on disposable income from inflation and falling confidence among consumers and retailers. Campari\u2019s pretax profits dropped by 20% in the quarter. Maybe they should consider bringing back those classic Cinzano adverts with Joan Collins &amp; Leonard Rossiter\u2026.. While Germany has beaten growth expectations, Italy has done worse than expected. Italian GDP was flat in July-September, new data this morning shows, worse than forecasts of 0.2% growth for Q3. The euro has jumped to its highest level in over a week, after Germany\u2019s economy avoided a recession in July-September. The single currency is up 0.25% at $1.0845, with investors calculating that hefty cuts to eurozone interest rates are now a little less likely. Reuters reports that the odds of a large, half-point, cut from the European Central Bank at its next meeting in December has dropped to 22%, from 45% early this morning. Newsflash: Germany has avoided falling into recession, in a welcome sign for Europe\u2019s largest economy. Germany\u2019s GDP expanded by 0.2% in July-September, new data shows, beating expectations of a contraction of 0.1%. That will be a relief for Berlin, at a time when Germany\u2019s economy is being buffered by high energy costs and problems in its car sector. BUT it\u2019s not all good news. Germany\u2019s second-quarter GDP report has been revised down, to show a contraction of 0.3% \u2013 worse than the 0.1% fall first reported. So the rise in activity in Q3 is against this new, lower, benchmark. UK bonds are recovering ahead of the Budget, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB: The UK\u2019s 10-year Gilt is outperforming its European counterparts with just a few hours to go before Rachel Reeves\u2019s first Budget, scheduled for 1230 GMT. Is this a sign that the bond market will welcome the fiscal shake up that is set to be announced later today? we could traders see \u2018sell the rumour and the buy the fact\u2019 in the UK Gilt market, once the uncertainty of the Budget is out of the way. Rachel Reeves may risk a sigh of relief if she checks the bond markets this morning, because UK government borrowing costs are dipping. The yield, or interest rate, on 10-year government bonds has dropped to 4.26% this morning, a fall of over basis points from last night\u2019s close of 4.3%. Yesterday, the 10-year yield hit its highest level since the general election. The yield on UK government debt (known as gilts) has been rising in recent weeks, up from 3.75% in mid-September. That could be a sign of investors anticipating the UK will issue more government debt \u2013 with increased supply weighing on prices (which fall when yields rise). But there are other factors too \u2013 including concerns over the US election, which have pushed up US borrowing costs. Japanese bank MUFG told clients this morning: UK Gilt yields have been rising this month with the 10-year yield up just over 30bps from the September close. But it is debatable how much of that move reflects fears over increased Gilt supply on the potential for increased borrowing. The US Treasury 10-year yield is up over 50bps this month on expectations of a Trump election victory next week and that is helping lift yields everywhere. UK firms expect no growth over the next three months, according to a new survey that shows the challenge facing Rachel Reeves to stimulate the economy. The CBI\u2019s latest Growth Indicator has shows that private sector firms expect no change in activity over the next three months. Alpesh Paleja, CBI interim deputy chief economist, says Reeves needs to boost business confidence today: \u201cOur latest surveys paint a picture of an economy shifting down a gear as we head into the final quarter of 2024. Weaker growth expectations are weighing on firms\u2019 hiring intentions, which have treaded water since the beginning of the summer. \u201cIn the budget, the Chancellor has an opportunity to boost confidence despite the difficult fiscal picture. Business will want to see messages of hard choices balanced with interventions that deliver a vision of optimism. \u2018Many businesses are very concerned about potential increases to Employers\u2019 NICs and the impact it will have on pay, hiring and investment. If the government does follow through, then they will want to see the government act on other key areas of investment, such as reforming the Apprenticeship Levy \u201cGiving firms certainty over future tax plans in the form of a business tax roadmap, measures to enhance productivity, and the country\u2019s net zero trajectory can all help cement the path to long-term growth.\u201d Shares in weapons producer BAE Systems have dropped by 1% in early trading, after a fire broke out at its shipyard in Cumbria, where British nuclear submarines are built. Two people were taken to hospital with suspected smoke inhalation after the fire at the shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness began at around 12.45am today. The police said there is \u201cno nuclear risk\u201d but residents should stay inside with doors and windows closed. BAE Systems said: \u201cWe are working with emergency services to deal with a fire at site in Barrow in Furness. Two colleagues have been taken to hospital having suffered suspected smoke inhalation.\u201d BBC Radio Cumbria\u2019s Jennie Dennett has reported that there is \u201cno sign of fire now\u201d but a \u201cmetallic smell of smoke in the air\u201d. BAE\u2019s shares have dropped by 1.25% to \u00a312.64, making it one of the top fallers on the FTSE 100 share index this morning. The cold snap this autumn has helped drive sales at retailer Next, putting it on track to make more than \u00a31bn profits this year. Next has raised its guidance for profits this year to \u00a31.005bn, up from \u00a3995m previously, after selling more stock than expected in the last three months. Next\u2019s full price sales in August-October were up 7.6% compared with last year, beating forecast of 5.0% growth. It told shareholders this morning: We believe the strong performance was driven by the early arrival of colder weather this year, versus an unusually warm September and early October last year. If Next were to hit \u00a31bn of profits for the first time, it would join only a handful of UK retailers that have done so, including Tesco \u2013 and Marks &amp; Spencer in a previous era. Next\u2019s shares have jumped by 1.3% in early trading. Hosting the Olympics this summer has helped the French economy to accelerate. France's GDP grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of this year, new data from statistics body INSEE this morning shows, up from 0.2% in April-June. The data suggests the summer sporting festivities boosted consumer spending \u2013 it rose by 0.5% in the third quarter after a flat performance in the second quarter. INSEE says GDP \u201caccelerated moderately in the third quarter\u2026.boosted by the Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games\u201d, adding: Final domestic demand (excluding inventories) regained some momentum, driven by a rebound in household consumption (+0.5% after +0.0%). Conversely, gross fixed capital formation continued to decline (-0.8% after -0.1%). Overall, domestic demand (excluding inventories) made a positive contribution to GDP growth this quarter: +0.2 points after +0.1 points in Q2 2024. Official data this morning could show that German output contracted again in the third quarter as its industrial slump drags on, tipping Europe\u2019s largest economy into recession. The AFP newswire reports: Federal statistics agency Destatis will unveil its quarterly GDP estimate at 09:00 GMT. The economy ministry has said it expects \u201ca renewed slight decline\u201d after gross domestic product already shrank by 0.1 percent in the second quarter. A technical recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. \u201cThe German economy is unlikely to have emerged from its weak phase in the third quarter,\u201d the ministry said in its autumn forecasts this month. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were narrowly more upbeat, predicting a quarter-on-quarter stagnation. Currency traders have been racing to protect themselves against possible big swings in the value of the pound, as the UK budget is released today. One-week implied options volatility - which measure the demand for protection against large moves in the pound over the coming week - have risen to 10.375%, Reuters reports, which is the highest since March 2023. The overnight rise from around 6.325% was the largest one-day increase in one-week implied volatility since September 2022, the month of Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget (which triggered the sort of market chaos that Rachel Reeves is desperate to avoid). Pepperstone strategist Chris Weston says today\u2019s budget is being taken more seriously by traders than usual: It\u2019s budget day in the UK, and while these events rarely pose the sort of risks to price action that warrants real focus on positioning, this one is different. It is seen by some as a generational budget, that will define Chancellor Reeves\u2019s career and could significantly impact Keir Starmer\u2019s public approval rating, which has been shot to pieces of late. Currently the pound is trading flat against the US dollar, at just over $1.30. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. It\u2019s a significant day in the UK and in Europe, with Rachel Reeves delivering Labour\u2019s first budget in almost 15 years, and growth data from across the eurozone likely to show Germany is in recession. Reeves could present one of the largest tax-raising budgets in decades today, as she tries to raise funds to repair UK public services. The chancellor is expected to announce a swathe of \u201cdifficult but necessary decisions\u201d to restore economic stability. She\u2019ll promise to \u201cinvest, invest, invest\u201d to drive economic growth and provide funding for the NHS, to build homes and rebuild schools. After a lot of gloominess since the July election, Reeves could strike a more optimistic note today, saying: \u201cMy belief in Britain burns brighter than ever. And the prize on offer today is immense. \u201cMore pounds in people\u2019s pockets. An NHS that is there when you need it. An economy that is growing, creating wealth and opportunity for all. Because that is the only way to improve living standards.\u201d Reeves is also expected to stick to Labour\u2019s pledge not to introduce higher taxes on working people. Instead, companies will carry a lot of the burden, with a rise in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions expected. Capital gains tax rates, or inheritance tax, may also be in the chancellor\u2019s sight. Income tax thresholds may be frozen for even longer than already planned, which will drag more people into higher tax rates as their salaries rise. Another measure \u2013 an inflation-busting rise in the minimum wage, was announced last night. Reeves will also set out the details of her changes to the UK\u2019s debt rules. She\u2019s expected to target public sector net financial liabilities (a measure known as PSNFL, or \u201cpersnuffle\u201d) which takes into account all the government\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, increasing her latitude to borrow for investment in long-term infrastructure. The Office for Budget Responsibility will give its verdict after the speech. The OBR is also expected to release its report into the spending forecast drawn up by the previous, Conservative, government for the spring budget in March, despite former chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s efforts to delay it. The report may show whether or not Labour was left with a \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d of unfunded commitments. Hunt says it\u2019s unfair to publish it on the day of the budget. The success of Reeves\u2019s first budget will be judged, eventually, by whether it does stimulate faster growth in the UK, leading to higher tax receipts to fund better public services. We\u2019ll get a taste of how other European countries fared last summer, with the first estimate of eurozone GDP for the third quarter of the year. Economists predict that Germany may have shrunk slightly in July-September, which would put Europe\u2019s largest economy into recession.

            "content": "A closely watched measure of US inflation has slipped to its lowest level since 2021, within striking distance of policymakers\u2019 target, after the Federal Reserve scrambled to bring down price growth from its highest level in a generation. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at an annual rate of 2.1% last month, down from 2.2% in August and in line with economists\u2019 expectations. The progress was underlined by official data released five days before the US presidential election. The state of the world\u2019s largest economy \u2013 and the cost of living in it \u2013 has played a central role in the contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to succeed Joe Biden. Inflation surged three years ago, peaking at its highest level in four decades as the impact of Covid-19 continued to roil the global economy. Officials at the Fed, having initially insisted that an acceleration in price growth would be \u201ctransitory\u201d, later engineered an extraordinary U-turn and embarked upon an aggressive campaign to tackle it. The Fed would go on to lift interest rates to a two-decade high \u2013 and only started to cut them last month. The central bank\u2019s effort was designed to bring inflation down to its target of 2%. The so-called \u201ccore\u201d PCE index \u2013 which strips out volatile food and energy costs \u2013 rose 2.7% in September, in line with recent months, but slightly above economists\u2019 expectations of 2.6%. While inflation has fallen dramatically, years of price increases continue to take their toll on many Americans. The economy has remained remarkably resilient \u2013 and continued to grow at a robust pace in the third quarter, according to data released on Wednesday \u2013 but almost half of voters wrongly believe the US is in recession, according to a Harris Poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian last month. Such polling frustrated Biden. When the president withdrew from the election this summer, making way for Harris, his vice-president was more willing to acknowledge that the cost of living remained \u201cjust too high\u201d for many. As Trump has argued that America is in economic decline, the White House has sought to underline positive economic figures in recent months. Hiring unexpectedly accelerated in September, and data for October will be released on Friday."

Almost half wrongly believe the US is in recession, according to a Harris Poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian last month. Years of rising prices continue to take their toll. In a speech in Washington on Tuesday, Harris once again tried to allay voters\u2019 fears.

Economists expect the economy to have added about 125,000 new positions over the month. That figure would be a sharp drop from the 250,000 jobs added in September, when hiring unexpectedly accelerated, and will probably reflect the strike at Boeing and the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. But there are signs that the US\u2019s resilient jobs market may also shake off last month\u2019s disruptions. On Wednesday ADP, the US\u2019s largest payroll supplier, said private companies hired 233,000 new workers in October, the best month for job creation since July 2023, up from 159,000 in September and far ahead of the estimated 113,000. \u201cEven amid hurricane recovery, job growth was strong in October,\u201d ADP\u2019s chief economist, Nela Richardson, said. \u201cAs we round out the year, hiring in the US is proving to be robust and broadly resilient.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-30T16:46:25Z",
            "content": "Lloyds Banking Group has scrapped commission payments across its \u00a315bn motor finance arm after a landmark ruling on car loan misselling, as industry and Treasury officials hold urgent talks amid fears of contagion across the wider financial sector. The moves follow last week\u2019s court of appeal judgment, which agreed that consumers could not have consented to loans that involved \u201csecret\u201d commission payments to brokers and car dealers. The shock decision has already forced the likes of Close Brothers \u2013 which was a defendant in the case \u2013 to pause all new lending as it prepares to challenge the ruling in the supreme court. Lloyds, which is the biggest motor finance provider among the UK\u2019s high street banks, has continued to issue new loans. However, the bank has had to \u201cadapt quickly\u201dto do so, its chief financial officer, William Chalmers, told analysts. That has involved immediately cancelling commission payouts to brokers from its Black Horse car finance division, which oversees \u00a315bn worth of loans. It has already put aside \u00a3450m for potential compensation, but analysts at RBC Capital believe the court decision could end up costing the lender between \u00a32.5bn and \u00a33.9bn in the worst case scenario. Lloyds shares have fallen nearly 13% since Friday. Chalmers\u2019s comments, summarised in an RBC note, came as senior officials from the Treasury and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) held a second urgent meeting with the Finance and Leasing Association (FLA) after an initial call last Friday. The FLA \u2013 which represents car lenders ranging from big banks such as Barclays to the finance arms of carmakers including Ford and Volkswagen \u2013 is concerned that the ruling could severely disrupt lending, particularly if firms end up on the hook for much larger compensation payments than had been anticipated from the FCA examination of the issue that began in January. That investigation, which only covers a practice banned in 2021 known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCA), was already expected to collectively cost the motor finance industry between \u00a38bn and \u00a313bn. That estimate includes \u00a31.1bn for Santander UK and \u00a3375m for Barclays, which ditched its motor finance business in 2019. Analysts estimate that the much-smaller Close Brothers, which has already been forced to cancel dividends and strengthen its balance sheet by \u00a3400m, could suffer a \u00a3252m blow. Its shares have plunged more than 37% since Friday. Lenders argue the court of appeal decision sets a higher bar for disclosing commission arrangements and securing customers\u2019 consent than they previously thought was necessary under FCA rules. Santander UK delayed the release of its quarterly results on Tuesday as it scrambled to review last week\u2019s ruling. The FLA is now calling on authorities to urgently extend an official pause on response times on complaints. The industry wants the pause to extend beyond DCA complaints, to ensure lenders are not penalised for taking longer to respond to new grievances over other types of commission related to motor finance. \u201cWe are considering this carefully and working at pace through the potential benefits and risks of doing so,\u201d the FCA chief executive Nikhil Rathi said in a speech on Tuesday. He added that the regulator was \u201cworking closely with the financial services sector, the Financial Ombudsman Service and the government to understand any wider consequences and further steps needed\u201d. More meetings are expected in the coming days. The FLA said \u201can expedited path to the supreme court would be a first step to restoring certainty\u201d. But there are growing concerns that the court of appeal judgment \u2013 which also ruled against specialist lender FirstRand \u2013 could expose lenders to complaints over commission payments across other financial products. Those fears prompted the banking industry body UK Finance to hold a call with a large number of its members on Tuesday to discuss the court ruling and its implications. The consumer champion Martin Lewis has said the ruling \u201chas the potential to shake up more than just car finance\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand this wasn\u2019t a ruling on the FCA rules, but on common law,\u201d he said in a post on his Money Saving Expert website. \u201cSo, unless overturned by the supreme court, it means ALL relevant commissions needed declaring this way, not just DCAs \u2013 a seismic change.\u201d The Treasury was contacted for comment."

The former president\u2019s big lie has distorted the views of millions of Americans, wrongly convincing many that the US economy is in bad shape. There\u2019s no denying that many Americans are struggling economically and that inflation was painfully high back in 2022, but inflation is far lower now, and most economists agree that our economy is strong. The unemployment rate is low, inflation is way down, economic growth is solid, and job growth has been remarkably strong. Indeed, the country has added nearly 18m jobs \u2013 a record \u2013 under the Biden-Harris administration. Not only that, median household income has climbed to $80,610, higher than it was in Trump\u2019s last year in office. \u201cIn the 35 years I\u2019ve been an economist, I\u2019ve rarely seen an economy performing as well as it is,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, said recently. \u201cI\u2019d give it an A+.\u201d But the US public, still upset about the surge in inflation several years ago, sees things very differently: 62% say the economy is in bad shape, while just 38% say it\u2019s in good shape, according to an October AP-NORC poll. The public holds this negative view even though there\u2019s been very good news for blue-collar workers: the US has added more than 700,000 factory jobs under the Biden-Harris administration, far more than during Trump\u2019s presidency, indeed more than under any president since the 1970s. There\u2019s also been good news for small businesses \u2013 a record 19m new business applications have been filed under Biden. There\u2019s also good news for the wealthy \u2013 the stock market has climbed to record levels, which is Wall Street\u2019s way of saying the economy is in excellent shape. Let\u2019s not forget that Trump warned that if Biden was elected president, the stock market would crash. Wrong again, Donald. Under Biden, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 36% higher than when Trump left office, and the S&amp;P 500 is 53% higher. Trump\u2019s repeated claim that today\u2019s economy is the worst ever shows either an appalling ignorance of history or an appalling contempt for the truth. The truth is that the economy was in far worse shape during Trump\u2019s last year in office, when the unemployment rate soared to 14.8% during the pandemic, compared with 4.1% now. Moreover, there were many other times when the economy was in worse shape \u2013 it was worse during the 2008 recession under George W Bush, far worse during the 1980-81 and 1974-75 recessions, and catastrophically worse during the Great Depression of the 1930s. When Trump tells his Maga crowds that today\u2019s economy is the worst ever, he\u2019s taking everyone for an idiot. The US economy has grown the fastest among major industrial nations since the pandemic began. Our economy has grown twice as fast as Canada\u2019s, three times as fast as France\u2019s and Japan\u2019s, and four times as fast as Britain\u2019s. Under Biden, the average unemployment rate has been lower than under any president since Lyndon Johnson. If Harris loses to Trump, historians and economists will long debate why she lost while Ronald Reagan was re-elected in a landslide in 1984 even though unemployment was far higher back then (7.2% versus 4.1% today), inflation was higher (4% versus 2.4% today), and the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rates were far higher (10% versus 5% today). One thing working for Reagan was that GDP growth was strong in 1984. Don\u2019t get me wrong, today\u2019s economy has serious problems. Millions of Americans are struggling, but it\u2019s wrong to blame Biden and Harris for that. I\u2019ve been writing about America\u2019s workers and economy for more than 40 years \u2013 from Reagan to Clinton to Trump to Biden \u2013 and under every president, millions of American have struggled economically. Trump makes believe that far more Americans are struggling now than ever before, but that\u2019s just not true. Take this important statistic: 11.1% of Americans currently fall below the poverty line. That\u2019s essentially the same percentage as under Trump and is only slightly above its lowest point in half a century. Many Americans say the economy is in poor shape mainly because of their lingering dismay about the high inflation from mid-2021 to mid-2023. But they may not know that wages have risen faster than inflation over the past two years and that real wages are higher than before the pandemic. Trump blames Biden and Harris for causing inflation, but they weren\u2019t the cause. The two main causes were the pandemic\u2019s closing factories and disrupting supply chains worldwide and Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, which increased energy and food prices. Americans complain that gas prices are higher, but that\u2019s Vladimir Putin\u2019s and Opec\u2019s fault, not Biden\u2019s or Harris\u2019s. US oil production has hit record levels. Housing affordability remains a big problem. Not only have housing prices soared, but high interest rates \u2013 which are finally coming down \u2013 have made it far too difficult for many Americans to buy a house. Again, the housing squeeze is not Biden\u2019s or Harris\u2019s fault; it was caused by a huge slowdown in housing production that began during the 2008 recession. It\u2019s unfortunate that Trump\u2019s dishonesty and deceit too often make us focus on his lies rather on something far more important: the future, and what a second Trump term would mean for the country. Many economists warn of disaster if Trump wins. They warn that his plan to impose tariffs or taxes on all imported goods will send inflation soaring and ignite a dangerous trade war that could cause a recession and throw millions out of work. Economists also warn that Trump\u2019s plans, including his plan to slash taxes on the wealthy and corporations, not only will increase the federal debt by a colossal $7.8tn, but could bankrupt the social security system and lead to a 33% across-the-board cut in social security benefits. No wonder 23 Nobel Prize-winning economists signed a recent letter calling Trump\u2019s economic agenda \u201ccounterproductive\u201d and warning that it \u201cwill lead to higher prices, larger deficits, and greater inequality\u201d. In contrast to Trump, Kamala Harris has specific plans to improve the economy and help Americans cope with high prices. She has pledged to build 3m new housing units to help bring down housing prices. She also plans to give $25,000 in down payment assistance to first-time homebuyers. To help with the high cost of raising a family, she has called for creating a $3,600 tax credit per child and $6,000 for newborns. Recognizing how expensive caregiving needs can be, she wants to create a trailblazing Medicare at Home program to help pay for care for ageing parents. Nobel-winning economists said Harris\u2019s economic agenda is \u201cvastly superior\u201d to Trump\u2019s and \u201cwill improve our nation\u2019s\u201d employment opportunities, health, investment and fairness. American voters have a clear choice. They can choose Harris\u2019s agenda, which promises a stronger, fairer economy, or Trump\u2019s agenda, which will bring a worse, less stable economy with higher prices and less fairness. Unlike Trump, I\u2019ll be honest and won\u2019t claim that his economic agenda will bring the worst economy ever, even though his agenda looks plenty dangerous.

            "date": "2024-10-01T08:00:26Z",
            "content": "Tim Walz and JD Vance, the US Democratic and Republican candidates for vice-president, will face off on Tuesday in what is likely to be the last debate showdown between the two parties\u2019 tickets before election day in exactly five weeks\u2019 time. The pair \u2013 who have had sharp words for each other at a distance \u2013 will engage in verbal combat in close quarters at a CBS-hosted event in New York, with the stakes raised by polling evidence that shows the contest between the two presidential nominees, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, poised on a knife edge. With Trump, the Republican nominee, continuing to refuse demands from Harris, his Democratic opponent, for a second presidential debate, much may ride on how the clash between Walz and Vance unfolds. The 90-minute duel will have added piquancy after Walz, the 60-year-old governor of Minnesota, memorably described Vance as \u201cweird\u201d while casting him as a key architect of Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for a radical shake-up of American government and society that would crack down intensely on immigration, vanquish LGBTQ+ and abortion rights, diminish environmental protections, overhaul financial policy and take aggressive action against China. Vance, 40, a senator for Ohio who has reinvented himself as a political attack dog for Trump despite disparaging him before entering politics, has hit back by depicting his opponent as a far-left liberal and accusing him of serially misrepresenting aspects of his military service in the national guard. He has also thrown the \u201cweird\u201d jibe back at Walz after the Democratic vice-presidential nominee said his children had been born with the help of IVF \u2013 which Vance once voted as a senator to oppose \u2013 before it emerged that he and his wife had used a different form of fertility treatment. A new poll released on Monday found that US voters specifically want the duo to debate immigration and economic policies \u2013 two of the top election issues this year. American voters may also be looking to hear from both sides on handling the unfolding devastation and aftermath of Hurricane Helene, with Trump and Harris visiting affected states this week. The potential for fireworks could be further raised by the fact that CBS\u2019s rules of engagement preclude its moderators, Norah O\u2019Donnell and Margaret Brennan, from factchecking the candidates in real time \u2013 as happened at last month\u2019s ABC debate between Harris and Trump in Philadelphia. Instead, the two men will be expected to fact-check each other. Vance enters the debate with arguably more to gain. Since his selection as Trump\u2019s running mate, his approval figures have been consistently in the negatives amid a string of disclosures over derogatory comments about childless women, whom he branded \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d. He has also drawn fire for his role in promoting a debunked rumour about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, eating pets, before later telling CNN \u2013 unapologetically \u2013 that he\u2019s willing to \u201ccreate\u201d stories for the purpose of calling attention to \u201cthe suffering of the American people\u201d. Amid the opprobrium, the Yale-educated Vance \u2013 who has prepared for the debate by holding rehearsals with a small team that includes the House Republican whip, Tom Emmer, playing the role of Walz, and his wife, Usha, as an adviser \u2013 has gained a high profile by embracing the role of articulator of Trump\u2019s fiercely anti-immigrant America-first populism. Walz, by contrast, has achieved more encouraging polling numbers yet has adopted a low-key posture since Harris chose him as her running mate after being promoted to the top of the Democratic ticket following Joe Biden\u2019s decision to step aside in July. He has given few media interviews and had settled for a lower profile following the acerbic attacks on Vance and other Maga Republicans that were first brought to national attention in the summer \u2013 and prompted Harris to select him. Walz, who projects an image of folksiness, has admitted to nervousness about Tuesday\u2019s debate while preparing with the help of Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary. He has voiced fears to associates that he may let Harris down and reportedly warned her when she chose him that he was a poor debater. While there is little evidence historically of vice-presidential debates affecting the outcome of presidential elections, past encounters have been notable for producing memorable moments and soundbites. In 2020, Harris herself was the source of one when she told Mike Pence \u2013 Vance\u2019s predecessor as Trump\u2019s running mate and, at the time, the vice president \u2013 after he interrupted her. She said: \u201cMr Vice-President, I\u2019m speaking.\u201d In the 1988 vice-presidential debate, Lloyd Bentsen, running mate to the Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, had a ready rejoinder when Dan Quayle, the Republican nominee behind George HW Bush, when quizzed, at age 41 \u2013 a year older than Vance \u2013 about his relative youth, responded by invoking John F Kennedy. \u201cSenator, I served with Jack Kennedy,\u201d replied Bentsen. \u201cI knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you\u2019re no Jack Kennedy.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-17T17:11:09Z",
            "content": "The European Central Bank has intervened to prevent a sharp slowdown in the eurozone economy with its first back-to-back interest rate cut since the euro crisis in 2011. With Germany on the brink of a recession and inflation tumbling across the 20 member single currency bloc, the ECB followed a reduction in the cost of borrowing at its previous meeting in September with a further 0.25 percentage point cut in its key deposit rate to 3.25%. Marking the third interest rate cut this year, the ECB\u2019s president, Christine Lagarde, said the fall in inflation had surprised the central bank and meant a cut was needed to ensure a soft landing for the eurozone economy. Figures out earlier on Thursday revealed annual prices growth in the eurozone had eased in September to 1.7%, down from 2.2% the previous month. Lagarde said there were clear signs from most measures of business and consumer activity that the economy was weakening. Growth in France is expected to wane after a bounce during the Olympics while Italy\u2019s better than expected recovery from the inflation shock of the last two years has petered out. Only Spain has shown a degree of resilience while interest rates have remained high, increasing by 0.8% in the second quarter of the year. Earlier this month, an measure of factory output in the eurozone \u2013 the HCOB Manufacturing PMI \u2013 fell to a nine-month low in September, adding to a downturn lasting more than two years. Lagarde said: \u201cThe latest data is all heading in the same direction, downwards, and points to more sluggish growth.\u201d She refused to indicate whether there would be further rate cuts, saying the central bank would remain dependent on the data before making further cuts at its next meeting in December. The ECB\u2019s move puts it two ahead of the Bank of England, which is widely forecast to cut the cost of borrowing in the UK by 0.25 percentage points from the current level of 5% when its monetary policy committee meets next month. In the US, the Federal Reserve has indicated it is also minded to trim rates in the coming months after instituting its first reduction last month \u2013 a half-point cut. Gold reached a record high just before Thursday\u2019s ECB announcement, hitting $2,688.82 (\u00a32,065.26) an ounce for the first time, lifted by forecasts of interest rate cuts around the world and uncertainty ahead of next month\u2019s US election. Announcing its decision, the ECB said the reduction in interest rates was based on \u201can updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission\u201d. It added: \u201cThe incoming information on inflation shows that the disinflationary process is well on track. The inflation outlook is also affected by recent downside surprises in indicators of economic activity.\u201d The deposit rate sets the return paid to eurozone banks when they make overnight deposits with the Eurosystem, the euro\u2019s monetary authority comprising the ECB and national central banks. \u201cThe trends in the real economy and inflation support the case for lower rates,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank. Joe Nellis, an economist at Cranfield University and an adviser to the financial consultancy MHA, said the ECB would be focused on promoting growth after a long period in which the cost of borrowing was kept high to combat inflation. \u201cUnlike the Bank of England, the ECB has a dual mandate, requiring it to take decisions to foster growth as well as control inflation. ECB policymakers will hope that this cut provides a boost to the German (and wider eurozone) economy, inspiring consumer spending, encouraging investment and ultimately stimulating the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the German economy likely to shrink for its second consecutive year, we can expect the ECB to cut rates by another 0.25% in December \u2013 this is a decision policymakers will feel they have to make if they are serious about catalysing growth in the eurozone\u2019s largest economy,\u201d he added."

            "date": "2024-10-15T15:20:27Z",
            "content": "Election certification is a mandatory duty, not discretionary, for county election officials in Georgia, a judge ruled on Tuesday, rejecting assertions made by a Republican elections official that elections board members could refuse to certify an election based on their suspicions of fraud or error. Julie Adams, a Republican member of the Fulton county board of registration and elections, brought the suit earlier this year after abstaining from a vote to certify the May primary election. The America First Policy Institute, a legal thinktank that was formed by former Donald Trump advisers in the wake of Trump\u2019s 2020 election loss to help lay legal groundwork for his potential return to office, joined the suit. Adams refused certification after claiming she had been denied access to a long list of elections documents. But Robert McBurney, Fulton county superior court judge, ruled that Adams was entitled to review documents quickly, but failing to provide those documents was not grounds for denying the certification of an election. \u201cIf election superintendents were, as plaintiff urges, free to play investigator, prosecutor, jury, and judge and so \u2013 because of a unilateral determination of error or fraud \u2013 refuse to certify election results, Georgia voters would be silenced,\u201d wrote McBurney in his ruling. \u201cOur Constitution and our election code do not allow for that to happen.\u201d The law uses the world \u201cshall\u201d, meaning certification is an order, McBurney wrote. \u201cTo users of common parlance, \u2018shall\u2019 connotes instruction or command: You shall not pass!\u201d he wrote. On Tuesday evening, McBurney temporarily halted a rule requiring clerks to hand-count the total number of ballots, according to a New York Times reporter who posted the document on social media. Hand-counting is \u201ctoo much, too late\u201d to implement for the 2024 election, the ruling reads. Adams is the regional coordinator for south-eastern states in the Election Integrity Network (EIN), a national group that has recruited election deniers to target local election offices. EIN was founded by Cleta Mitchell, a Trump ally who aided his efforts to overturn the election in Georgia and elsewhere. Adams\u2019s suit aimed to overturn longstanding Georgia precedent that the act of election certification is \u201cministerial\u201d, an administrative activity marking the end of an election. Elections disputes in Georgia have historically been managed through investigation by local district attorneys, the attorney general\u2019s office and ultimately in court. A bloc of Trump-aligned Republicans on Georgia\u2019s state elections board have rejected that interpretation of the law and implemented changes to election policies allowing for an undefined \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d by local elections officers before certification. Those changes are under challenge by Democratic leaders in separate court cases."

            "date": "2024-10-31T12:00:18Z",
            "content": "There could be a potential surge in political violence following the upcoming US election, and pro-Trump rightwing vigilante \u201cpoll watchers\u201d might surveil ballot drop boxes as Americans cast their votes, experts warned this week. A new report from the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE) highlighted alarming trends in online chatter, mirroring patterns observed in the lead-up to the 2020 election and the January 6 Capitol insurrection. Meanwhile, Princeton\u2019s Bridging Divides Initiative (BDI), issued a fact sheet with recommendations for dealing with conspiracy-minded monitoring groups like True the Vote, which spread false narratives in 2020 alleging that Democrats had sent paid \u201cmules\u201d to drop boxes with thousands of illegal votes in order to steal the election from Donald Trump. The twin reports highlighted risks to the elections and strategies for mitigating them, at a time when one man has been charged over armed attacks on a Democratic party office, and police in Oregon and Washington are investigating suspected arson attacks on ballot boxes in which some ballots were destroyed. The GPAHE report\u2019s warning is based on a rise in violent chatter on platforms known for hosting extremist content, including Telegram, Gab, Communities.win, and some communities across the decentralized social media network known as the Fediverse. The report shows that while the overall volume of messages on these platforms may be lower than in 2020, the sharp rise in violent rhetoric follows a pattern set ahead of the 2020 election. For example, in October, violent rhetoric related to election denialism increased by 317% on Telegram, 105% on Gab, 25% on communities.win, and 75% across a selection of Fediverse communities. The report says that across these platforms, users are indulging in violent rhetoric linked to election denialism. Some posts on Telegram this year have used election denialism to justify calls for violence, including calls for an \u201cinevitable civil war\u201d and urging users to \u201cshoot to kill any illegal voters\u201d. Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts On Gab, users have threatened perceived election fraudsters with treason charges, calling for \u201cfiring squads\u201d or \u201cthe rope\u201d, according to the report. It notes calls on the platform for \u201cpublic executions for all voter fraud\u201d and the shooting of elected officials labeled as \u201ctraitors\u201d, along with copious antisemitic conspiracy theories. Communities.win is a collection of forums that includes The_Donald, which was banned from Reddit for hate speech in 2020. According to the GPAHE report, users there have fantasized about a civil war in recent weeks, claiming that Democrats will not relinquish power and that a violent uprising is necessary for a \u201cGreat Awakening\u201d, a concept previously popularised by the QAnon conspiracy movement. In Fediverse communities, users have shared posts blaming the \u201cliberal media\u201d for inciting a \u201cwar\u201d and encouraging violence against perceived political opponents. GPAHE\u2019s report warns that \u201cignoring these worrying trends will only risk further acts of violence related to election denialism and anti-democratic sentiment\u201d. Heidi Beirich, GPAHE\u2019s co-founder, said: \u201cOur report shows that, when compared to violent election denial chatter in 2020, the numbers have been lower so far this year, but they are quickly rising as we approach election day.\u201d She added that \u201cunmoderated fringe sites\u201d were seeing \u201crising numbers of comments with violent political rhetoric \u201c and \u201cposts targeting election workers with violence, a sign that real world activity could escalate\u201d. BDI, meanwhile, warns against complacency after 2022, when vigilante poll watchers mostly stayed away from drop boxes, despite months of conspiracy-minded chatter about Democrats and the \u201cdeep state\u201d stealing mid-term elections from Republicans. According to the fact sheet, BDI data shows that in 2022, there were 44 incidents of physical monitoring at fewer than 20 drop box locations out of an estimated 13,000 active sites nationwide. That is, only 0.1% of drop boxes around the country were subject to monitoring activity. It warns, however, that threats of monitoring activity have resurfaced online during the 2024 campaign, and states including Arizona and Wisconsin have seen legal decisions that reduce restrictions on vigilante monitoring, opening the way for possible voter intimidation. The Guardian reported this week on an Arizona poll-watching group which has been casting doubt on the election result ahead of time, with members\u2019 paranoia being fueled by rightwing influencers and media outlets. The fact sheet makes a series of recommendations to poll workers ahead of the vote on ways to head off political violence, including de-escalation techniques; research to identify threats; communicating accurate information on elections; and community outreach and dialogue on election security. The BDI report says: \u201cThese steps can improve the US political violence early warning infrastructure and help prevent the amplification of rumors, false claims, and unfounded threat messaging aimed at suppressing voter turnout in targeted communities\u201d."

            "date": "2024-10-30T16:00:06Z",
            "content": "The conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was stolen is now mainstream on the right. Believers are undeterred by the fact that the election was free and fair and the lack of evidence of fraud. Those who seek to correct the misinformation become targets of Donald Trump and his allies. As Trump runs for re-election, he has laid the groundwork to make a bevy of stolen election claims after 5 November, many of which are retreads of those made in 2020 or other elections. They include the false claim that non-citizens are voting in broad numbers, attacks on the voting and counting process, misunderstandings of how elections work and opportunism when human errors occur. If Trump wins, these lies could be used to target down-ballot races. If Trump loses, election lies could reach levels seen in 2020 \u2013 or beyond. Trump has not committed to accepting the results of the 2024 election. \u201cIf I lose \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s possible. Because they cheat. That\u2019s the only way we\u2019re gonna lose, because they cheat,\u201d Trump said during a rally in September. Here is a rundown of some of the most pervasive myths about elections, how they are run and who votes in them. * * * Are non-citizens voting en masse? Republicans, led by Trump and his allies, have repeatedly claimed without evidence that non-citizens are voting en masse in US elections. It is illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections. States verify citizenship, and voting illegally could lead to deportation. Still, people such as Elon Musk have elevated these falsehoods, claiming that Democrats are trying to \u201cimport voters\u201d. There is no evidence that non-citizens are voting, or even registering to vote, in significant numbers. Republicans have tried to get around that lack of evidence by relying on gut feelings. \u201cWe all know \u2013 intuitively \u2013 that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections. But it\u2019s not been something that is easily provable,\u201d the House speaker, Mike Johnson, said as he pushed for legislation to address the non-problem. In the run-up to November, some states have sought to purge their voter rolls of potential non-citizens, though these purges have run into legal trouble for discriminating against a group of voters or for attempting to remove voters within 90 days of an election, which is not legal. And the purges have ensnared eligible voters, both naturalized citizens and US-born ones. The Republican National Committee has filed lawsuits in some states claiming the voter rolls were not maintained and could contain non-citizens, though experts say the attacks on voter rolls appear more designed for publicity purposes than serious legal concerns. * * * Are voting machines adding fake votes? And will hand counting save us? Since the 2020 election, claims have continued to spread that machines used to tabulate votes somehow injected ballots in favor of Democrats, though no proof has been offered to support these claims. These attacks may well emerge again in 2024. Already, an account on X with nearly 250,000 followers wrote that Democrats were going to steal the election by printing \u201cMILLIONS of fake ballots\u201d and then unloading \u201cPALLETS of BALLOTS and run them through the machines\u201d. The post was viewed more than 4m times. Repeated attacks on voting machines have led the companies that make them, including Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic, to file lawsuits against media outlets that spread these lies, resulting in settlements against the outlets, including one for $787.5m against Fox News. In some places, there has been a push for hand-counting ballots \u2013 a costlier, slower and less accurate method of tabulation. A group of hand-count supporters has toured the country trying to get local jurisdictions to adopt the practice, with limited success in some smaller areas. A rule change in Georgia to hand-count ballots was blocked by a judge there. * * * What is \u2018certification\u2019, and why are some local officials blocking it? A key way election deniers could seek to overturn results in November is through the certification process. In US elections, local elections officials oversee the counting of ballots, often referred to as the canvass. County or town elected officials then sign off on those results in what is known as a certification. The role of these county or town officials is to acknowledge the count, not act as a referee. This function is mandatory, not discretionary. Across the country, there have been a few instances of officials refusing to certify results. In Georgia, some election officials refused to certify results in this year\u2019s presidential primary. In Cochise county, Arizona, two Republican county supervisors initially refused to certify, requiring a court to order them to do so, after which one of the two reversed her vote. Those supervisors were criminally charged by the state\u2019s Democratic attorney general in part to deter others from trying a similar stunt. Delaying a certification could disenfranchise voters whose elected officials refused to acknowledge their votes were cast. Courts have uniformly responded to force certification in the instances where it was refused or delayed since 2020, but these delays undermine the electoral process and can be costly. * * * Are Democrats cheating with overseas voters? Trump and rightwing media, including Gateway Pundit, a site that is particularly prolific in the realm of election misinformation, have claimed that Democrats are trying to cheat by getting overseas US citizens to vote. But this is legal. Nearly 3 million people who live abroad, including US military members and their families, are eligible to vote via the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. Democrats have estimated a much higher number, saying in a memo that 9 million Americans abroad could be eligible to vote. This set off rumors that Democrats were planning to fraudulently register people, and that this could become an avenue for foreign interference in elections. The Center for an Informed Public at the University of Washington broke down how the rumor spread and debunked it. (According to the University of Washington, the Democrats\u2019 claim of 9 million eligible voters was \u201cerroneous\u201d.) * * * Voting by mail/early voting/voting drop boxes: does it involve fraud? Trump and his allies have often attacked voting by mail, saying it isn\u2019t secure. They have also attacked drop boxes that allow voters to deposit their ballots quickly and easily. Some have pushed for one day of voting, only in person, which would greatly curtail voter access. In Arizona in 2022, some activists camped out at drop boxes, some armed or in tactical gear, to monitor people dropping off ballots, until the courts curtailed the practice. But this year, Trump and the Republican party have changed course and encouraged their voters to turn out early and cast ballots by mail if it\u2019s their preference, a sign that they were losing votes by discouraging these practices. Still, if Trump loses, he could again claim that voting by mail, the use of drop boxes or early voting in general are compromised by fraud. * * * Human errors and unexpected controversies Every election sees human errors, most of which do not affect people\u2019s ability to vote or vote totals. But these errors can become sources of misinformation, as can benign circumstances that are spun into controversies. If recent history is any precedent, prepare for some kind of pen debacle. In 2020, and to a lesser extent in the 2022 midterms, the type of pens given out to voters in Maricopa county, Arizona, figured in a number of conspiracies. Dubbed \u201cSharpiegate\u201d in 2020, the use of Sharpies did not affect people\u2019s votes, though some on the right spread this claim because the markers can bleed through and leave a mark on the other side of a two-sided ballot. (This doesn\u2019t affect how a vote is read by a tabulator.) In 2022, the county switched to a different felt-tip pen, but for some, it didn\u2019t matter: they still encouraged voters not to use the county-provided pens, even though those pens were best for the printers and prevented ink from gumming up machines. Legitimate errors can also lead to outsized criticism. In Minnesota this month, the hatch of a ballot transport van was left open and unattended, with ballots in it, for about 10 minutes. The ballots were undisturbed, security footage showed, but a photo of the open van spread widely, causing controversy. The Minnesota secretary of state, Scott Simon, a Democrat, said the incident was \u201cinexcusable and totally unacceptable\u201d, and his office sent a bulletin out to local elections officials to remind them to double down on security, he said. \u201cAll it takes is one sloppy, inattentive person to call into question the really good and conscientious work of thousands and thousands of people,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cSo it\u2019s frustrating to see, but we\u2019re trying to make it a teachable moment in our office.\u201d * * * \u2018Delays\u2019 and recounts: usually not something to worry about Vote counting takes time. US elections are complex \u2013 in some places, ballots can run longer than a page, with voters weighing in on races from president down to school boards. Verifying signatures on mail-in ballots, used widely in some states, can take days. In a fast-paced society, the slow pace of counting accurately can surely be frustrating. And in places where elections are especially close, all eyes will be watching as the vote-counting continues well beyond election day. Claims might emerge about how these slow counts are somehow indicative of fraud. This could be especially true in Arizona, which has close races and particularly large counties. Lawmakers there have also altered the recount threshold since the 2020 election \u2013 now, an automatic recount is triggered if a race is within 0.5%, up from 0.1%. This led to several recounts in the 2022 midterms, including for the state attorney general. Depending on how close the presidential race or other key matchups are, these recounts could become a source for misinformation. Republicans have pressed for faster results as well as for more checks on the voting process, two ideas that are frequently at odds. Trump has used the window between the end of voting and the finalization of results to declare victory in the past. In 2020, he planned in advance to call himself the winner even if it wasn\u2019t clear he actually was, Axios reported at the time. As votes are counted, one candidate may replace another in the lead. This is not evidence that ballots have somehow been injected, as has sometimes been alleged. It is rather the function of how counting works: as more ballots are tabulated, totals change."

            "date": "2024-10-18T14:00:52Z",
            "content": "Two court rulings in Georgia over the last week have beaten back efforts by Republican activists to empower political challenges to November\u2019s election results, though the expected legal fight over the election is far from concluded. Robert McBurney, a Fulton county superior court judge, ruled on Tuesday that elections officials had a legal obligation to certify an election, leaving disputes over results and allegations of misconduct to investigation by local district attorneys\u2019 offices. The ruling rejected the assertion of Trump-aligned attorneys working with Julie Adams, a Republican appointee to the Fulton election board, that board members could exercise their discretion in certification. A day later, another Fulton county superior court judge, Thomas Cox, issued a stern order after a short hearing, invalidating seven rules made by Georgia\u2019s state election board this year. One of the invalidated rules required ballots to be hand-counted on election night. A second allowed elections officials to conduct a poorly defined \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d into discrepancies before issuing a certification. And a third would have required elections officials to turn over volumes of documents to board members for review before certification. The rules, passed by a three-person bloc of Trump-aligned members on the five-person board, were \u201cunsupported by Georgia\u2019s Election Code and are in fact contrary to the Election Code\u201d, according to the ruling, which added that the state election board lacked the authority to create rules that go beyond state law. The ruling sharply limits the power of the state election board to make further rules. The Georgia Republican party said it would appeal the ruling, while voting rights groups hailed the victory. \u201cStriking down the state election board\u2019s hand-count and other rules is a major win for voters, election integrity and democracy as a whole,\u201d Nichola Hines, president of the League of Women Voters of Georgia, a plaintiff in the suit challenging the state election board, said in a statement. \u201cThese rules were introduced with bad intentions and aimed at causing chaos in Georgia\u2019s secure elections process. The League remains committed to standing up for Georgia voters every step of the way.\u201d Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts The state election board\u2019s rule-making put it at odds with many county elections directors, voting rights advocates and the attorney general\u2019s office, which advised the board that the rules it was considering would probably be found unconstitutional. Janelle King, one of the three board members Trump praised as being \u201cpit bulls for honesty, transparency and victory\u201d at an Atlanta rally earlier this year, defended the board\u2019s actions in an interview with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on its Politically Georgia podcast on Thursday. \u201cI feel like the benefit in all of this is that, I hope people see that has never been and isn\u2019t a partisan issue,\u201d she said. \u201cA Republican brought this case against us,\u201d she added, referring to Scot Turner, a retired Georgia state representative who was a plaintiff suing the board. With regard to the hand-counting of ballots, King said that the board\u2019s rule-making was meant to ensure an accurate vote count. \u201cThis is not saying anything sinister is going on,\u201d King said. \u201cWe keep talking about human error. If we know there\u2019s going to be human error, then it\u2019s important for us to create rules that are surrounded by laws that allow us to plug that hole. That\u2019s what I thought I was doing and what I will continue to do.\u201d Voting rights organizations disagree with her characterization of the board\u2019s rule-making. \u201cThe 11th-hour rules adopted by the state election board only serve to cause disruption to the electoral process and confusion for voters,\u201d Campaign Legal Center\u2019s voting advocacy and partnerships director, Jonathan Diaz, said. \u201cWe are glad one state court has agreed that the hand-count rule cannot go into effect for the upcoming election and we encourage other courts to follow suit.\u201d The board itself is under fire by Democratic lawmakers, who see its members as partisan in ways that may violate the law. A suit by the Georgia state senator Nabilah Islam-Parkes, former Fulton elections board chair Cathy Woolard and state senator-elect Randall Mangham sought to force Governor Brian Kemp to investigate the board for conflicts of interest and potentially remove some of its members. Judge Ural Glanville dismissed the suit earlier this month, ruling that the Democrats could not simply label their accusations \u201cformal charges\u201d and compel the governor to act. The three have appealed the ruling, Mangham said. \u201cLook, these people clearly have conflicts of interest and ethical violations and are intentionally violating the law,\u201d Mangham said. He referred to comments by one state board member, Rick Jeffares, who suggested his interest in becoming a regional Environmental Protection Agency director to a former Trump campaign aide. \u201cThis atmosphere is coming from a rogue elections board. Just a few rogue people. These people who are lining up for a job in the new administration \u2026 It\u2019s like an umpire is lobbying for a job on the team and can then go and call a play fairly. And then you don\u2019t want to investigate it?\u201d The last-minute rule changes struck down by Georgia judges would never have happened under the provisions of the Voting Rights Act struck down by the US supreme court, Mangham said. \u201cThe preclearance requirement would keep all of this from coming.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-09T04:00:06Z",
            "content": "Mozambicans go to the polls on Wednesday in elections that the ruling Frelimo party is expected to win easily, even as an outsider candidate is shaking up the presidential race and winning over young voters in a country where the median age is just 17. Frelimo has ruled the southern African country since the end of Portuguese colonial rule in 1975. For the first time, it is fielding a presidential candidate born after independence, Daniel Chapo, a provincial governor who was relatively unknown until being picked in May as the candidate to succeed the outgoing president, Filipe Nyusi. Frelimo\u2019s traditional political rival is the Renamo party, its opponent in a civil war that lasted from 1977 to 1992 and cost an estimated 1 million lives. But Ven\u00e2ncio Mondlane, who left Renamo in June to run as an independent in the presidential election after failing to oust its leader, Ossufo Momade, has been winning over young voters. Analysts say they do not expect Frelimo to relinquish its grip on power, though, having made campaigning and voter registration difficult for its opponents. \u201cThe election is never difficult for an authoritarian regime,\u201d said Borges Nhamirre, a researcher at the Institute for Security Studies, a South African thinktank. \u201cNo matter what happens, the final result doesn\u2019t depend on the voters\u2019 will.\u201d Mondlane, whose charismatic speeches at late-night rallies have drawn passionate crowds around the country, has pushed other candidates to use social media more, Nhamirre said, and to pledge to renegotiate contracts in the natural gas and mining sectors. \u201cMondlane is a gamechanger \u2026 If this was a fair and free election, at least Mondlane would be the second [placed] candidate,\u201d he said. Frelimo could rig the election to ensure Renamo\u2019s Momade comes second, though, Nhamirre added, to neuter Mondlane and stop him inspiring other outsider politicians. Mozambique is the world\u2019s eighth poorest country, according to the World Bank, with a GDP per capita of just $608. It is rich in natural resources such as coal and rubies, but its efforts to exploit huge natural gas reserves have been stymied by an Islamic State-linked insurgency in Cabo Delgado, its north-eastern province. Its economy was devastated when $2bn in corrupt, hidden \u201ctuna bond\u201d loans \u2013 named as the debt was ostensibly taken out to fund a state fishing fleet and maritime security \u2013 were revealed in 2016, leading the International Monetary Fund, countries and other international financiers to pull funding. As in many other African countries with booming populations, Mozambique\u2019s educated urban youth are increasingly dissatisfied with the status quo. However, analysts say a playing field that is far from level makes a repeat of the 2019 presidential election likely, when Nyusi won 73% of the vote and Momade just 22%. Anne Pitcher, a politics professor at the University of Michigan, said: \u201cThey\u2019ve already done the rigging before the election. They\u2019ve made it difficult for people to register to vote. In the areas where they are strong, they then make sure that they do a more comprehensive registration.\u201d The Public Integrity Center, an NGO, said in June there were almost 879,000 fake voters out of 17 million people registered to vote. It claimed a third of all registered voters in Gaza, a southern province and Frelimo stronghold, were so-called ghost voters. Meanwhile, Mondlane\u2019s candidacy may have excited many young Mozambicans but it has also divided the opposition, said D\u00e9rcio Alfazema, an independent political analyst. \u201cPeople are not very satisfied with the country\u2019s situation and many voters will vote against Frelimo,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think these votes will be enough to remove Frelimo from power.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-22T10:00:14Z",
            "content": "Some have called Hurricanes Helene and Milton an October surprise. Yet such disasters are now dispiritingly predictable. In their wake, pundits have asked whether and how the storms \u2013 which happened to hit some key swing states \u2013 could impact a presidential election shaping up to be decided by razor-thin margins. There\u2019s practical concerns, like whether some affected voters will physically be able to cast their ballots. And then there\u2019s a political question: Will the fact that the climate crisis, which is exacerbated these hurricanes, raise the importance of that issue? Or will that be counterbalanced by those who have become convinced the government engineered these disasters to suppress electoral power? Believe it or not, the answer could rest on the shoulders of your local weather reporter. Such an unlikely hero went viral earlier this month when John Morales, a venerable meteorologist in Miami, became visibly emotional on air during one of his reports on Milton. His voice choking, he offered an ominous assessment of the hurricane\u2019s strength: \u201cThis is just horrific.\u201d That sincerity and urgency garnered the clip nearly 2m views. The resonance of Morales\u2019s appearance proves that combining deep expertise, hard-earned credibility and a willingness to be vulnerable could provide a roadmap \u2013 or a forecast \u2013 for climate reporting to remain relevant and impactful despite the headwinds. Climate change presents the classic political conundrum of a (literally) glacial catastrophe demanding swift action. To avert the worst effects, the investments required \u2013 from clean energy to flood-proof infrastructure \u2013 would total in the trillions, but voters tend to be wary of making such outlays until the worst has already happened. Polling bears out this \u201cshort-termism.\u201d Americans have gone from climate skeptics to climate curious, with 54% saying they consider it a major threat. And yet when it comes time to rank their top issues heading into election day, the public demurs, placing climate change second to last on their list of priorities. Of course, the repeat champion remains the economy \u2013 never mind that with smart policies, combating the climate crisis could be a lifesaver and a job creator. Despite the popular narrative, global heating does have short-term consequences, namely extreme weather events like Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Over the past three decades, extreme weather has caused $48bn in crop damage, $339bn in property damage and killed nearly 14,000 people. And the intensity of that damage has been exacerbated by rising temperatures. Amid these catastrophes, reeling residents turn to local news broadcasts for live updates, with ratings sometimes spiking by 80% during hurricanes. In such moments, meteorologists are perfectly positioned to help viewers connect short-term extreme weather with long-term climate change \u2013 having forged a deep connection with a wide audience all year round. Republicans and Democrats alike rank the Weather Channel as their most trusted news source. And meteorologists remain among the most trusted sources regarding global heating in communities nationwide, even though trust in the media generally continues to plummet. To be sure, weathercasters haven\u2019t been completely unscathed by today\u2019s hyper-fragmented, ultra-polarized media landscape; they, along with Fema workers, have had to endure harassment and death threats directly tied to inflammatory disinformation. But such encounters, while serious, remain exceptional. Local meteorologists are still the most effective and credible mass communicators we have \u2013 better positioned than almost anyone to persuade on climate, if armed with the right message. Enter Climate Central, a nonprofit which creates weekly climate content for meteorologists and weather reporters tailored to their specific communities. The organization empowers local journalists to make climate change personal, equipping partners in 95% of American media markets with the science, big data and targeted graphics they need to help audiences understand what\u2019s happening in their own backyards \u2013 and, critically, what can be done about it. Covering Climate Now has taken this approach globally. Co-founded by the Nation, the Guardian and the Columbia Journalism Review, CCN provides local journalists worldwide with climate reporting resources, from training to targeted investigations of issues like extreme drought or big oil. The journalists they support have a collective audience of 2 billion people in 60 countries. But the basic strategy remains the same no matter the continent, as described in a recent column in the Nation by CCN co-founder Mark Hertsgaard: \u201cWeathercasters talk their viewers through scary times by calmly providing practical, life-saving information.\u201d If you want proof of its efficacy, look no further than John Morales, a longtime CCN colleague. These efforts bring the media closer to treating climate change like it does every other issue, providing macro context for micro events in the simplest terms possible. The Dow Jones industrial average offers readers a digestible daily snapshot of the American stock market. Its ticker tape runs endlessly on CNBC and in Times Square. Why not cover extreme weather with the same unswerving attention? At the very least, why not dedicate 30 seconds of every evening newscast to the latest movement on the US climate extremes index? If we want to curb climate change\u2019s effect on our planet, it might just start with weather reporters bringing the issue down to earth.

            "date": "2024-10-30T10:23:19Z",
            "content": "Like a lot of people, Richard Seymour, 47, was trying to quietly ignore the climate crisis and get on with his life. As a prolific Marxist intellectual, this meant industriously writing about a range of subjects: the Iraq war, neoliberalism, the class struggle. The climate crisis could wait until after the revolution. Besides, he didn\u2019t have the expertise or emotional capacity for it. But in 2015 that changed. Walking in a local park on Christmas Day, he couldn\u2019t ignore how noticeably warm it was. He started to think about not just what has already been lost but what global heating means for the losses to come. \u201cSome sort of defence just went down,\u201d he says, \u201cand I experienced a preliminary bit of climate mourning.\u201d Seymour grew up in a small town in Northern Ireland surrounded by farmland, rivers and woodland but for years he\u2019d been flexing what he calls a \u201chyper urban\u201d attitude \u2013 it was in New York and Paris where the labour movement historically flourished and so it was in those kinds of environments that he felt he and his politics most belonged. But on that winter\u2019s day, he remembered \u201cgrowing up in nature and having an emotional attachment to it\u201d \u2013 from the Mourne Mountains to the Giant\u2019s Causeway. \u201cIt struck me that although things will go on in a way, nothing like that will ever exist again, it\u2019s gone \u2026 And the things that I enjoy now, you know, they\u2019re going to go too.\u201d Seymour set about reading all he could, from oceanography to evolutionary theory. Now he is, arguably, one of the UK\u2019s foremost thinkers on the politics of climate breakdown and nature loss. In his regular Patreon and podcast appearances, Seymour \u2013 who is clearly something of a polymath \u2013 effortlessly joins the dots between environmental collapse, the rise of the far right and the role our desires play in a crumbling world, all while retaining his Marxist roots. As the Swedish scholar Andreas Malm asks on the front cover of Seymour\u2019s new book, Disaster Nationalism: The Downfall of Liberal Civilization, \u201cWhat thinker would you bring to an Earth on fire? You would not want to leave Richard Seymour at home.\u201d Our emotional responses to the world around us is one of the things that interests Seymour most. When we meet in the British Library to talk about his latest work, it\u2019s this theme we keep circling back to. Comparing the success of the far right in India, Brazil and the US (among other places), Seymour argues that most explanations for their rise are insufficient. What we\u2019re seeing is \u201ctoo consistent over time and too global, to be explained by local factors such as the backlash of a fading white supremacy, or Russian troll farms, or \u2018bad actors\u2019 spreading disinformation,\u201d he writes. These movements also don\u2019t have the hallmarks of historical fascism. \u201cTheir immediate objective is not the overthrow of electoral democracy,\u201d Seymour observes, but \u201ca constitutional rupture breaking with all humane and \u2018woke\u2019 constraints on the exercise of power.\u201d While the old establishment decomposes, the far right conjures up apocalyptic images \u2013 \u201cthe great replacement\u201d, \u201cIslamisation\u201d, \u201cChinese-style communism\u201d \u2013 to animate potential supporters. This is not yet a distinct form of fascism; instead, it is what Seymour calls \u201cdisaster nationalism\u201d. An examination of the far right globally, Disaster Nationalism isn\u2019t strictly about the climate crisis. But they are clearly connected. While disaster-laden fantasies capture imaginations, the environmental crisis lurks in the background. Seymour wants to interrogate this: why is fictional collapse so appealing, so exhilarating, when we live in a world of already existing, real disasters? If people are miserable, insecure and humiliated, the far right offers a specific remedy in disaster nationalism, Seymour argues. \u201cIt offers the balm, not just of vengeance, but of a sort of violent reset which restores the traditional consolations of family, race, religion and nationhood, including the chance to humiliate others.\u201d Applying a psychoanalytic lens, as the American writer Tad DeLay does too, Seymour avoids commonplace and often sympathy-tinged characterisations of the far right as a cry of the working class (the \u201cleft behind\u201d). The economy matters somewhat \u2013 he says a trajectory of decline fuels many middle-class people\u2019s radicalisation to the right \u2013 but the roots of these movements often aren\u2019t proletarian. \u201cAll of these formations start off with a fairly middle-class voter base,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly true of Bolsonaro, Duterte and Modi, and after a term in office, they have begun to build a real cross-class coalition, which is incredible.\u201d Anyone familiar with Seymour\u2019s writing will know that he takes racism, sexism and transphobia seriously. When we talk, he speaks about these forms of bigotry with the same sophistication he brings to his writing and manages to do so while forgoing one of the other mainstream explanations of the far right\u2019s rise, where voters are dismissed as gullible idiots who need to be shown the error of their ways \u2013 and of their information sources. \u201cIf I agree to fantasise about gruesome, erotically charged scenarios for whose reality I\u2019ve been given no good evidence, I am not simply lacking \u2018critical skills\u2019 or \u2018media literacy\u2019: the fantasy is doing something for me. It is staging something that I want, even if I don\u2019t want to want it. And if that fantasy is then adopted by numerous others, for no good reason, then the wish obviously isn\u2019t reducible to personal psychopathology but is rooted in a shared social condition,\u201d he writes in Disaster Nationalism. And that shared social condition is crucially affected and shaped by climate breakdown. The 2020 Oregon wildfires are illustrative, sweeping through the western US state after a series of chronic disasters: the credit crunch, skyrocketing rural poverty, alcoholism, suicide above the norm and a breakdown of local news, leaving Facebook and Nextdoor to fill the void. But when mostly white, rural, conservative Christians see the fires, it\u2019s not climate change or capitalism they blame. Spontaneously \u2013 not orchestrated by any one person or politician \u2013 it is the conspiracies they\u2019ve heard that make the most sense of something so large and so destructive: Antifa, doing the bidding of the Democrats whose aim is to usher in communism, are to blame, wanting to kill people like them to remake America. Ideas like these spread like a contagion and the threshold for their uptake isn\u2019t necessarily that high. As the fires rage, people refuse to leave, Seymour notes, so they can physically protect where they live from the arsonists they believe are behind all of this. Ecological disaster transforms into disaster created by human evil; the climate crisis turns into a crisis of interpersonal rivalry, aggression and victimhood. The destruction of the planet creates the structural conditions for these ideas but it wouldn\u2019t be possible if they weren\u2019t already circulating, Seymour argues. And he\u2019s clear on why they\u2019re so effective. \u201cYou can\u2019t shoot climate change, you can\u2019t take it to court, the same thing with capitalism. These are big, abstract forces, and you feel kind of hopeless against them,\u201d he says. It\u2019s far more attractive, exciting even, to \u201cattack a personalised enemy\u201d. All of us are susceptible to this, Seymour maintains \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s jackboots for all of us\u201d, he reminds me at the end of our interview \u2013 albeit not equally. I ask him about the left\u2019s attempts to try a similar tactic and personify capitalism \u2013 for example, Bernie Sanders\u2019 crusade against billionaires. He says they\u2019ve had some success but it\u2019s not so easy to play the far right at their own game. The ultra-rich live on another planet \u2013 you might see Jeff Bezos on TV, but you\u2019re never going to meet him. Whereas people feel they know immigrants or Muslims and, if you read the news, you\u2019ll be offered up these people as deviants every single day, Seymour points out. The left has also been derailed by the idea that self-interest exhaustively explains how people behave. \u201cI am not suggesting that bread-and-butter politics is superfluous. It will help,\u201d he writes \u201cwe do need bread and butter. We even like it. But we don\u2019t love it. And the things we do love often don\u2019t give us any material benefit whatever. You might love your children, for example, but it isn\u2019t because they increase your income and free time.\u201d Hope-scolds, as he calls them, miss the point when they caution that greens who doom-monger about the state of the world will demotivate people; recognising the end may be imminent can have the opposite impact, he argues. \u201cPeople can be affected by climate disasters and draw wildly varying conclusions from it. But when they find other people who have the same response and who want to do something about it, they bond over it,\u201d he explains. \u201cToo often, leftist talk about \u2018organisation\u2019 is abstract, making it sound like the issue is one of correct ideas and procedures,\u201d he says. Instead, it should mean creating a form of life where people need each other. We already see this in unions, where people might join for better wages but end up striking to defend their comrades, even if they lose pay. Seymour experiences this solidarity when he volunteers at his local church, which supports people who are homeless, many of whom are refugees. \u201cI\u2019m surrounded by people who do this all the time \u2026 they bring in stuff that they\u2019ve made, they bring in stuff they\u2019ve bought, they give up their free time for other people, no questions asked. The rule is \u2026 [you have to show] unconditional love for whoever walks in the door\u201d - no matter who they are or what they\u2019ve done. This might all sound a bit too \u201cuniversal peace and brotherhood\u201d, he acknowledges, while still retaining his sardonic edge. But \u201cif you imagine that you live in a planet where everything alive around you is purposive and has an intentional relationship to you and the rest of the world \u2026 I think that motivates better behaviour.\u201d For Seymour, then, comradeship isn\u2019t just between humans, but between species and the living world. This is surely the bedrock of not just socialism, but eco socialism. To better understand this and what we\u2019re losing, it makes more sense to talk about mass extinction than just climate change, he tells me. \u201cIt pertains to the destruction and decay and etiolation of life across the board and all the evidence suggests we\u2019re in what some call the end \u2013 Holocene mass extinction.\u201d And extinctions reveal all our unacknowledged dependencies; we need plants and other animals. We, human beings, do not sit at the top of a grand hierarchy. Continuing as we are, exploiting other animals and the rest of nature, is unsustainable. \u201cIf you want a less fancy way of putting it: love,\u201d says Seymour. This isn\u2019t necessarily where all Marxists might end up but he adds, \u201cif we\u2019re talking about socialism, what else are we talking about?\u201d \u2022 Disaster Nationalism by Richard Seymour (Verso Books, \u00a320).

She discusses it with family and friends because of the intensity of hurricanes like Milton and Helene, which have ravaged the southern US, she says. \u201cIt just seems like it\u2019s affecting more people every day.\u201d That\u2019s one reason why she is glad that UC San Diego has implemented an innovative graduation requirement for students starting this autumn: a course in climate change. Courses must cover at least 30% climate-related content and address two of four areas, including scientific foundations, human impacts, mitigation strategies and project-based learning. About 7,000 students from the class of 2028 will be affected this year. \u201cThe most important thing is that UC San Diego wants to make sure we\u2019re preparing students for the future that they really will encounter,\u201d says Sarah Gille, a physical oceanographer at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who was part of the committee to create the new plan. The requirement won\u2019t add any time to a student\u2019s graduation schedule \u2013 it\u2019s designed to be integrated into existing classwork. Forty one-quarter courses meet the goal, including \u201cThe Astronomy of Climate Change\u201d, \u201cGender and Climate Justice\u201d, \u201cIndigenous Approaches to Climate Change\u201d and \u201cEnvironmentalism in Arts and Media\u201d. Many of the classes that fall under the climate requirement overlap with courses that focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, the school says. Gille says students are positive about the requirement, which aims to prepare them for future climate-related policies and career opportunities. \u201cWe\u2019re acutely aware as a society of how the climate is changing and how scary that can be, and that probably means that we need to implement some changes in how we do things,\u201d says Gille. \u201cIf they\u2019re thinking about the future, they need to be prepared for what the future might bring.\u201d That could mean new opportunities in climate-adjacent fields such as carbon accounting or civil engineering with a climate focus. Gille says she can stand in front of a class and talk about what the world might look like in 50 or 100 years in terms of temperature increase or sea level rise \u2013 \u201ca pretty demoralizing lesson\u201d \u2013 but when she ties it to strategic decisions students can make about their own lives, and how to pursue opportunities in the future, \u201cit can become an empowering lesson too\u201d. The move mirrors a larger sentiment in society. According to a Marist poll this year, 85% of gen Z is very or somewhat concerned about the climate crisis. They are more likely to believe the climate crisis is caused \u201cmostly by human activity\u201d than any other generation. And states from California to Connecticut and New Jersey are now requiring that kids learn about the climate crisis in grade school classrooms. Arizona State University has also implemented a new sustainability requirement for graduation this year. Universities such as Columbia, Harvard and Stanford are taking the climate focus a step further and have created entire schools devoted to the issue. Marcello Ametrano, a communications major and marine science minor, says that even as a non-science student, he\u2019s interested in keeping up to date on the latest science. \u201cIt\u2019s really opening my eyes to a lot of what\u2019s going on right now, especially with Hurricane Milton, and why it\u2019s so devastating,\u201d he says. Understanding the oceans is key: \u201cThe ocean is kind of saving us from it being so much worse, because it absorbs so much carbon dioxide. So it\u2019s really important to understand the ocean because it directly relates to climate change and essentially what\u2019s going on right now in Florida.\u201d A wider rollout of climate change courses for graduation is possible across the vast, statewide University of California system, but the school is first focusing on its own plan. \u201cThe important thing for UC San Diego was to do what made sense for our campus and to see how this requirement is adopted,\u201d Gille says. \u201cIf we can do something that\u2019s bigger, we can potentially create a generation of college graduates who are better prepared for the future.\u201d"

The video below shows the moment a woman and a dog were rescued from a property in Valencia If you\u2019re just joining our coverage this afternoon, here\u2019s a brief look at developments in Spain today. Tap the link in each bullet point to take a look back at previous posts The number of people killed by yesterday\u2019s flash floods in eastern Spain now stands at 155, with the toll expected to rise as the search continues. One minister said bodies were likely to have been trapped in cars Rescue workers, residents and the military have been working at pace in a bid to find survivors and to clean-up after yesterday\u2019s floods. There are no confirmed numbers of those missing Spain\u2019s prime minister Pedro Sanchez urged people to stay at home during a visit to flood-hit Valencia and has said they will search for as long as it takes to find any survivors More rain is forecast, with parts of Valencia notably subject to an AEMET yellow weather warning for more rain on Thursday As well as the damage caused to roads, businesses and neighbourhoods, farms in Valencia have also borne the brunt of the flash floods. Fruit farmer Bernardo Ferrer says everything has been lost - his trees caked in thick silt that will make harvesting impossible. \u201cNow the fruit is going to rot. Even the trees can die because they have been under water for 36 hours ... With the heat, the humidity, the fungus will attack them too,\u201d he told the Reuters news agency by phone from his farm in the Alzira area. Valencia as a whole accounts for nearly two-thirds of citrus fruit production in Spain - the world\u2019s top exporter of oranges. Persimmon, a soft, orange-coloured fruit is another major regional crop, along with avocados, almonds and grapes for wine-making. The floods, which have killed at least 155 people and caused massive damage to infrastructure, have affected thousands of hectares of farmland, agricultural groups and farmers said. \u201cWe are facing a catastrophe ... the losses will be in the millions of euros,\u201d said Ricardo Bayo, secretary of the Union of Small Producers (UPA) in Valencia. Another farming group, the Valencia Farmers\u2019 Association, said orange, persimmon and mandarin crops were among those that would be lost. In the rice-growing area of Albufera, fields were totally sumerged, with only a few farm buildings and trees visible above the water, Reuters pictures showed. Ferrer said he was relieved he had insurance to cover his losses. \u201cThe insurance (payout) usually arrives quite quickly but with this scale we\u2019ll have to be patient,\u201d he said. But while citrus crops are generally insured in the region, the proportion of vineyards and nut crops with insurance is low, Bayo said. The floods also washed away machinery, irrigation systems and roads, said Manuel Alcaide, spokesman for farmers\u2019 association COAG, who said it was too early to calculate losses. Livestock was also killed as the floodwaters swept in. In Utiel, one of the worst-affected towns in Valencia, Javier Iranzo and Ana Carmen Fernandez said the flooding had completely wrecked their pig farm, with 50 of their animals having drowned Global heating made the heavy rainfall that lashed Spain this week about 12% heavier and twice as likely, an initial estimate from climate scientists has found. The early-stage analysis, carried out by scientists from the World Weather Attribution, said climate change was \u201cthe most likely explanation\u201d for the unusual strength of the downpour. The group pointed to historical weather observations that showed one-day bursts of rain in the region have increased as fossil fuel pollution has heated the planet. They also highlighted a physical relationship that shows hotter air can hold more moisture - about 7% for every 1C that temperatures rise. \u201cWe are loading the dice of extreme weather in the worst way possible,\u201d said Ben Clarke, a researcher at Imperial College London. To properly quantify the influence of global heating, the group would have to use models to project the probability of such heavy rainfall hitting in a hypothetical climate without human activity. Their estimate comes as a separate analysis from Climate Central finds climate change made the hot sea surface temperatures that fuelled the downpour at least 50 to 300 times more likely. These new images in from Valencia this afternoon are just a snapshot of the impact on homes and streets caused by the flash flooding \u2013 with more rain forecast on Thursday. The pictures show scenes of ruin and destruction, with homes damaged and cars piled up and strewn across roads in the area The number now killed in yesterday\u2019s flash floods in Valencia stands at 155, according to regional authorities. This is an increase on the 140 confirmed earlier today and a jump on the 95 confirmed just yesterday. As we reported earlier, the Spanish government has pledged to continue the search for survivors \u201cfor as long as it takes\u201d. The Spanish top flight football game between Valencia and Real Madrid scheduled for this weekend has been called off in light of these week\u2019s multiple tragedies. The match was due to take place at Valencia\u2019s Mestalla stadium on Saturday evening. In a statement released by Real Madrid this afternoon, it said: \u201cDue to the natural catastrophe that has occurred in the Comunidad Valenciana as a result of a hurricane, having decreed three days of official mourning with the suspension of sporting competitions in the cited autonomous region, a request for a postponement has been received from the LIGA F, after speaking with all the clubs involved. \u201cIn the light of the circumstances of force majeure arising from the events referred to above, it is necessary to postpone the matches scheduled to take place.\u201d Other La Liga and Segunda Divisi\u00f3n matches due to be played this weekend in the Valencia region have also been postponed - Villarreal-Rayo Vallecano, Castell\u00f3n-Racing de Ferrol, Eldense-Huesca and Levante-M\u00e1laga. Sam Jones Madrid correspondent In the small Valencian town of Utiel, where six people died in the floods, residents were trying to come to terms with what had happened as they carted bucketloads of sodden possessions from their homes and tried to sweep out the mud. Around them, personnel from the army\u2019s military emergencies unit supervised the clean-up and the pumps, aided by Guardia Civil officers, firefighters and civil protection units. In the worst affected part of the town, where the river Magro had burst its banks and sent floodwaters surging into people\u2019s houses, the mud was still calf-deep in places and the streets littered with wrecked cars and other detritus. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you want happened here,\u201d said one local resident, Carmen Aleixandre. \u201cI just don\u2019t have the words to describe it.\u201d Utiel\u2019s mayor, Ricardo Gabald\u00f3n, said the town was at the end of its tether and desperately needed help from the regional and national governments. \u201cSix people died and we\u2019re mourning them, but hundred of people could have died here,\u201d he said. In some parts of the town, the floodwaters reached a height of three metres, trapping some people in their homes and leading to the deaths of the victims, who were older people or those with mobility issues. The mayor said water and shelter were still major problems for many in the town, adding that some people were now homeless. \u201cThere\u2019s no power in some places and we\u2019re having to restrict water,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are hundreds of people who\u2019ve lost everything - their houses and their businesses.\u201d The death toll as a result of the flash floods in eastern Spain has risen from 95 to 140, according to state-run news agency EFE. Images from the US Landsat-8 satellite from 8 and 30 October vividly illustrate the scale of the disaster, showing the dramatic transformation of the landscape: We would like to hear from people in Spain about the impact of the flooding. Have you been affected by the recent flooding? How are you coping? We would like to hear about your experiences. You can tell us how you have been affected by the flooding using the form on this link: The satellite image comparison below shows just how badly impacted Valencia was by the torrential rain. The top picture \u2013 captured by the NASA/USGS Landsat 8 Earth observation satellite \u2013 above the white line shows Valencia on October 13. The lower image, below the white line, is the same city on October 30 after the rain caused flash floods. Our video team have produced this, showing shocking footage of a bridge being washed away in Valencia. Agence France-Presse have a dispatch from Paiporta, a suburb of Valencia city at the epicentre of the damage, where 27-year-old musician David Romero lamented a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d. \u201cNeighbourhood after neighbourhood, street after street, there is not a business standing,\u201d he told AFP. Romero said the warnings in Paiporta only arrived when the local river was already overflowing and catching people off guard in the streets, a complaint echoed by 21-year-old Joaquin Rigon. \u201cNobody warned of anything... they took out the owner of the bar here dead, drowned, chaos,\u201d he said. If you\u2019re just joining our coverage today here\u2019s a brief round-up of the situation in Spain. Stay with us while we keep you updated The number of people killed by yesterday\u2019s flash floods in eastern Spain stands at 95, with the toll expected to rise as the search continues Rescue workers, residents and the military have been working at pace in a bid to find survivors and to clean-up after yesterday\u2019s floods. There are no confirmed numbers of those missing Spain\u2019s prime minister Pedro Sanchez has urged people to stay at home and has said they will search for as long as it takes to find any survivors More rain is forecast, with parts of Valencia notably, subject to an AEMET yellow weather warning for more rain on Thursday These pictures \u2013 just coming into us now \u2013 show the extent of the clean-up operation taking place in Valencia and north and eastern parts of Spain hit by yesterday\u2019s deadly floods. Streets are caked in mud, cars are stranded and homes have been severely damaged by yesterday\u2019s torrential rainfall. The flags at the European Commission have been flown at half mast today. EU commission president Ursula von der Leyen has offered Spain support in the wake of yesterday\u2019s flooding As we reported earlier, Pedro S\u00e1nchez has arrived in Valencia and has been speaking to the media. \u201cThe priority right now is to find those who are missing in order to alleviate the anguish that families are suffering,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe will support the search by land, sea and air for as long as it takes to find all of the missing people.\u201d \u201cPlease, the storm continues, please stay at home. Please heed all calls from the emergency services, their needs, their recommendations. \u201cThe most important thing is to save as many lives as possible. The AEMET is issuing alerts, I ask that these recommendations be heeded.\u201d More now on the impact of the floods on communities in regions in and around Valencia. \u201cUnfortunately, there are dead people inside some vehicles,\u201d said Spain\u2019s transport minister \u00d3scar Puente in reference to hundreds of cars and trucks stranded on roads stained brown with mud. The aftermath of the floods looked eerily similar to the damage left by a strong hurricane or tsunami. Cars piled on one another like broken toys, uprooted trees, downed power lines and household items all mired in a layer of mud covered the streets of Barrio de la Torre, just one of dozens of damaged localities in the hard-hit region, where 92 people died between late Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Walls of rushing water turned narrow streets into death traps and spawned rivers that ripped into the ground floors of homes and swept away cars, people and anything else in its path. It knocked down bridges and made roads unrecognisable. \u201cThe neighbourhood is destroyed, all the cars are on top of each other, it\u2019s literally smashed up,\u201d said Christian Viena, a bar owner in Barrio de la Torre. Ground crews and citizens continued to inspect vehicles and homes that were damaged by the onslaught of water. Why were yesterday\u2019s floods in Spain so bad? Ninety-five people are dead, an unknown number of people remain missing, while thousands of others are without electricity or phone service. The intense rain was attributed to a phenomenon known as the gota fr\u00eda, or \u201ccold drop\u201d, which occurs when cold air moves over the warm waters of the Mediterranean Sea. This creates atmospheric instability as the warm, moist air rising rapidly to form towering, dense clouds capable of dumping heavy rain. See below for a visual guide to yesterday\u2019s devastating events Let\u2019s return now to the rescue efforts currently ongoing in north and eastern Spain. More than one thousand soldiers from Spain\u2019s emergency rescue units joined regional and local emergency workers in the search for survivors. Spain\u2019s defence minister said that soldiers alone had recovered 22 bodies and rescued 110 people by Wednesday night. \u201cWe are searching house by house,\u201d \u00c1ngel Mart\u00ednez, official of a military emergency unit, told Spain\u2019s national radio broadcaster RNE on Thursday from the town of Utiel, where at least six people died. As we reported earlier, prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez is heading to the region to witness the destruction first-hand as the nation starts a three-day period of official mourning. Thousands of people were left without water and electricity and hundreds were stranded after their cars were wrecked or roads were blocked. In the rural town of Utiel, some 85 km from the city of Valencia, the Magro river burst its banks, sending up to three metres of water into homes, reports the Reuters news agency. Utiel\u2019s mayor, Ricardo Gabaldon said at least six people had died in the town of about 12,000, most of them elderly or disabled people who were unable to clamber to safety. Early on Thursday, residents used water pumps carried on tractors as they started the clean-up, with children helping to sweep the sidewalks. \u201cThe sorrow is for the people who have died,\u201d said Encarna, a 60-year-old teacher in the town, wiping away tears as she spoke in a flood-ravaged street near her damaged home. \u201cThese are my savings, my effort, my life. But we are alive.\u201d The floods have also wrecked crops and killed livestock. Utiel residents Javier Iranzo, 47, and Ana Carmen Fernandez, 48, told Reuters the flooding had completely wrecked their pig farm, with 50 of their animals having drowned. They estimated hundreds of thousands of euros worth of damages and, despite government pledges of help, said they worried about whether they would receive state aid to help rebuild. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez is due to make a visit to Valencia later today \u2013 we\u2019ll keep you updated when that happens. He has thanked EU commission president Ursula von der Leyen and UN general secretary Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for their support. Here\u2019s a reminder of what he had to say after the floods hit: Rescuers today face the painstaking process of searching stranded cars for any survivors of yesterday\u2019s flash floods, with these pictures of a motorway in Valencia showing the aftermath of the torrential rain. Spain\u2019s transport minister has said bodies of dead are still likely to be trapped in vehicles. Pictures coming in from Valencia show relatively calm conditions as the clean-up and search for survivors continues. But as we touched on in our post at 9.17GMT, a weather warning has been issued for part of the region already devastated by yesterday\u2019s tragedy. The AEMET state weather agency issued its highest level of alert for the province of Castellon. Further north in the Catalonia region, an amber alert was issued for the city of Tarragona. Meteorologists said a year\u2019s worth of rain had fallen in eight hours in parts of Valencia on Tuesday. The storm that caused the torrential downpours has since moved in a northeasterly direction. \u201cThere are already very strong storms in the area, especially in the north of Castellon,\u201d AEMET posted on its X account. \u201cThe adverse weather continues! Beware!\u201d it added, saying people should not travel to the area. Local authorities have not disclosed how many people are still unaccounted for after Europe\u2019s deadliest floods in years, but Defence Minister Margarita Robles said late on Wednesday the death toll was likely to rise. How have you been affected? If you have been impacted by the flooding The Guardian\u2019s community team would like to hear from you. We\u2019re also interested in hearing from those helping with rescue efforts. Get in touch below More heavy rain is predicted for the hardest-hit eastern Valencia region and other areas on the north-east coast today. National weather agency AEMET launched a red alert for Valencia region on Tuesday morning and conditions deteriorated throughout the day. But it was only in the early evening that the regional body in charge of coordinating the emergency services was set up. And an alert sent by the civil protection service urging residents in the Mediterranean coastal city of Valencia not to leave home was issued after 8pm. For many, it was already too late. Motorists began journeys only to find themselves trapped on roads and left at the mercy of raging torrents of water. \u201cThey raised the alarm when the water was already here, there\u2019s no need to tell me the flood is coming,\u201d fumed Julian Ormeno, a 66-year-old pensioner in the Valencia city suburb of Sedavi. \u201cNobody came to take responsibility,\u201d he told AFP. With weather forecasters issuing warnings beforehand, such tragedies are \u201centirely avoidable\u201d if people can be kept away from surging flood water, said Hannah Cloke, hydrology professor at the University of Reading. The devastating outcome suggests Valencia\u2019s warning system failed, she said. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t know what to do when faced with a flood, or when they hear warnings.\u201d \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be dying from these kinds of forecasted weather events in countries where they have the resources to do better,\u201d added Liz Stephens, a professor in climate risks and resilience at the University of Reading. \u201cWe have a long way to go to prepare for this kind of event, and worse, in future.\u201d You can read the full story below Experts have been giving their reaction to yesterday\u2019s disaster - sounding a warning about our preparedness and ability to cope. Extreme weather events are becoming more intense, are lasting longer and are occurring more frequently as a result of human-induced climate change, scientists say. \u201cOur infrastructure is not designed to deal with these levels of flooding,\u201d Hayley Fowler, professor of climate change impacts at Britain\u2019s Newcastle University. She added \u201crecord-shatteringly hot\u201d warmer sea temperatures fuel storms that dump extreme levels of rain in one place. Such extreme weather \u201ccan overwhelm the ability of existing defences and contingency plans to cope, even in a relatively wealthy country like Spain\u201d, said Leslie Mabon, senior lecturer in environmental systems at Britain\u2019s Open University. \u201cThe floods in Spain are a timely reminder that no country is exempt from the risks of climate change.\u201d For Linda Speight, a lecturer at the School of Geography and the Environment at the University of Oxford, warnings for intense thunderstorms are \u201cincredibly hard to issue\u201d as the exact location of the heaviest rainfall is usually unknown in advance. \u201cWe urgently need to adapt our cities to be more resilient to floods,\u201d she added, suggesting making space for water to flow through urban environments without causing damage. \u201cWe take preparation for other hazards such as earthquakes and tsunami very seriously,\u201d added Jess Neumann, associate professor of hydrology, at the University of Reading. \u201cIt is time we afforded the same to flood risk preparedness.\u201d As we\u2019ve been reporting this morning, there are ongoing efforts to find survivors. However, Emiliano Garc\u00eda-Page, the president of the Castilla La-Mancha communitieas, has said part of the hard-hit village of Letur remains inaccessible to crews. The region said yesterday two people had died. Five residents of Letur remained missing. \u201cIn Letur, specifically, it still hasn\u2019t been possible to access part of the village,\u201d Garc\u00eda-Page told reporters. \u201cThe prognosis is pessimistic, but until we find people and confirm things, we will cling to hope.\u201d Residents of Chiva, a small town on the outskirts of Valencia, can expect a grim future of worsening drought as the planet heats up and the country dries out. But on Tuesday, they also witnessed a year\u2019s worth of rainfall in a matter of hours. The torrential rains that flooded southern and eastern Spain on Tuesday night, ripping away bridges and tearing through towns, have killed scores of people. Fossil fuel pollution plays a role in warping both extremes of the water cycle: heat evaporates water, leaving people and plants parched, but hot air can hold more moisture, increasing the potential for catastrophic downpours. \u201cDroughts and floods are the two sides of the same climate change coin,\u201d said Stefano Materia, an Italian climate scientist at Barcelona Supercomputing Centre. He said studies had linked droughts in the Mediterranean with the climate emergency through changes in atmospheric circulation at the same time that global temperature rise had severely heated the region. Read on here: Authorities have confirmed a mother and baby were among the victims swept away in yesterday\u2019s floods in the Valencia suburbs. Around 40 people were confirmed to have died in Paiporta alone. Tens of thousands of homes across the area are still without electricity and drinking water and many roads were blocked by hundreds of cars and trucks swept away in sudden torrents. Emergency services carried out 200 rescues on the ground and 70 aerial evacuations on Wednesday, said Valencia regional government chief Carlos Mazon. This week\u2019s floods were Spain\u2019s worst since 1996, when 87 people died after torrential rain hit a campsite in the Pyrenees mountains. Europe\u2019s most recent deadly floods came in July 2021, killing 243 people in Germany, Belgium, Romania, Italy and Austria. The intense rain has been attributed to a phenomenon known as the gota fr\u00eda, or \u201ccold drop\u201d, which occurs when cold air moves over the warm waters of the Mediterranean. This creates atmospheric instability, causing warm, saturated air to rise rapidly, leading to heavy rain and thunderstorms. Experts say the warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe. Here are some of the latest images from affected areas in Spain: The gratitude that greeted Tuesday\u2019s dawn downpours was short-lived in Utiel. When the longed-for rains finally reached the town in the drought-stricken eastern Spanish region of Valencia, they were merciless in their abundance. \u201cPeople were very happy at first because they\u2019d been praying for rain as their lands needed water,\u201d said Remedios, who owns a bar in Utiel. \u201cBut by 12 o\u2019clock, this storm had really hit and we were all pretty terrified.\u201d Trapped in the bar, she and a handful of her customers could only sit and watch as Spain\u2019s worst flooding in almost 30 years caused the Magro River to overflow its banks, trapping some residents in their homes and sending cars and rubbish bins surging through the streets on muddy flood waters. \u201cThe rising waters brought mud and stones with them and they were so strong that they broke the surface of the road,\u201d said Remedios, who gave only her first name. \u201cThe tunnel that leads into the town was half-full of mud, trees were down and there were cars and rubbish containers rolling down the streets. My outside terrace has been destroyed \u2013 the chairs and shades were all swept away. It\u2019s just a disaster.\u201d By Wednesday afternoon, the death toll in Valencia and the neighbouring regions of Castilla-La Mancha and Andaluc\u00eda stood at 95 . Utiel\u2019s mayor, Ricardo Gabald\u00f3n, told Las Provincias newspaper that some of the town\u2019s residents had not survived the floods, but was unable to provide an exact number. Hours earlier, Gabald\u00f3n had told Spain\u2019s national broadcaster, RTVE, that Tuesday had been the worst day of his life. \u201cWe were trapped like rats,\u201d he said. \u201cCars and rubbish containers were flowing down the streets. The water was rising to 3 metres.\u201d Rescue personnel and more than 1,100 soldiers from Spain\u2019s emergency response units have been deployed to affected areas. Spain\u2019s central government has also set up a crisis committee to coordinate rescue efforts. As the search for missing people continues, motorists are urged to stay off the roads and away from swollen rivers amid warnings that the severe weather was not over and that the number of deaths could still rise. Rescue workers in Spain continued to search for more victims after deadly floods, as questions were raised about how one of the world\u2019s most developed nations failed to respond adequately to an extreme storm. Torrential rains that began at the start of the week sparked flooding that has left at least 95 people dead, the deadliest such disaster in the western European country since 1973. Defence minister Margarita Robles told Cadena Ser radio station that a military unit specialised in rescue operations would on Thursday start combing through the mud and debris with sniffer dogs in the worst-hit areas. Asked if the number of victims was likely to increase, she said: \u201cUnfortunately we are not optimistic\u201d. The teams have brought with them 50 mobile morgues. More heavy rain was predicted for the hardest-hit eastern Valencia region and other areas on the north-east coast on today."

            "date": "2024-10-13T05:00:47Z",
            "content": "The havoc unleashed by Hurricane Milton provided unambiguous evidence that we are entering a critical and alarming new phase in the planet\u2019s climate crisis. Rising fossil fuel emissions have triggered increases in ocean temperatures and sea levels to such an extent they are generating some of the most destructive storms ever experienced in Florida. Together with Hurricane Helene earlier, the lives of about 250 people have been claimed and thousands of homes destroyed. Florida has been left reeling and forecasters have warned there is more to come \u2013 a lot more. It is a grim prognosis that should be galvanising Florida\u2019s political leaders into taking urgent action to protect the state. Extraordinarily, this has not been the case. Despite the intensification of hurricanes and worsening flooding over the past decade, governor Ron DeSantis has consistently rejected the idea that global warming poses a threat to Florida or that the phenomenon exists at all. A few weeks ago, he signed a law erasing the words \u201cclimate change\u201d from state statutes and effectively pledged the state\u2019s future to burning fossil fuels. Such behaviour is disturbing. DeSantis is a Republican who is matched in the vehemence of his climate denials by his party\u2019s candidate for the US presidency, Donald Trump. Should the latter triumph in next month\u2019s election, the tribulations that afflict Florida will be escalated and repeated across the nation and the rest of the planet. Trump has vowed to dismantle the environmental policies introduced by President Joe Biden and promised to allow increases in the production of fossil fuels by drilling on public lands. In doing so, Trump would allow billions of tonnes of extra carbon to be pumped into our already overheated atmosphere and send a clear signal to other nations, which might be wavering in their commitment to the fight against global warming, that they need not bother to act. Such an entirely plausible scenario would have grim implications for our already endangered planet. Global temperatures are close to reaching the 1.5C rise that the 2015 Paris agreement pledged to try to prevent. Today, a rise of 2C seems inevitable, with worse likely to follow. Jim Skea, the chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), recently warned the world was headed towards 3C warming by 2100 if current policies are maintained. In such an overheated world, several catastrophic points of no return would be passed, from the runaway melting of ice sheets to the Amazon rainforest drying out, on top of catastrophic sea-level rises and the displacement of millions of people whose homelands have become uninhabitable. Earth will become meteorologically and politically unstable. It is an extraordinary situation made all the more alarming by the basic observation that we have known about these dangers for decades but have done little to impose measures that might deflect them. In a few weeks, politicians and scientists will meet at Cop29, the UN climate change conference, that will be held in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. The meeting should be an opportunity for world leaders to galvanise nations into action. This is unlikely, with most of the discussion expected to focus on methods by which developed nations can pay poorer countries to transition away from fossil fuels and adapt to climate change\u2019s worst impacts. A commitment to end fossil fuel burning was agreed in principle at the last Cop, meeting but there has been little movement, say observers. Carbon emissions look set to continue for a long time. This leaves the world with one last option. If we refuse to halt the burning of fossil fuels with sufficient speed, we must find ways to catch the resulting emissions as they are created or \u2013 further in the future \u2013 after they have reached the atmosphere. This means developing ways to extract carbon emissions at factories and power plants and then to sequester them. This is carbon capture and storage (CCS), a process that recently received a major boost in the UK when the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, announced a \u00a322bn investment in CCS schemes that would eventually lead to 8.5m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year being removed from emissions from British industrial plants. It should be noted that the UK emitted 384m tonnes of carbon dioxide last year, so the scheme will clearly make little difference to our overall contribution to global warming. However, it should, if successful, highlight a route for tackling the crisis by providing us with an additional weapon in the fight against global warming alongside renewable energy, electric cars and home insulation. From that perspective, Miliband deserves congratulation \u2013 though questions remain. Why should public money be spent on cleaning up emissions created by the fossil fuels that make private companies so much money, for example? Crucially, we are failing to halt global warming. We are not going to stop carbon in the atmosphere reaching dangerous levels quickly enough and so will need to find ways to remove it once it has got there. We are going to need every weapon we can develop for this purpose if we are to deal with the greatest threat that faces civilisation today. The alternative is the global spread of the carnage that last week engulfed Florida."

            "content": "Some nights, when the wind blows from the east, Yvonne Johnstone goes to sleep to the hum of the Tarong power station. Occasionally, she finds ash from the coal-fired plant scattered among the vegetables and fruit trees of her five-acre block. \u201cIt forms a ring,\u201d she says. \u201cAs if it\u2019s gone up in a cloud and then fallen\u201d. Johnstone doesn\u2019t think twice about it \u2013 but what of federal opposition leader Peter Dutton\u2019s proposal to build a nuclear reactor within cooee of her smartly painted, corrugated iron home? Dutton and the Coalition\u2019s proposal is to build seven nuclear power plants across Australia along with two proposed small modular reactors. The opposition wants them in Tarong and Callide in Queensland; Mount Piper and Liddell in New South Wales; Collie in Western Australia; Loy Yang in Victoria; and the former site of the Northern power station in Port Paterson, South Australia. The sites are mostly in Coalition seats. The Queensland LNP\u2019s leader, David Crisafulli, facing an election, has been steadfast in his defiance of Dutton\u2019s plan for the Queensland sites. He says he would oppose them if elected at the 26 October poll and has repeatedly ruled out repealing the state\u2019s nuclear ban under any circumstances. But Dutton, a fellow Queenslander, has previously suggested overriding state legislation. \u201cWhen you hear nuclear, of course you start to panic,\u201d Johnstone, a retired biscuit factory worker, says. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure that they can\u2019t just have something that dangerous in a suburb. \u201cI\u2019m a person that buries her head in the sand, I suppose, and gets on with what I want to do\u201d. Suburb is a generous description for the couple of dozen acreages hacked into the Tarong forest \u2013 and not everyone here is so comfortable at the prospect of living in the shadow of a nuclear power plant. Her neighbour, Brian Collison, concisely explains why. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cChernobyl,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know? Big hole in the ground that no one can do anything about?\u201d The 65-year-old farmhand moved to his Tarong block 22 years ago, drawn to its wildlife and proximity to both bush and the corn and peanut fields he works. Collison is no greenie. \u201cPeople make me laugh, they go and buy an electric car and plug it into a power point. Well, where does the power come from?\u201d he says, pointing in the direction of the coal plant. And if the power station and adjacent Meandu coalmine were closed down tomorrow, he says, nearby Nanango would \u201cturn into a ghost town\u201d. Still, Collison can see the energy transition occurring rapidly before his eyes, with several large-scale solar and windfarms being built in this rich agricultural region to Brisbane\u2019s north-west. With renewables \u201call going ahead\u201d, Collison says a gradual transition from coal to solar and wind is \u201ca no-brainer\u201d. \u201cSo, to me, why do you want to build a monster?\u201d Collison does not believe Crisafulli when he says he would defy his party\u2019s federal leader \u2013 should both be elected \u2013 and reject Dutton\u2019s nuclear vision. On this basis alone, the farmhand will vote for Labor at Queensland\u2019s state election this 26 October. He will be in the minority, however, according to John Cole, a emeritus professor at the University of Southern Queensland. Cole grew up not far from here and well knows the electorate long ruled by Kingaroy peanut farmer \u2013 and Queensland\u2019s longest-serving premier \u2013 Joh Bjelke-Petersen. \u201cHell will freeze over before Kingaroy votes Labor,\u201d Cole says. Crisafulli, though, is brooking no distractions as he seeks to become just the second conservative leader to win a majority of seats at a Queensland election in 38 years. \u201c[Crisafulli] needs nuclear energy like a hole in the head,\u201d Cole says. For some, that small-target strategy is working. In the village of Maidenwell, about 15km south-west of Tarong at the foothills of the Bunya Mountains, inside an old garage that has been converted to a bar, diner and gift shop, there is unease about the prospect of nuclear industry in the neighbourhood \u2013 but also some wind at its back. Perched alone at the bar is a David \u201cBushie\u201d Stewart, his long white beard flowing from under a battered felt hat and clad in a blue singlet revealing arms full of tattoos. Cracking his tinnies from behind the bar is Peter Henry. Both are retired from working in the nearby coalmine and power station; both would prefer that plants be kept online while there is coal to be dug. Henry worries about how much water a nuclear station would need to draw and whether it would have a target on it in the event of conflict. A young cook, Blake, chips in from the kitchen with his two cents\u2019 worth. \u201cI\u2019d prefer it to be out woop woop,\u201d he says of a nuclear plant. \u201cThis is woop woop,\u201d Bushie counters from the bar. \u201cMore woop woop,\u201d Blake says. Peter\u2019s wife, Deborah Henry, who runs this and two other tourism-related businesses into which she has invested her life savings, is the most forthright in expressing her fears. \u201cAny human error and we\u2019ll be dead, or we\u2019ll have cancer,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I came out here for the fresh air\u201d. But Crisafulli\u2019s anti-nuclear stance has satisfied Henry. She\u2019ll be voting LNP. Tarong\u2019s power station is largely hidden from view by forest, but five hours\u2019 north up the Burnett Highway, signs point towards a scenic lookout of the open cut coalmine and coal-fired Callide power plant. Taking in the view, dressed in blue jeans, a high viz top, her blond hair in a ponytail, is Ann Lederhose. The sales representative for a company that services the mining, oil and gas industries, she is about to drive 115km east to her home in Gladstone. Lederhose is sympathetic to communities and families reliant on its jobs, but says coal-fired power stations are \u201cvery much a thing of the past\u201d. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep digging shit out of the ground and burning it,\u201d she says. \u201cOr coal anyway.\u201d Uranium, though, is a different matter. Nuclear energy, she believes, \u201cis the way we are going to have to go\u201d. Lederhose agrees too with advocates who propose a nuclear plant at Gladstone, saying it would be a \u201csensible solution\u201d for the port city home to the state\u2019s largest coal-fired power plant. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of dirty industry there that puts a lot of emissions out,\u201d she says. \u201cSo anything that they can do to clean that environment would be a massive bonus.\u201d Opposition to renewables is also more overt around Callide. Anti-renewable signs dot the landscape, including at the front gate of nearby farmer Darren Jensen\u2019s property \u201cGrandview\u201d \u2013 a vista that includes Callide\u2019s smoking stacks and cooling towers, just a few kilometres away. \u201cI\u2019m fine with it,\u201d Jensen says of the power station. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have a problem with nuclear being there at all. \u201cYou go all over Europe and all over America and there\u2019s nuclear power stations operating safely everywhere.\u201d Jensen does, however, have a problem with the burgeoning solar and wind industries. As well as the loss of arable land, Jensen\u2019s worries include the impact of high voltage towers upon land value, clearing of natural habitat and less secure jobs and more waste associated with ageing panels and turbines. \u201cMore often than not\u201d an LNP voter, Jensen says he may cast a protest vote for One Nation on energy. \u201cMy personal preference is nuclear, I reckon it\u2019s a great technology,\u201d he says. \u201cBut why rush? Keep burning coal until we can have that technology available.\u201d Dr Amanda Cahill, the chief executive of the not-for-profit The Next Economy, is picking up on angst at renewable energy in the regions and says \u201cnuclear is catching on more than some people expected\u201d. And she can understand why. Cahill says the climate wars that engulfed Australian politics for at least the decade to 2022 meant many discussions around energy transition were held \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d. So the money and projects now pouring into the renewable sector has caught some communities by surprise. But \u201cthis whole conversation\u201d about nuclear, Cahill says, is only adding fuel to a climate of \u201cconfusion and chaos and uncertainty\u201d. \u201cAnd it\u2019s making people nervous.\u201d"

            "title": "Gambling poses huge global threat to public health, experts warn",
            "date": "2024-10-24T22:30:02Z",
            "content": "Gambling poses a growing worldwide threat to public health, with its rapid expansion via mobile phones and the internet harming far more people than previously thought, a report warns. Much stronger global regulatory controls are urgently needed to curb the impact of commercial gambling on global health and wellbeing, a group of leading experts in gambling, public health, global health and regulatory policy concluded. About 450 million people have at least one behavioural symptom or have experienced a harmful personal, social or health consequence of gambling, the 45-page report from the Lancet public health commission on gambling found. Of those, at least 80 million people suffer from gambling disorder, a mental health condition identified by a pattern of repeated and continuous betting despite negative consequences on a person\u2019s life. The estimates of the numbers experiencing significant harm to their health as a result of gambling are likely to be conservative, the experts said. Incredibly sophisticated marketing, ever-widening easy access to the internet and mobile phones are enabling the gambling industry to reach more people than ever before. These included adolescents and younger children who were routinely exposed to advertising of gambling products in ways that were unprecedented before the digital revolution, the report found. Prof Heather Wardle, the co-chair of the commission, said the huge global threat posed to public health was rooted in the fast changing nature of gambling. \u201cMost people think of a traditional Las Vegas casino or buying a lottery ticket when they think of gambling. They don\u2019t think of large technology companies deploying a variety of techniques to get more people to engage more frequently with a commodity that can pose substantial risks to health, but this is the reality of gambling today,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone with a mobile phone now has access to what is essentially a casino in their pocket, 24 hours a day. Highly sophisticated marketing and technology make it easier to start, and harder to stop gambling, and many products now use design mechanics to encourage repeated and longer engagement.\u201d Wardle, a specialist in gambling research, policy and practice from the University of Glasgow, added: \u201cThe global growth trajectory of this industry is phenomenal; collectively we need to wake up and take action. If we delay, gambling and gambling harms will become even more widely embedded as a global phenomenon and much harder to tackle.\u201d A systematic review and meta analysis conducted for the commission estimated that gambling disorder affected 15.8% of adults and 26.4% of adolescents who used online casino or slot products, and 8.9% of adults and 16.3% of adolescents who gambled using sports betting products. Online casino and online sports betting are two of the most rapidly expanding areas for commercial gambling globally, the report found. Commercial gambling is clearly associated with financial losses and the risk of financial ruin, but it is also associated with physical and mental health problems, relationship and family breakdown, heightened risk of suicide and domestic violence, increased crime against property and people, and loss of employment, the experts concluded. The commission report noted that this impact was not spread evenly through populations, and specific groups faced an \u201celevated risk\u201d of harms including adolescents and younger children who were routinely exposed to advertising of gambling products. In addition, gambling is often embedded into the architecture of video games. Dr Kristiana Siste, one of the report\u2019s experts, said: \u201cWe need to take action to protect children from the harms of gambling. We know that early exposure to gambling increases the risk of developing gambling disorders later in life, and children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the allure of easy money and the game-like designs of online gambling.\u201d The report also warned how a complex ecosystem enabled the multibillion dollar gambling industry to promote its products and protects its interests. This includes innovative digital marketing approaches rooted in \u201cdeep surveillance\u201d to target consumers online, as well as widespread sports and broadcast media sponsorship. The experts also raised concerns about how the betting industry undermined legitimate science on the impact of gambling, reframed discussions about its harmful effects to promote individual responsibility and consumer freedom, and influenced political processes around regulation. Prof Malcolm Sparrow, one of the experts behind the report, said the findings pointed to the need for increased regulation of gambling. \u201cWhile the industry continues to promote gambling as harmless entertainment, countries and communities are experiencing rapidly increasing threats from gambling harms. \u201cThe commission urges policymakers to treat gambling as a public health issue, just as we treat other addictive and unhealthy commodities such as alcohol and tobacco.\u201d"

            "title": "\u2018Potential issues\u2019 with Coalition\u2019s planned nuclear reactor sites, safety expert warns",
            "date": "2024-10-24T07:02:46Z",
            "content": "A senior government nuclear safety official says the sites of coal-fired power plants \u201cmight not be adequate\u201d to house the opposition\u2019s proposed taxpayer-funded nuclear reactors. Government agencies and departmental officials were grilled in parliament on Wednesday at a government-backed inquiry into nuclear energy. The inquiry was tasked with scrutinising the Coalition\u2019s controversial plan to lift Australia\u2019s ban on nuclear power and build taxpayer-funded reactors at seven sites. Several officials told the inquiry it would take at least 10 to 15 years to start generating nuclear power once a future government confirmed an intention to build reactors. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has said the Coalition expects to be able to build a small reactor by 2035 or a larger reactor as early as 2037. The Coalition has said putting reactors at the sites of coal-fired power stations would reduce the need to build expensive transmission lines and towers to connect renewables to the grid. At Thursday\u2019s inquiry, the Nationals MP Darren Chester asked the chief regulatory officer of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, Jim Scott, if that approach could save time. Scott said it likely would, but added that this \u201cpresupposes that the sites of current coal-fired plants would be adequate for nuclear sites, because that might not be the case\u201d. He said: \u201cYou have to look at external events \u2013 flooding, natural events \u2013 that could occur. That\u2019s part of the siting process. Given that, the potential issue [is] that the sites of current coal-fired plants might not be adequate for nuclear plants.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Simon Duggan, a deputy secretary in the energy department, listed some of the steps that would be needed for nuclear to go ahead, including setting up management frameworks for health, safety, security, environmental impacts, as well as transport of nuclear fuels and waste, storage of waste and the workforce capability to build, maintain and regulate plants. \u201cBased on the work and the assessments that you have seen from bodies such as CSIRO and the [International Energy Agency] you are looking at around a 10- to 15-year timeframe to put all those prerequisites in place in order to have nuclear power capability in Australia,\u201d Duggan said. Many officers raised the issue of social licence and community consultation, saying this would be a critical step if any nuclear reactors were to be built in the future. The opposition energy spokesman, Ted O\u2019Brien, who is also deputy chair of the inquiry, attacked analysis from the energy department which the energy minister, Chris Bowen, said showed the Coalition\u2019s plan would mean a gap of at least 18% between electricity supply and demand. Duggan said the analysis was based on assumptions supplied by the minister, where there would be no new investment in renewable energy, and that coal-fired power stations would stick to the closure schedule assumed by the Australian Energy Market Operator. But O\u2019Brien said those assumptions, described by Bowen previously as reflecting Coalition plans, were \u201cthe opposite\u201d of what they were planning and were \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d. He said the Coalition had made public statements \u201cwith respect to ensuring there\u2019s no premature closure of baseload power stations, more gas is poured into the grid and renewables continue to be rolled out\u201d. O\u2019Brien asked if Duggan was comfortable with how the minister had presented the analysis to the public. \u201cI am very comfortable,\u201d Duggan replied. Officials from Australia\u2019s Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency both said Australia had deep expertise in nuclear regulation, and did not see problems in expanding that to accommodate a future nuclear power sector. Clare Savage, chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, told the inquiry she did not believe nuclear could be deployed in enough time to cover the closure of coal-fired power plants, which she said were becoming increasingly less reliable as they aged. She told the inquiry that on the same day of the hearing, 26% of the total capacity of Australia\u2019s coal-fired power fleet was offline. Eleven per cent of the coal fleet was down due to unplanned outages, she said."

            "content": "Lithuania\u2019s opposition Social Democratic party has promised to spend \u201cas much money as is needed\u201d on security and defence to counter a potential threat from Russia after it finished a comfortable first in Sunday\u2019s parliamentary elections. \u201cOur election manifesto says it should be not less than 3.5% [of GDP], and this is unavoidable,\u201d the Social Democrat leader and MEP, Vilija Blinkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117, said on Monday after her centre-left party won 52 seats in the 141-member parliament. The Baltic state, which shares a 179-mile (275km) border with Russia, has been one of the EU\u2019s strongest supporters of Kyiv and fiercest critics of Moscow under its outgoing conservative-led government. Blinkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 promised that would not change. Polls show as many as three-quarters of Lithuania\u2019s 2.8 million people believe it could be the target of a Russian invasion in the near future. The country is already among the top Nato spenders, allocating about 3% of its GDP to defence. According to Germany\u2019s Kiel Institute, Lithuania is also among the top three countries in terms of aid for Ukraine in relation to the size of its economy. The Social Democrats, who were last in power from 2012 to 2016, are expected to start negotiations on forming a coalition with the centre-left Union of Democrats \u201cFor Lithuania\u201d and the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union. The centre-right party of the outgoing prime minister, Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117, Homeland Union \u2013 Lithuanian Christian Democrats, finished second with 28 seats. Its leader, the foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, resigned on Monday. Analysts have suggested the Social Democrats\u2019 desired three-way coalition, which would have only a slim majority of 74 seats, may prove too fragile to last long without the backing of a new nationalist party, Nemunas Dawn, which won 20 seats. The Social Democrats have ruled out going into government with Nemunas Dawn, led by a former MP, Remigijus Zemaitaitis, who resigned last year over allegedly antisemitic comments and is on trial on charges of inciting hatred, which he denies. In Bulgaria, meanwhile, which also held parliamentary elections \u2013 its seventh in four years on Sunday, provisional results showed the centre-right GERB party of the former prime minister Boyko Borissov finished first with 26.5% of the votes. However, there seems little likelihood of stability returning to the EU\u2019s poorest member state, which has been in in political limbo since 2021 after massive anti-corruption protests in 2020 triggered the downfall of a Borisov-led cabinet. Six elections since then have failed to yield a sustainable government. The reformist coalition We Continue the Change came second on 14.7%, and the ultra-nationalist, pro-Russian Vazrazhdane (Revival) party a close third on 13.5%. Borissov, who served as prime minister for 13 years before his downfall, on Monday described his victory as \u201ccategorical\u201d, promised he was willing compromise and said he would \u201cwork together with everyone except Revival\u201d. But analysts predicted GERB would again struggle to find coalition partners in a fragmented parliament of nine different parties. Political uncertainty has held up the flow of badly needed EU funds into Bulgaria\u2019s crumbling infrastructure and already contributed to Bulgaria\u2019s plans to join the eurozone being twice pushed back. Turnout rose slightly to 38%, up on the 34% recorded in the previous election in June, but polls showed about 60% of Bulgarians found the continuing deadlock \u201cextremely alarming\u201d. Official results are not expected for several days. If confirmed, Borissov would be handed a mandate to try to form his fourth government \u2013 but the results, which are not significantly different from the six most recent elections, do not look promising and could lead to yet another vote."

In September, unemployment was a mere 4.1% while underemployment fell from 6.5% to 6.3%. This is absolutely good news. Historically good. Think of it like this: if you entered the labour force in October 1974, in your first 576 months of being in the labour force to January 2022, unemployment was below 4.2% just five times.

The low unemployment rate means the likelihood of the next rate cut is further off than it was a month ago (or even just last week): If the graph does not display click here As someone fortunate enough to be paying off a mortgage, I would love a rate cut. As someone who is not a sociopath, I am not going to be sad if more people having a job means I\u2019ll have to wait a few more months before my mortgage repayments drop. The rates will inevitably come down \u2013 there is zero current prospect of them rising \u2013 and inflation is also down. Despite the Reserve Bank thinking the current level of unemployment is lower than it needs to be to stop inflation rising, inflation is falling. Importantly, (as Ross Gittins has also noted) the current level of unemployment is not like the mining-boom blip of early 2008 when the unemployment rate went below 4.2% for three months. It\u2019s been this low for nearly three years. This is not an aberration \u2013 it is the rule. And it should be the ceiling of what both governments and the Reserve Bank view as a standard level. The almost universal belief that the low unemployment level means no rate cut is actually rather weird given all this low unemployment has not brought with it any wages breakout. The most regular wage data we have is enterprise agreements lodged fortnightly with the Fair Work Commission. That data shows wage growth peaked a year ago: If the graph does not display click here But fears \u2013 real or otherwise \u2013 of inflation trump all right now. On Wednesday the IMF raised its predictions for inflation at the end of next year to 3.6% \u2013 surely another blow to a rate cut. But as Peter Hannam, who was one of the few to not lose his head, wrote, this was hardly news \u2013 the predictions just lined up with the most recent RBA estimates and are due to the energy rebate coming off. And while the IMF had increased its estimate for inflation from six months ago, the estimate for average inflation growth through the year is lower than was estimated 12 months ago: If the graph does not display click here Are we really going to sound the alarm because inflation is expected to average 3.3% next year? It really is time for people to calm down. Markets and commentators mostly responded to the low unemployment figures as proof that interest rates won\u2019t be cut because they just assume that low unemployment means stronger wages growth and higher inflation. But wages growth over the past two years has not risen at a pace that would prevent inflation being below 3%. This has not prevented those who lust for higher unemployment purely to satisfy their economic models wishing the RBA and government would do what they could to get unemployment up to 4.5%. For myself, I will continue to be happy that unemployment is low and instead worry that those with a job can get a decent wage rise and those looking for work can stop being forced to live in poverty. A rate cut? That would be nice, but much better news is that more Australians work now than ever before \u2013 and we should celebrate it. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

            "date": "2024-10-20T10:45:31Z",
            "content": "Wes Streeting has denied his plans to give new weight-loss jabs to unemployed people to help them back into work would result in a \u201cdystopian future\u201d where overweight people would be \u201cinvoluntarily jabbed\u201d. The UK health secretary acknowledged that weight-loss drugs were not, on their own, the answer to the nation\u2019s obesity crisis after he suggested this week that they could have a \u201cmonumental\u201d impact on getting more people working. However, he told BBC One\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show that the latest generation of drugs, such as semaglutide or tirzepatide, could be \u201cgamechanging\u201d when it came to reversing the trends in obesity. Streeting had said in an article for the Telegraph that \u201cwidening waistbands\u201d were placing a burden on the NHS, and the drugs could be administered to people to get them back into employment and to ease costs to the health service. The government has announced a \u00a3279m investment from Lilly \u2013 the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical company \u2013 with the deal expected to include real-world trials of weight loss jabs\u2019 impact on unemployment. \u201cI don\u2019t think the answer to obesity is simply weight-loss jabs but there is a lot of evidence that these jabs, combined with changes to diet and exercise, can help people to reduce their weight to reduce cardiovascular disease but also diabetes, which is gamechanging,\u201d Streeting said. \u201cThey\u2019re not the only solution, and I don\u2019t want to create a dependency culture. I\u2019m not interested in some dystopian future where I wander round \u2026 involuntarily jabbing unemployed people who are overweight \u2013 that is not the agenda. \u201cIf we can throw the trends we\u2019re seeing on obesity into reverse, that\u2019s better for the health of the nation \u2026 and the nation\u2019s finances, because we\u2019ve got to shift from treating sickness to actively preventing it. But that\u2019s not a substitute for good diet and nutrition and exercise.\u201d In a round of broadcast interviews, Streeting said he had reached a deal on NHS funding with the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, but could not fix the problems of the last 14 years in one budget. He stressed the need for reform as well as investment in the NHS, saying he was \u201cconscious\u201d that money spent on health was money that could not be spent in other areas. He appeared to suggest that hospitals would have to improve productivity to benefit from additional funding. \u201cCertainly the approach that the chancellor and I are taking is to link investment to reform,\u201d he told the BBC. Asked whether hospital trusts would be penalised if they did not \u201cplay ball\u201d, he added: \u201cWe definitely need to manage performance. \u201cI think it\u2019s a quid pro quo. It\u2019s my responsibility to give system leaders the tools to do the job, and that\u2019s my responsibility as secretary of state, but it\u2019s their responsibility to deliver.\u201d Streeting also said he was boosting the number of NHS appointments, but did not have the exact data needed to see whether the government was on course to meet its pledges. He reiterated that the NHS could not be fixed without also addressing the social care crisis."

            "date": "2024-10-20T06:00:38Z",
            "content": "In early 2023, Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, chief executive of the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, and its UK corporate vice-president Pinder Sahota, met in Whitehall with the then health secretary Steve Barclay, England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and various health and Treasury officials. They discussed the possibilities of a pilot scheme to improve obesity care in the UK. According to internal documents obtained by the Observer, Novo Nordisk wanted \u201cdata from the Department for Work and Pensions\u201d to \u201chelp profile those who are most likely to return to the labour market\u201d. These individuals could then be targeted with Wegovy, the brand name for the company\u2019s weight-loss drug semaglutide. Simon Capewell, emeritus professor of public health at Liverpool University, observed that \u201ctargeting people in the interests of the state, for economic reasons, rather than prioritising the person\u2019s own interests and health\u201d was \u201cunethical\u201d. He also questioned the scientific \u201chonesty\u201d of a pilot scheme testing the efficacy of a drug in helping individuals back into the labour market, but using people who were already \u201cconsidered by the DWP to be borderline for just returning to work\u201d. It would \u201cbe a marvellous bit of marketing for the company\u201d. That Novo Nordisk study never materialised. Eighteen months later, though, a pilot study is being launched, to test not Wegovy but Mounjaro, the market name for tirzepatide, an anti-diabetic and weight-loss injection produced by the US pharmaceutical giant Lilly. The government trumpeted Lilly\u2019s presence at last week\u2019s \u201cinvestment summit\u201d and hailed the company\u2019s \u00a3279m stake in helping \u201cdevelop transformative medicines\u201d and \u201ctrial innovative approaches to treating obesity\u201d. The Mounjaro trial, based in Manchester, will involve 3,000 people in a five-year study of the \u201cnon-clinical outcomes\u201d of treatment to see, in particular, whether the drug can enable more people to return to the workplace. \u201cOur widening waistbands,\u201d health secretary Wes Streeting wrote in an op-ed for the Daily Telegraph, are \u201cholding back our economy\u201d. Politicians are particularly vexed by the rise in the numbers of people who are economically inactive, much of it because of long-term illness. The hope that it may be possible to address this, at least in part, through the use of jabs is beguiling, especially at a time when technical, as opposed to political or social, solutions are in vogue. Drugs such as Wegovy or Mounjaro may well prove useful in helping individuals reduce weight, though their efficacy is far from certain, nor their side effects properly understood. That, though, is significantly different from a government strategy to use them as a means of bringing people back into the labour market. The criticism directed at last year\u2019s proposed Wegovy trial could equally apply to the new Mounjaro study \u2013 that it treats people according to \u201ctheir potential economic value, rather than primarily based on their needs and their health needs\u201d, as Dr Dolly van Tulleken, an obesity researcher at Cambridge University, remarked last week. While many studies show a relationship between unemployment and obesity, that relationship is not straightforward. There is some evidence that being obese reduces the chances of employment, but it is not so much that obesity causes unemployment as that becoming unemployed leads to weight gain. George Orwell understood why. \u201cA millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita biscuits; an unemployed man doesn\u2019t,\u201d he observed in The Road to Wigan Pier, castigating middle-class homilies on working-class diets. \u201cWhen you are unemployed, which is to say when you are underfed, harassed, bored and miserable, you\u2026 want something a little bit \u2018tasty\u2019.\u201d Unemployment \u201cis an endless misery that has got to be constantly palliated\u201d, which is why \u201cthe physical average in the industrial towns is terribly low\u201d. It is an \u201cendless misery\u201d that today is exacerbated by a paucity of decent jobs, a lack of social infrastructure from youth clubs to libraries to pubs, poor transport facilities and shockingly low benefits. Yet, the challenge of unemployment and of poverty continues to be seen as the problem of the individual, of laziness and lifestyle choices. Back in 1978, Margaret Thatcher told the Catholic Herald that poverty did not exist, and if it did, it was only \u201cbecause people don\u2019t know how to budget, don\u2019t know how to spend their earnings\u201d, and that at its heart lies a \u201cpersonality defect\u201d. It would be easy to dismiss this simply as Thatcherite rancour. But the belief that the responsibility for unemployment and poverty lies with the unemployed and the poor themselves, and that such problems reveal moral rather than political or social failings, has deep historical roots and continues to shape policy to this day. When William Beveridge wrote his 1942 report that helped lay the foundations of the postwar welfare state, he described the \u201cFive Great Evils\u201d that plagued society as Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness. Not \u201cunemployment\u201d or \u201cjoblessness\u201d but \u201cidleness\u201d. Even as society moved away from the ethos of Victorian \u201cpoor laws\u201d, that saw the cause of poverty and joblessness in the \u201cindolence\u201d and \u201cintemperance\u201d of the poor, to create the modern welfare state and National Health Service, it retained an echo of the old moralist vision and of the notion of the \u201cundeserving poor\u201d. It\u2019s an echo that could be heard in recent decades, in New Labour\u2019s crusade against \u201cproblem families\u201d, in George Osborne\u2019s division of the nation into \u201cstrivers\u201d and \u201cskivers\u201d, in Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s imposition of a benefit cap on parents with more than two children to teach the poor that \u201cchildren cost money\u201d, which apparently they did not know until he came along. Giving the unemployed weight-loss jabs fits into this history. As does Liz Kendall\u2019s proposal last week to have \u201cjob coaches\u201d visit mental health patients in hospital. And how long before people face sanctions for refusing to cooperate? A decade ago, David Cameron threatened to withdraw benefits from claimants who refused to be treated for obesity. It is not difficult to imagine such a plan reappearing. Once the finger is pointed at the individual, and unemployment and poverty become seen as moral rather than political issues, then coercion is rarely far away. Unemployment is not a medical condition. Medical treatment should not be in the province of the DWP. Confusing the medical and the social makes it more difficult to improve lives in either sphere. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "content": "New weight-loss jabs could be given to unemployed people to help them get back into work, Wes Streeting has suggested. The health secretary said \u201cwidening waistbands\u201d were placing a burden on the NHS. The latest generation of weight-loss medications, involving drugs such as semaglutide or tirzepatide, could be administered to people in order to get them back into employment, and to ease costs to the health service, he added. Streeting\u2019s suggestion, in the Telegraph, comes as the government announced a \u00a3279m investment from Lilly \u2013 the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical company \u2013 on the day the prime minister hosted an international investment summit. The plans announced at the summit will include real-world trials of weight-loss jabs\u2019 impact on worklessness, according to the Telegraph. A study by Health Innovation Manchester and Lilly will examine whether being put on the drugs will reduce worklessness and the impact on NHS service use, and will take place in Greater Manchester. The health secretary wrote: \u201cOur widening waistbands are also placing significant burden on our health service, costing the NHS \u00a311bn a year \u2013 even more than smoking. And it\u2019s holding back our economy. \u201cIllness caused by obesity causes people to take an extra four sick days a year on average, while many others are forced out of work altogether.\u201d Appearing on the BBC on Tuesday, the prime minister appeared to back the idea. Keir Starmer said: \u201cI think these drugs could be very important for our economy and for health.\u201d He added: \u201cThis drug will be very helpful to people who want to lose weight, need to lose weight, very important for the economy so people can get back into work. \u201cVery important for the NHS because, as I\u2019ve said time and again, yes, we need more money for our NHS, but we\u2019ve got to think differently. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to reduce the pressure on the NHS. So this will help in all of those areas.\u201d In his Telegraph article Streeting continued: \u201cThe reforms this government will put in place will open the NHS up to work much more closely with life sciences, to develop new, more effective treatments, and put NHS patients at the front of the queue. \u201cThe long-term benefits of these drugs could be monumental in our approach to tackling obesity. For many people, these weight-loss jabs will be life-changing, help them get back to work, and ease the demands on our NHS.\u201d However, Streeting said individuals would still need to remain responsible for taking \u201chealthy living more seriously\u201d, as the \u201cNHS can\u2019t be expected to always pick up the tab for unhealthy lifestyles\u201d. Dr Dolly van Tulleken, who specialises in obesity policy and is a visiting researcher at the MRC epidemiology unit at the University of Cambridge, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme there were \u201csome serious ethical, financial and efficacy considerations with such an approach \u2026 Such as looking at people, or measuring people based on their potential economic value, rather than primarily based on their needs and their health needs.\u201d She went on: \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important that people in the UK access healthcare based on their health need rather than their potential economic value.\u201d She also said the government would not be able to cover the \u201celigible\u201d population, which is in its millions. Specialist weight management services currently treat 49,000 people a year. But despite scepticism, Van Tulleken said Streeting was on \u201cthe side of the population\u201d, adding: \u201cWe know from across so much research \u2026 how popular these interventions are. People want the government to act. They want to live in a healthy environment; he is absolutely on the side of public.\u201d Lord Bethell, a former Conservative health minister, agreed, telling the same programme his government had \u201cgot it wrong\u201d with its attitude to state intervention on obesity. He said: \u201cWe got it wrong, we misread the public mood; people want help from government \u2013 the \u2018nanny state\u2019 thing was a distraction.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 15 October 2024 to refer to the drug semaglutide, rather than to the brand name Ozempic, which is licensed in the UK as a type-2 diabetes medication. The brand of semaglutide licensed for weight loss is Wegovy."

            "content": "American employers added 254,000 jobs last month in the penultimate jobs report before the US election, defying fears of a slowdown in the labor market. Job creation unexpectedly accelerated in September, while the headline unemployment rate slipped to 4.1% from 4.2% in August. Economists had forecast a non-farm payrolls reading of around 132,500 for September, after a cooler summer of employment growth. Hiring instead rose sharply from recent months. In August employers added 159,000 jobs, and in July, they added 144,000. Both estimates for July and August were revised higher by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday \u2013 adding 72,000 more jobs than previously reported \u2013 highlighting the strength of the labor market. September\u2019s unexpectedly robust data could set the stage for a more complex picture of the US labor market this month after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of the south-east, Boeing was hit with a sweeping strike, and tens of thousands of port workers across the east and Gulf coasts staged a strike this week. The ports strike ended on Thursday night. As November\u2019s presidential election edges closer, the US economy is a key issue for voters. Earlier this week, a Harris Poll for the Guardian found that Kamala Harris\u2019s economic policies proved more popular than those put forward by Donald Trump in a blind test. The poll nevertheless highlighted economic pessimism on both sides of the aisle, with almost half of respondents wrongly stating that the US was in recession. Inflation has fallen dramatically since peaking at its highest level in a generation two summers ago. But concerns over the cost of living continue to loom large, after years of significant price growth. The US has reached a key juncture. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in four years last month, having lifted them to a two-decade high in an effort to cool the economy as part of its aggressive battle to curb inflation. Now price growth is falling, policymakers at the Fed are searching for a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d for their campaign, where inflation is brought back down to typical levels and a broader downturn is avoided. Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, cast doubt on the latest jobs reading \u2013 and suggested it would probably be revised. \u201cSeptember\u2019s spike in payrolls goes against the grain of a wide range of indicators pointing to a continued pullback in hiring,\u201d he said. \u201cThe extremely low response rate to the payroll survey waves a red flag.\u201d Wall Street nevertheless started the day higher. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 rose 0.7% and the technology-focused Nasdaq Compsite increased 1.1%."

            "content": "Survivors of the atomic bombings of Japan almost eight decades ago have won the Nobel peace prize for their campaign to rid the world of nuclear weapons. The Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organisations \u2013 commonly known as Nihon Hidankyo \u2013 received the accolade one year before the 80th anniversary of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and at a time of growing concern about the possible use of nuclear weapons. The Nobel committee said it had decided to award the prize to Nihon Hidankyo \u201cfor its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons and for demonstrating through witness testimony that nuclear weapons must never be used again\u201d. The Norwegian committee said testimony by hibakusha \u2013 survivors of the August 1945 bombings by the US \u2013 had \u201chelped to generate and consolidate widespread opposition to nuclear weapons around the world by drawing on personal stories, creating educational campaigns based on their own experience, and issuing urgent warnings against the spread and use of nuclear weapons\u201d. It added: \u201cThe hibakusha help us to describe the indescribable, to think the unthinkable, and to somehow grasp the incomprehensible pain and suffering caused by nuclear weapons.\u201d Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, who is attending the East Asia summit in Laos, told reporters: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely meaningful that the organisation that has worked toward abolishing nuclear weapons received the Nobel peace prize.\u201d While the committee noted that nuclear weapons had not been used since the end of the second world war, it said the \u201ctaboo\u201d against their use was \u201cunder pressure\u201d. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has refused to rule out the use of tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine, while North Korea has continued to develop nuclear weapons that some experts believe are capable of striking the US mainland. Some will see the prize as a rebuke to Japan\u2019s conservative government, which is dependent for its defence on the US nuclear umbrella and is not among the more than 60 countries that have ratified a 2021 treaty to ban the possession and use of nuclear weapons. \u201cAt this moment in human history, it is worth reminding ourselves what nuclear weapons are: the most destructive weapons the world has ever seen,\u201d the Nobel committee said. Between 60,000 and 80,000 people died instantly after the Enola Gay, a US B-29 bomber, dropped a 15-kiloton nuclear bomb on Hiroshima on the morning of 6 August 1945, with the death toll rising to 140,000 by the end of the year. Three days later, the Americans dropped a plutonium bomb on Nagasaki, killing 74,000. Today, the number of people officially recognised as having died from the effects of the bombings stands at 344,306 in Hiroshima and 198,785 in Nagasaki. The average age of the 106,000 survivors is almost 86, according to Japan\u2019s health ministry. \u201cOne day, the hibakusha will no longer be among us as witnesses to history,\u201d the Nobel committee said. \u201cBut with a strong culture of remembrance and continued commitment, new generations in Japan are carrying forward the experience and the message of the witnesses.\u201d Nihon Hidankyo\u2019s co-chair, Toshiyuki Mimaki, 81, told a news conference in Hiroshima that the group\u2019s recognition would give a major boost to its efforts to demonstrate that the abolition of nuclear weapons was possible, Reuters and Agence France-Presse reported. \u201cIt would be a great force to appeal to the world that the abolition of nuclear weapons can be achieved,\u201d Mimaki said. \u201cNuclear weapons should absolutely be abolished.\u201d He said the idea that nuclear weapons brought peace was a fallacy. \u201cIt has been said that because of nuclear weapons, the world maintains peace. But nuclear weapons can be used by terrorists,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, if Russia uses them against Ukraine, Israel against Gaza, it won\u2019t end there. Politicians should know these things.\u201d MG Sheftall, the author of Hiroshima: The Last Witnesses, which was published last month, said he was \u201cabsolutely elated\u201d by the news. \u201cSince the nadir of the cold war, I don\u2019t think the world has needed renewed awareness of the horror of nuclear weapons more than it needs it now,\u201d he said."

            "content": "Joe Biden had terse words at the White House on Friday for Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he didn\u2019t know whether the Israeli prime minister was holding up a peace deal in the Middle East \u2013 where Israel is at war with Hamas in Gaza and on a military offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon \u2013 in order to influence the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election. \u201cNo administration has helped Israel more than I have. None. None, none. And I think Bibi should remember that,\u201d Biden said, using Netanyahu\u2019s nickname. He added: \u201cAnd whether he\u2019s trying to influence the election, I don\u2019t know \u2013 but I\u2019m not counting on that.\u201d The US president made a surprise and rare appearance in the west wing briefing room and answered reporters\u2019 questions there for the first time in his presidency. He was responding to comments made by one of his allies, Chris Murphy, a Democratic US senator of Connecticut, who said on CNN this week that he was concerned Netanyahu had little interest in a peace deal in part because of American politics. The two leaders have long managed a complicated relationship, but they are running out of space to maneuver as their views on the Israel-Gaza war diverge and their political futures hang in the balance. Biden has pushed for months for a ceasefire agreement in Gaza \u2013 and the president and his aides boosted the idea repeatedly that they were close to success \u2013 but a ceasefire has not materialized. Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, has engaged in shuttle diplomacy to Israel and to peace talks via intermediaries, but to no avail and, in some cases, Netanyahu has publicly resisted the prospect while US and Israeli officials continue to talk in private about eking out a deal. Meanwhile, Israel has recently pressed forward on two fronts, pursuing a ground incursion into Lebanon against Hezbollah and conducting strikes in Gaza. And it has vowed to retaliate for Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack this week, as the region braced for further escalation. Biden said there had been no decision yet on what type of response there would be toward Iran, though there has been talk about Israel striking Iran\u2019s oilfields: \u201cI think if I were in their shoes, I\u2019d be thinking about other alternatives than striking oilfields.\u201d Biden pushed back against the idea that he was seeking a meeting with Netanyahu to discuss the response to Iran. He wasn\u2019t, he said. \u201cI\u2019m assuming when they make a decision on how they\u2019re going to respond, we will then have a discussion,\u201d he said. Netanyahu has grown increasingly resistant to Biden\u2019s efforts. Biden has in turn publicly held up delivery of heavy bombs to Israel and increasingly voiced concerns over an all-out war in the Middle East and yet has never acquiesced to political calls at home or internationally for a halt on US arms sales to Israel. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s going to be an all-out war,\u201d Biden said on Thursday evening. \u201cI think we can avoid it. But there\u2019s a lot to do yet.\u201d Biden has remained consistent in his support for Israel in the aftermath of the 7 October Hamas attacks in Israel. Since then, with few exceptions, Biden has supported ongoing and enhanced US arms transfers to Israel while merely cautioning the Israelis to be careful to avoid civilian casualties. Biden has also ordered the US military to step up its profile in the region to protect Israel from attacks by Hamas, Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and Iran itself. In April, and again earlier this week, the US was a leading player in shooting down missiles fired by Iran into Israel. On Thursday, Biden said the US was \u201cdiscussing\u201d with Israel the possibility of Israeli strikes on Iran\u2019s oil infrastructure. His off-the-cuff remark, which immediately sent oil prices soaring, did not make clear whether his administration was holding internal discussions or talking directly to Israel, nor did he clarify what his attitude was to such an attack. Asked to clarify those comments, Biden told reporters on Friday: \u201cLook, the Israelis have not concluded what they\u2019re going to do in terms of a strike. That\u2019s under discussion.\u201d Kamala Harris also has not taken a different stance on arms sales but has spoken more assertively for months to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and has decried civilian killings in Israel\u2019s war in the Palestinian territory.

            "date": "2024-10-10T10:33:08Z",
            "content": "The jailed Nobel peace prize laureate Narges Mohammadi has marked the first anniversary of her award with a call for peace in the Middle East from Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin prison. The Iranian human rights activist said in comments to Italy\u2019s Corriere della Sera: \u201cToday, the dark shadow of war once again hangs over our beloved country. I hate war. \u201cAll those responsible for war are not only condemned by the people of the lands and times they devastate, but they are also for ever disgraced and ostracised in the annals of human history.\u201d The 52-year-old, whose prison conditions have significantly worsened since being awarded the prize, added: \u201cThese days, as I endure harsh security conditions, I wonder \u2013 does anyone hear our call for \u2018No to war\u2019?\u201d Mohammadi, who has been imprisoned since November 2021 for convictions in relation to her campaigning against capital punishment and the obligatory hijab in Iran, said on Wednesday that her treatment had become even more severe since she was awarded the prize on 6 October 2023. This year\u2019s prize will be announced by the Norwegian Nobel Committee on Friday. A total of 286 candidates \u2013 197 individuals and 89 organisations \u2013 are known to be on the list of nominees, but their identities have not been revealed, in keeping with the committee\u2019s standard practice. Potential winners include the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), the international court of justice, which is tasked with resolving conflicts between countries in the courtroom rather than on the battlefield, and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe\u2019s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. Weeks after the 2023 ceremony in Oslo in December, where Mohammadi\u2019s children collected the prize on her behalf, a revolutionary court in Iran sentenced her to an additional 15 months, accusing of spreading propaganda against the state while in prison. \u201cAfter receiving the Nobel Peace prize, I have been subjected to even tighter restrictions and harsher security conditions,\u201d Mohammadi said. Soon after being awarded the prize, she added, she was \u201ccompletely cut off from any communication with the outside world\u201d. Despite the repercussions, Mohammadi, a leading figure of the Woman, Life, Freedom movement, has remained dedicated to her activism. \u201cThe people of Iran want life with dignity, and Islamic Republic is standing in the way of that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe path forward for people of Iran is to transition from tyranny to democracy.\u201d When her father died earlier this year, she was not allowed to offer condolences to her family in Iran or attend his funeral. She continues to have her requests to speak with her children Kiana and Ali denied and her medical transfer have been \u201crepeatedly cancelled and blocked by security and judicial authorities\u201d. She said: \u201cOver the past month, despite a written order from a heart specialist for urgent angiography, I have been denied permission to leave the prison on three occasions, even after coordination with the hospital, prosecutor\u2019s office, and prison authorities.\u201d She has also been denied physiotherapy for her back, despite severe pain caused by a herniated disc, and banned from receiving eye care. \u201cThe government\u2019s strategy seems to be one of delaying treatment until my health deteriorates completely,\u201d she said. The Woman, Life, Freedom movement has, she said, \u201cnot only visibly shaken the legitimacy of the regime but has also strengthened the foundations of democratic ideas, culture, traditions, and ways of life in society\u201d. This shift, she added, has \u201cfurther ignited the hope of those fighting for democracy, freedom, and equality in this historical moment, though we still face a difficult path ahead\u201d. Earlier this year, her son Ali said the family would never stop fighting for Mohammadi\u2019s freedom. Speaking from their home in Paris, he told the Guardian: \u201cMy mother is the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning.\u201d His twin sister, Kiana, said: \u201cIt\u2019s like a game [for the regime] where they hold all the cards in their hand. Every time my mum thinks she has a good card in her hand they can cheat and change the rules. It\u2019s easy to win for them. We are all helpless in the face of this power.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-24T00:10:32Z",
            "content": "The foreign ministry in Kyiv said on Wednesday that Moscow had failed to win support for its invasion of Ukraine at the Brics summit it is hosting, where Putin faced direct calls to end the conflict from some of his closest and most important partners. \u201cThe Brics summit, which Russia planned to use to split the world, has once again demonstrated that the world majority remains on the side of Ukraine in its quest to guarantee a comprehensive, just and sustainable peace,\u201d the ministry said. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, told the summit that there must be \u201cno escalation of fighting\u201d in Ukraine, saying: \u201cWe must adhere to the three principles of \u2018no spillover from the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no adding oil to the fire by relevant parties\u2019, so as to ease the situation as soon as possible.\u201d The Brazilian president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, called for \u201cavoiding escalation and initiating peace negotiations\u201d. Without referring to any specific conflict, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, also issued a call for peace: \u201cWe support dialogue and diplomacy, not war.\u201d In private talks, Vladimir Putin welcomed offers by several of the Brics leaders to mediate in Ukraine, even as he told them his forces were advancing, said his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, according to Russian state media. North Korean troops would be legitimate military targets \u2013 \u201cfair game\u201d \u2013 if they engaged in combat in Ukraine, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday. The US has said for the first time that it has seen evidence of North Korean troops in Russia, and South Korean lawmakers have said about 3,000 soldiers have been sent to support the Kremlin\u2019s war in Ukraine, with Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime promising to provide a total of about 10,000 troops by December. Alexander Lukashenko \u2013 the Belarusian president, who has stayed in power by running a client state of Russia \u2013 said in interviews broadcast on Wednesday that Putin deploying any foreign forces in the Ukraine conflict would inevitably lead to an escalation, possibly involving Nato troops. Lukashenko claimed it was \u201crubbish\u201d that North Korean troops were going to fight in Ukraine: \u201cKnowing his character Putin would never try to persuade another country to involve its army in Russia\u2019s special operation in Ukraine \u2026 [it] would be a step towards the escalation of the conflict if the armed forces of any country, even Belarus, were on the contact line.\u201d That would prompt Ukraine\u2019s allies to point to foreign involvement \u201cso Nato troops would be deployed to Ukraine\u201d. Ukrainian authorities have announced the mandatory evacuation of children and their families from Borova in the north-eastern region of Kharkiv, where Russian forces have been making advances. The governor of the Donetsk region earlier said all children had been removed from the frontline town of Myrnograd and just several dozen remained in the nearby transport hub of Pokrovsk - the main target of Russian advances. Authorities in the Zaporizhzhia region, which the Kremlin claimed to have annexed alongside Donetsk and two others, said two men aged 40 and 73 had been killed in a drone attack. The Biden administration is trying to provide Ukraine with US$10bn in military aid as part of its $20bn commitment under a $50bn loan coordinated with the G7 and EU, the White House National Security Council said on Wednesday. Joe Biden, the US president, said: \u201cWe will provide $20bn in loans to Ukraine that will be paid back by the interest earned from immobilised Russian sovereign assets. Make no mistake: Russia will not prevail in this conflict \u2026 tyrants will be responsible for the damages they cause\u201d. The US plans to disperse $10bn by December as economic aid, but needs US lawmakers\u2019 approval for a further $10bn, the White House national security council has said on Wednesday. Romania scrambled two F-16 fighter jets after detecting what were probably two drones breaching its national airspace, the Romanian defence ministry said late on Wednesday. It was the third such incident in less than a week. Two signals were picked up by radar less than one hour apart flying above the south-eastern counties of Constanta and Tulcea, the latter bordering Ukraine across the Danube River. The pilots did not see either drone before losing the signals, the ministry said."

            "title": "Florida begins long road to recovery after double hurricane strike",
            "date": "2024-10-12T11:00:23Z",
            "content": "More than just clouds were swirling when a tropical disturbance that would become Hurricane Milton formed in the south-western Gulf of Mexico, beginning its inexorable march towards a midweek strike on Florida\u2019s west coast. As its winds picked up, so did familiar feelings of anxiety and dread across a state still reeling from the impact of another monster storm, Hurricane Helene, barely a week earlier. Ultimately, the densely populated cities of Tampa and St Petersburg were spared the apocalyptic scenario some had forecast. But places elsewhere along the Gulf coast saw unprecedented levels of destruction and devastation. Between them, the two deadly cyclones have so far cost about 250 people their lives, thousands more their homes, and left millions of Florida residents and businesses without power, many of them possibly for weeks to come. The double blow left Florida reeling, and there will be no quick recovery. \u201cJust when you started getting a little bit of normalcy after Helene, when things started to maybe stabilize, you turned around and had to deal with this other menacing storm, Hurricane Milton,\u201d Florida\u2019s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, said on Friday at yet another of a furious succession of briefings he has conducted over the last two weeks in the most affected areas. \u201cAs I said, there\u2019s damage. There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s going to need to be done. We did not get the worst-case scenario, but we did get hit, and we\u2019re going to have to work to bounce back.\u201d DeSantis was talking about both the immediate response to the back-to-back disasters, and the longer-term recovery that Florida\u2019s experience as the nation\u2019s most vulnerable state to hurricanes has shown will be lengthy and costly. Even as water rescues continue and flooding from Milton persists this weekend, early estimates are already in. Analysts at AccuWeather calculate a preliminary total of $160bn to $180bn in damage and economic losses for what they say is \u201cone of the most damaging and impactful storms in Florida history\u201d. By comparison, the inflation-adjusted cost of the most expensive hurricane in US history, Katrina in 2005, was $320bn, the company said. Milton will be so expensive partly because of its extensive reach: an EF3 tornado, one of dozens spawned in the storm\u2019s outer bands, destroyed more than 100 homes in the upmarket Avenir development in Palm Beach Gardens, about 170 miles east of where Milton made landfall on Siesta Key. \u201cA $225-$250bn loss from Helene and another $160-180bn from Hurricane Milton is close to almost half a trillion dollars. The GDP of the US is $26tn, so this combined loss is nearly 2% [of that],\u201d Joel Myers, founder and executive president of AccuWeather, said in the estimate. The losses, he said, will be mainly focused in the fourth quarter of this year, and the first quarter of 2025. \u201cThat may wipe out all expected growth in the economy over that period,\u201d he said. There are more immediate concerns at state level, including how Helene and Milton might affect the smooth running of next month\u2019s general election. County elections supervisors and their staffs have been assessing damage to buildings. DeSantis signed a number of executive orders after Hurricane Helene loosening voting rules to ensure as many people as possible could cast their ballot. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any offices that have been affected so badly they\u2019re not operational, I think the only thing they\u2019re looking at right now is power, the actual buildings are OK,\u201d said Travis Hart, president of the Florida Supervisors of Elections organization that represents supervisors in all 67 counties. \u201cWe haven\u2019t compiled everything yet, and some are out right now checking their polling places and polling sites. But I\u2019m feeling really good that they\u2019re going to be in pretty good shape.\u201d Hart said he expected DeSantis would approve consolidation of some polling sites in newly affected areas, as he did following Helene. Other measures include a relaxation of strict training requirements for poll workers, and allowing residents, as well as first responders and utility workers working far from their homes, to change addresses for mail-in voting by phone. \u201cA lot of people are being displaced, maybe their homes are damaged, they can\u2019t get back to them, and along the coast some of them have been swept away,\u201d Hart said. \u201cThey can just call us and say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m at this address now if you\u2019d please send my vote-by-mail ballot here\u2019, they don\u2019t have to go print out a form and mail it to us, bring it in or email it.\u201d Hart said the state\u2019s long history of disruptive hurricanes had taught election officers to be prepared, although he conceded that major storms in quick succession might present a different set of challenges. \u201cThat\u2019s one good thing about Florida, we\u2019ve been here before. We kind of operate on the unprecedented, we\u2019re resilient, we will bounce back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this one may present new problems. Hurricanes are like elections, every one is different. From early reports it\u2019s not as bad as we were anticipating, but who knows, when the full assessments come back we may have to shift gears and go another direction.\u201d Another area where experts say the hurricanes could have significant long-term impact is Florida\u2019s thriving real estate market. Previous storms have not slowed a steady stream of about 900 people a day moving into the sunshine state, but an enduring insurance crisis worsened by an inevitable new round of premium hikes following Helene and Milton might. Analysts say it is too soon to predict how things will play out, but even if prices rise and demand softens, there will probably still be no shortage of people willing to come. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are people in Florida thinking, \u2018This is it, I\u2019m moving,\u2019 and people that have been considering moving to Florida thinking, \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to go, there\u2019s just too many hurricanes\u2019,\u201d said Ken Johnson, chair in real estate at the University of Mississippi\u2019s school of business. \u201cBut still, en masse, the in-migration is not going to turn around. All the past evidence suggests, after hurricanes, there\u2019s economic growth in the area. There\u2019s momentum for business capital to come in, and folks do still want to retire to Florida.\u201d Johnson, however, believes the latest disasters will put pressure on the Florida legislature to fix the broken insurance market. Several private insurance carriers have left Florida in recent years, and the number of policies held by Citizens, the state-backed insurer of last resort, has ballooned. \u201cWhen the needle gets moved it\u2019s going to be from an event, or set of events like we\u2019ve just had,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo hurricanes in two weeks is the kind of thing that will perhaps finally trigger some real action. It\u2019s something Florida\u2019s going to need to do, and I think they are going to do it, I just don\u2019t know when.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-30T11:00:07Z",
            "content": "If elected, Donald Trump plans to carry out \u201cthe largest deportation operation in American history\u201d. After pushback on Joe Biden\u2019s border policies, Kamala Harris has embraced border restrictions and the need to maintain limits on asylum seekers. But neither candidate captures the realities of US immigration. US consumers are accustomed to cheap goods and services, and the economic rationale for large-scale immigration has been largely avoided. In a country that relies on a mobile, low-cost workforce, the loss of migrant workers would trigger productivity losses and a new round of inflationary pricing pressure. \u201cIt would be an economic disaster for America and Americans,\u201d says Zeke Hernandez, an economics professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, of Trump\u2019s deportations threat. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the immigrants would be harmed, but we, the people of America, would be economically harmed.\u201d Baby boomers are retiring, and with fewer immigrants, the workforce will struggle to sustain economic output: US employers will need to hire 240,000 people a month for the next five years just to replace those who are stepping out, according to one recent study. Hernandez, author of a recent book, The Truth About Immigration, argues that immigrants contribute talent, investment, innovation, consumption and tax revenue. \u201cIf you lose those things, there are fewer jobs, the economy contracts and becomes less diversified.\u201d Of the undocumented migrants, between 8 and 9 million are in the workforce doing essential jobs that Americans disproportionately don\u2019t want to do or work in sectors where there aren\u2019t enough workers. Typically, that\u2019s farm work (one third of the labor force), construction work (about one quarter) and about half of the labor force in skilled work like drywalling, plumbing and insulation. \u201cUndocumented immigrants make up a huge proportion of household services, manufacturing work, kitchen staff in restaurants. Americans simply do not do those jobs, or there are not enough to go around. But if you lose those key \u2018bottleneck\u2019 workers, the native workforce also can\u2019t do their jobs,\u201d says Hernandez. A study by the Center for Migration Studies estimates undocumented workers contribute $97bn in federal, state and local taxes, their removal from the workforce would have a substantial impact on local economies, including pushing nearly 10 million US citizens into economic hardship. Families would also be profoundly impacted. About 5.8m US households are home to at least one undocumented resident and mass deportations would break up nearly 5m US families. The cost of bringing up US-born children whose caregivers are removed has been put at $116bn. Taxpayers would have to foot the bill. Apprehending and deporting just 1 million of an estimated 11 million-12 million undocumented migrants in the US could cost taxpayers about $20bn, or $19,599 per person, according to a CBS News analysis of federal data \u2013 and take far longer than the term of a four-year Trump administration. Business leaders have been fairly quiet on Trump\u2019s plans \u2013 possibly fearing retribution \u2013 but some lobby groups have begun to tally the costs of mass deportation. The construction sector employs an estimated 1.5 million undocumented workers, or 13% of its total workforce \u2013 a larger share than any other, according to data the Pew Research Center. Construction firms, already facing labor shortages, are warning that the loss of immigrant workers would push new home prices higher. The National Association of Home Builders considers foreign-born workers, regardless of legal status, \u201ca vital and flexible source of labor\u201d. The CEO of the NAHB, Jim Tobin, told NBC that their loss would be \u201cdetrimental to the construction industry and our labor supply and exacerbate our housing affordability problems\u201d. The Business Roundtable notes that \u201cimmigrants have always been a key part of America\u2019s innovative spirit. A vast majority of economists and business leaders agree that immigration is a net positive for the US economy\u201d but says \u201cthe system for welcoming these highly valuable workers is broken\u201d. A 2023 study of previous efforts at mass deportation, such as President Barack Obama\u2019s Secure Communities program from 2008 to 2014 that resulted in the deportation of almost half a million people, found that any benefits from reduced job competition that US-born workers face were counteracted by a decline in labor demand due to an increase in labor costs. \u201cPolice-based enforcement policies aimed at reducing the number of undocumented immigrants should consider the potential negative spillover effects on the labor market outcomes of immigrants who remain in the US and on US-born workers,\u201d a University of Denver study concluded. The same effect was seen during the Trump and Biden administrations when the Covid pandemic caused about a million fewer immigrants to enter the US leading to labor shortages and reduced output, and contributing to inflationary pressure. The post-pandemic spike in immigration contributed to inflation coming down, according to Hernandez. \u201cImmigration allowed business to hire again and raise output to what the market demands, so prices normalized,\u201d he says. Nevertheless opponents of immigration have been \u201cvery effective at flooding the zone with false or dubious claims\u201d, said Hernandez. Biden\u2019s policies, which Harris is now walking back, have created complications for the Latino communities in the US, resulting in declining support for Democrats and a frantic late-campaign effort to shore up their votes. In 2012, Latino support for Obama was at 71%. Eight years later Biden won 62%. A recent Times/Siena poll found Harris with 56%. According to Ana Valdez, president and CEO of the Latino Donor Collaborative, says the negative myths around Latino immigration are just \u201cpure rhetoric \u2026 Trump knows that most of the workforce the US needs to continue growing comes from Latinos.\u201d Valdez cites labor department statistics that show Latino workers in the labor force have grown from 10.7 million in 1990 to 29 million in 2020, and are projected to reach 36 million in 2030. In 2030, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects they will account for one out of every five workers in the labor force, at 21.2%, or or 78% of net new workers by 2030. Without those immigrant workers, the change in the standard of living for the middle class would be much more dramatic, Valdez says. \u201cThe reason we have avocados or chicken to choose from every day is because of immigration.\u201d Valdez, who worked in the Clinton administration, cites figure that show US Latinos generate $3.6tn in GDP and says the political discourse around the issue by both parties has equated all Latinos to undocumented immigrants and does not reflect the economic, data-backed reality. \u201cIf Trump and Harris want to win the Latino vote, and if the winner wants to keep our support once they\u2019re in office, they need to change their perspective and messaging to Latinos and recognize the full scope of our economic contributions,\u201d she says. \u201cNot doing so is reckless for their campaigns and the US economy.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-20T10:00:41Z",
            "content": "From the north, motorists pull into Scranton via the Joseph R Biden Jr Expressway. Cutting through the scenic Pocono Mountains, now at the start of autumn color season, they are greeted with a towering, electric billboard, blaring an encapsulating \u2013 if divisive \u2013 message to this working-class town: \u201cDemocrats for Trump,\u201d it reads. \u201cEconomy,\u201d it continues, with a green checked box next to the word. The sign in Biden\u2019s hometown is the perfect fall 2024 welcome mat in this crucial swing state filled with voters whose economic anxiety or satisfaction will decide next month\u2019s election. The US has staged a remarkable recovery since the pandemic and Biden has successfully pursued an economic agenda, Bidenomics, that should benefit Scranton and the state \u2013 $13bn has been earmarked from his infrastructure bill for repairing highways and bridges alone. But poll after poll shows deep-seated worries about the economy \u2013 worries that could sink Democrats\u2019 chances of keeping the White House come November. Like many mid-sized upper midwest cities that have faced post-industrial decline, Scranton, a longtime Democratic stronghold, has grown more conservative in recent elections. With the city\u2019s native son leaving office, and pocketbook issues top of mind, some believe Trump could finally take Scranton \u2013 a more-than-symbolic win. But with Kamala Harris, Biden\u2019s successor, and Donald Trump tied in the polls, guessing who will take Scranton, Pennsylvania, and the White House is a fool\u2019s errand. And this politically split town shows why the race is so close. On the street, one person\u2019s economic reality may be entirely different to the next. The complicated political mix of fears about the local economy, faith and mistrust in both Harris and Trump and shifting political allegiance was evident at the Marketplace at Steamtown, a downtown mall filled with local mom-and-pop shops. Pete, 78, a swing voter who declined to provide his last name, said inflation had been a problem over the last four years, but added prices were coming down, the stock market was high, and said he didn\u2019t blame Biden for the economic challenges. \u201cEvery president is stuck with what happened before, and the pandemic happened, so Biden was in a hole to begin with,\u201d Pete said. But the veteran added the main issue driving him to Harris was Trump disrespecting veterans: \u201cHe called us suckers and losers.\u201d The argument for Trump\u2019s economics is ironclad, said Lori Higgins with a scoff: \u201cLook at the last four years \u2013 everyone is paying more for everything. What more do you need to know to make a decision?\u201d Now 52, she voted for Democrats until Trump convinced her to switch sides in 2016. Even on the most basic details, there is disagreement: Pete said he had just paid $2.99 for gas, citing it as evidence that inflation was coming under control. Two Trump supporters said they paid as much as $3.50 for gas, evidence, they said, that inflation is still squeezing Scranton. Trump and Harris have made close to 50 visits to Pennsylvania so far this election cycle and poured nearly $1bn into ads \u2013 a record spend that reflects how crucial its 19 electoral votes, the biggest prize of any battleground, make the keystone state. Trump made his second visit to Scranton in as many months last week. \u201cGo get everyone you know and vote immediately,\u201d he urged rallygoers. But persuading any part of the deeply divided electorate to swap their vote looks difficult. Harris may yet hold Scranton, said Berwood Yost, a Pennsylvania pollster, but that is \u201csurprising\u201d given the level of economic discontent in the city and the county. \u201cThe dissatisfaction with Biden is really high and views on personal finances are very negative, so Trump should be clearly ahead,\u201d Yost said. And yet polling averages show Harris ahead by a point in Pennsylvania, (firmly within the margin of error) which \u201cspeaks in part to some voters\u2019 concerns about Trump and his personal character\u201d. Since 2000, Democrats have won the county with as much as 63% support, but Hillary Clinton narrowly won with less than 50% of the 2016 vote. Biden\u2019s home-field advantage may have buoyed Dems in 2020 \u2013 he was born and raised in Scranton until the age of 10, when his family moved to Delaware, and he has name-checked the city throughout his long career and is still nicknamed \u201cPennsylvania\u2019s third senator\u201d. Biden beat Trump in the county by 53.7% to 45.3%. Still, Scranton has become \u201cground zero for demonstrating the appeal of Trump and the Maga movement, and places that traditionally voted Democrat and ended up changing their stripes in a significant way\u201d, Yost said. \u2018Way more optimistic\u2019 Once a powerhouse city in the nation\u2019s coal capital, Scranton\u2019s economy is now driven by small business, retail, healthcare, education and the service sector, said Satyajit Ghosh, a University of Scranton economist. Though there is no shortage of empty storefronts downtown, it is noticeably livelier than many similar Rust belt urban cores. University of Scranton\u2019s surveys of downtown businesses found owners in April had concerns about the current economic climate but were decidedly more optimistic about the next six months: \u201cWay more optimistic than they were a year ago,\u201d Ghosh said. Yost\u2019s most recent polling put Harris up three points statewide and found the economy to be the top issue for 34% of residents. Other recent polling found 60% of Pennsylvanians said their economic situation was worse compared with 40% who say it was better or no different. James Simrell is part of the latter group. As he closed up his boxing gym in Steamtown, the lifelong Democrat was upbeat about Scranton\u2019s economy. His gym is just one of his three businesses, and all stay busy \u2013 he also designs jewelry and runs a small farm that produces butternut squash and pumpkins. He sells pumpkins to Blackwatch Cafe, and squash to Abe\u2019s Delicatessen, which uses it in their soup. \u201cEveryone is doing well,\u201d Simrell said. In contrast, the Trump economy was \u201cfalling apart\u201d as the former president left office amid a poorly managed pandemic, Simrell said. He has other reasons for not voting for Trump. His two adopted children are Black and Trump is \u201ca little bit prejudiced \u2013 it drives my wife crazy\u201d. Echoing longtime Democratic voters\u2019 sentiment, he added: \u201cMy mom and dad were Democrats and I follow what they believe, and Kamala\u2019s the best person to be president \u2013 she\u2019s not crazy.\u201d But lingering inflation is still a drag for Eric Flesher, who runs a collectibles and vintage store, Rock-N-Models. He likened the economy to a \u201ctightening sphincter\u201d. He declined to talk about politics, but said everything remained expensive: \u201cI\u2019m in a business that sells stuff that nobody needs unless they have disposable income, so it gets much more difficult\u201d when there is inflation, Flesher said. Flesher added that he disagreed with the \u201cmindset here that I should vote for someone because that\u2019s how my mom and dad voted \u2013 then you\u2019re just voting for a party and not a person\u201d, he added. \u2018She\u2019s not the kind you can trust\u2019 The economic indicators in Scranton track those of the wider US. Inflation, which peaked at an annual rate of 9.1% in mid-2022, has eased to 2.4%. Prices are similarly down in Scranton, the economist Ghosh said. Seasonally adjusted unemployment in the region was 3.9% in August, below the 4.2% national average. \u201cIn this area, which I\u2019ve covered for many years, I really haven\u2019t ever seen this strong of a performance in terms of employment,\u201d said Ghosh. Still, there\u2019s an after-effect of inflation that consumers feel, Ghosh added, and some high prices, like those for rent or food, are still hurting. Outside a Walmart in Dickson City, a retail hub just north of Scranton, husband and wife John and Carol Gardner still feel the pinch. The Mount Cobb residents used to pay $150-$200 a month on groceries, and now they pay twice that. Carol is out of a job on disability, while John assembles buffet trays for $12 an hour to make ends meet, even though he said he should be retired. \u201cTrump at least made sure we could go shopping, and Biden is making sure we can\u2019t,\u201d Carol said. \u201cI hope the lady doesn\u2019t get in because we\u2019re going to go straight downhill \u2013 she\u2019s not the kind you can trust.\u201d The view is different at Bethel AME, a 153-year old Black church on downtown\u2019s west side. Pastor Mark Alexander sees an improving economy, and blames inflation on Trump. \u201cInflation was more so because of Covid, and how the former president handled that situation, because when you have supply chain interruptions and poor leadership guiding the nation, it exacerbates things,\u201d he said. The Federal Reserve, not the president, decides rates, Alexander noted, and he pointed to low unemployment, the Chips Act \u2013 which is pouring billions into domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductors \u2013 and Biden\u2019s infrastructure bill as evidence of the president\u2019s economic success. Moreover, at Bethel AME, there is \u201cexcitement for someone who looks like us and has experienced some of things we have gone through and comes from a middle-class upbringing\u201d, Alexander added. \u201cAs opposed to a billionaire who has no clue what it is like day to day for middle-class people,\u201d he said. That\u2019s especially true with younger people because Harris \u201cspeaks their language\u201d, Alexander added. For others, neither candidate is appealing. Mike Gilson owns a flooring business, a maintenance company, and manages artists and chefs. He said the economy was strong locally because its economic backbone was made up of longtime small businesses, and it fared better during the last session than most other areas because of that composition. But the city\u2019s relatively strong economic standing is not persuading Gilson to vote for Harris. He said the president was a \u201cceremonial position\u201d and big corporations run the nation. \u201cIf the president actually wielded the power that people think they do then voting would make a lot more sense to me,\u201d Gilson said. History will decide which of Scranton\u2019s many voices will decide this election. Right now it is unclear whether the legacy of the city\u2019s most famous son will be enough to carry Harris over the line or finally hand Scranton and the state to Trump. With the race essentially a toss-up at this point, the key for either party is going to be turnout, Yost said. But in that battle, Trump may have an advantage \u2013 people who are less likely to vote have in recent elections voted for Trump. \u201cDemocrats have to counter that by getting their voters to the polls,\u201d Yost said. \u201cThink about the election as a mosaic \u2013 there are many pieces and some are bigger than others, but they\u2019re all going to matter.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-14T13:58:30Z",
            "content": "Government emergency workers in the US responding to the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene in North Carolina were relocated over the weekend amid concerns that \u201carmed militia\u201d could pose a threat to their safety. According to an email obtained by the Washington Post, a US Forest Service official sent out a message warning that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) \u201chas advised all federal responders Rutherford County, NC, to stand down and evacuate the county immediately\u201d. The message said that soldiers with the national guard \u201chad come across x2 trucks of armed militia saying there were out hunting FEMA\u201d. The Appalachian county of Rutherford incorporates the mountain towns of Rutherfordton, Forest City and Chimney Rock, which were badly hit by Helene floodwaters that tore away homes, washed out roads and killed dozens. The politicization of the response to Helene and later Milton has provided a recruitment opportunity for white supremacist groups who have assembled in devastated regions that government emergency services have struggled to reach as part of a recruitment drive and PR effort. Fema has also long been a target of unfounded anti-government conspiracy theorists \u2013 especially on the US\u2019s far right \u2013 going back more than a decade. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that white nationalist groups, including Patriot Front, had joined recovery efforts in Florida and in the Carolinas. An X post from western North Carolina read: \u201cWe in Patriot Front are here to help out the local communities \u2026 Our politicians can hem and haw and switch over quickly to their talking points about Israel, but we truly are supporting our communities and being America first.\u201d A Guardian report from 2020 described people in Corbett, Oregon, being stopped at armed civilian checkpoints and asked to identify themselves during wildfires, sparking a debate about vigilante activity and how law enforcement should respond. The Forest Service email, since confirmed to be authentic according to the Washington Post, said that incident management teams \u201chave been notified and are coordinating the evacuation of all assigned personnel in that county\u201d. A Forest Service official said Helene responders moved to a \u201csafe area\u201d and some emergency response work in that area had been paused on Saturday before resuming a day later. Fema had reportedly responded to the threats by ceasing to go door-to-door and instead were operating from fixed locations. \u201cFor the safety of our dedicated staff and the disaster survivors we are helping, Fema has made some operational adjustments\u201d, an anonymous official told the Post. In the weeks since Helene hit the region, US government officials have battled misinformation, including conspiracy theories that the hurricane was manipulated by the government in part to force people off their land to make way for lithium mining projects. Federal officials co-ordinating the Helene response have been subjected to antisemitic attacks that travel alongside anti-government conspiracy theories, according to a report by the non-profit Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD). Tensions between residents and government emergency workers resulted in harassment, Riva Duncan, a former Forest Service official in the area, including some being told: \u201cWe don\u2019t want the government here\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible because a lot of these folks who need assistance are refusing it because they believe the stuff people are saying about Fema and the government,\u201d Duncan told the Post. \u201cAnd it\u2019s sad because they are probably the ones who need the help the most.\u201d The tensions come as aid groups have flooded the area of western North Carolina. A resident reportedly threatened Fema personnel stationed in a trailer next to a supplies distribution center manned by the Cajun Navy Relief organisation and the Baptist church. Local police confirmed the incident. Anti-government sentiment and disinformation have spread far beyond Appalachia, with the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, accused of echoing misinformation for political gain. Some Republicans have even claimed the US government can control the weather, triggering widespread condemnation, especially by local Republican figures. In remarks to a North Carolina church congregation on Sunday, the vice-president, Kamala Harris, issued a veiled condemnation of the phenomenon. \u201cThere are some who are not acting in the spirit of community and I am speaking of those who have been literally not telling the truth, lying, about people who are working hard to help those in need. Spreading disinformation when the truth and fact are required. \u201cThe problem,\u201d Harris added, is that \u201cit\u2019s making it harder to get people lifesaving information if they\u2019re led to believe they cannot trust. And that is the pain of it all, because the idea that those in need are somehow being convinced that the forces are working against them in a way that they would not seek aid.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-26T19:03:28Z",
            "content": "Labour will launch a new era of public and private investment in hospitals, schools, transport and energy as momentous as any in the party\u2019s history in this week\u2019s budget, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said. In an interview with the Observer before the first budget by a female chancellor, Reeves draws comparisons with Labour\u2019s historic reform programmes begun in 1945 by Clement Attlee, in 1964 under Harold Wilson and in 1997 under Tony Blair. \u201cThis is only the fourth time that Labour has gone from opposition into government,\u201d she says. \u201cIn 1945, we rebuilt after the war; in 1964, we rebuilt with the \u2018white heat of technology\u2019; and in 1997, we rebuilt our public services. We need to do all of that now.\u201d Reeves will, however, face huge controversy amid claims that she will break at least the spirit of Labour\u2019s election promises when she announces \u00a340bn of tax rises and spending cuts that will include an increase of up to 2% in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) and a likely further freeze in income tax thresholds beyond 2028. Such a freeze on thresholds \u2013 which Reeves described last year as \u201cpicking the pockets of working people\u201d when the same policy was reannounced by the Tories \u2013 will drag 400,000 people into paying tax for the first time and 600,000 into doing so at a higher rate. Before the election, Labour ruled out any increases in income tax, national insurance and VAT on \u201cworking people\u201d. In the interview, Reeves claims that she is in fact keeping to her election pledges in full, as people will not see their taxes rise immediately after the budget and national insurance rises will not directly affect employees. \u201cThe day after the budget, people are not going to see those main taxes that they pay \u2013 income tax, national insurance, VAT \u2013 going up \u2026 We promised at the election that we wouldn\u2019t put up those taxes for working people. \u201cOne of the things that has eroded trust in politics and politicians has been a failure to stick to manifesto commitments. We don\u2019t want to be that sort of government, I don\u2019t want to be that sort of chancellor.\u201d But Jeremy Hunt, the shadow chancellor, said that raising employer NICs was a \u201cjobs tax that is paid by working people\u201d, which would mean \u201cfewer jobs and lower wages\u201d, as employers would pass on the effects to those they employed in the form of lower wages or redundancies. He cited the Institute for Fiscal Studies as saying the rise would be a \u201cstraightforward breach\u201d of promises. While she is bound to face a backlashes over tax rises, Reeves is determined to portray the budget as the launch of a period of huge \u201cnational renewal\u201d that will tackle the legacy of chaos left by the Tories \u2013 a \u00a322bn black hole in current spending \u2013 through tough decisions on tax, while changing the fiscal rules to allow \u00a350bn of extra borrowing for capital projects to reverse a decline in infrastructure across the public sphere. As part of the twin-track approach, \u00a31.4bn will be directed towards \u201crebuilding crumbling schools\u201d, with 50 schools rebuilt a year. Hospital rebuilding projects are expected to be announced alongside these in the budget. Reeves says such schemes would not be possible without changing the fiscal rules, and makes clear she expects the Tories to oppose such changes in the aftermath of the budget. Sensing the opportunity to open a new dividing line with the Conservatives, Reeves says: \u201cIf they oppose our new fiscal rules next week, they will basically be saying they support the current path of decline. We are happy to have that debate. We are on the right side of it.\u201d She adds: \u201cI think the big divide in politics after this is going to be whether you are in favour of investment or whether you are in favour of decline. \u201cWe inherited a plan from the previous government in which public sector net investment, capital investment, would be falling sharply over the course of this parliament, and that would mean scores of hospitals not built. It would mean massive opportunities to grow our economy in the digital and energy sector would be missed and those jobs would go elsewhere.\u201d She spells out how she sees two types of investment as crucial to transforming the country, as a direct result of reforming borrowing rules. The first will be projects that \u201ccrowd in\u201d big private sector investment alongside public funding, such as the plan recently announced for \u00a321bn of public investment in carbon capture and storage alongside billions of pounds of private investment. There will be other such public-private models in the energy, digital, science and transport sectors, to be announced in the budget. The second type of investment will be in \u201cthe public realm\u201d, with the rebuilding of urgently needed schools and hospital buildings. New and developing industries also offer huge opportunities that invite investment, she says. \u201cThis is a new settlement on Wednesday to rebuild our country and seize the massive opportunities in technology and energy that are out there. There is a global race on for those jobs and we need to seize them for Britain. If we can unlock that investment, public and private, then we can do great things as a country again.\u201d Reeves says that while she will not be lifting the two-child benefit cap that is blamed for plunging thousands more young people into poverty, she will be taking other actions to alleviate child poverty. \u201cWe are a good Labour government, and good Labour governments lift children out of poverty and fix the National Health Service. I hope that people can see that I am starting to turn the corner.\u201d"

Most striking of all was its musical diversity, a meld of jazz, soul and hip-hop. Who We Are pursues the same innovative grail and at a likewise generous 14 tracks. The mood is almost relentlessly upbeat, borne along on Henry\u2019s love of plunging chords and funky riffs. Opener Love Is Like a Movie is a case in point, a droll romantic call beautifully sung by Judi Jackson, after which come Take It Higher, whose strings and massed vocals recall Nuyorican Soul, and the title track, a plea for a slower, more collective lifestyle. Nina Simone\u2019s Mississippi Goddam gets the same widescreen treatment, and while Henry\u2019s lush falsetto doesn\u2019t have the muscle to nail home Simone\u2019s anger, he makes up for it with keyboard cascades.

            "date": "2024-10-28T11:00:04Z",
            "content": "Africa has the greatest variety in human genes anywhere on the planet but the world is failing to capitalise on it, according one of the continent\u2019s leading scientists, Prof Kelly Chibale, a man determined to change that. He believes the birthplace of humanity could hold the scientific key to its future. About 18% of the global population lives in Africa \u2013 a proportion set to rise over the next few decades \u2013 and it accounts for 20% of the global disease burden. But only 3% of clinical trials take place on the continent, and most of those in just two countries \u2013 South Africa and Egypt. \u201cI would argue that actually, if you really want to have confidence in a clinical trial, it must start in Africa. Why? If it works in Africa, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019ll work somewhere else, because there is such huge genetic diversity,\u201d says Chibale, of the University of Cape Town. Genetic differences affect how drugs are processed by the body. They might pass through more quickly, meaning a standard dose is not enough, or more slowly, risking a toxic overdose. Testing a drug in people with a wider variety of genes, rather than the historic standard of a Caucasian man, means the frequency and amount of a drug given to patients can be better calibrated for everyone before it gets to market. Some global regulators now require genetic diversity in trials before they will approve medicines. It is an \u201copportunity\u201d, Chibale says, but will require persuading more African people to volunteer to take part in research, and governments will need to be more open to hosting trials. He says it is important that encouragement for more Africans to get involved comes from people such as him. There is deep mistrust in many communities because of medical abuses under colonial and apartheid regimes. If calls to participate come from non-African outsiders, people will think \u201cyou\u2019re trying to use us as guinea pigs\u201d, he says. \u201cPeople have been traumatised. But if I say it \u2013 because I come from there and I know this is the truth. Who says it, matters.\u201d The 2023 recipient of the Royal Society\u2019s Africa prize, Chibale was in the UK at the institution earlier this month to give a lecture on tailoring medicines to African populations. He leads the H3D research centre at the University of Cape Town, a unit he founded in 2011, which is working on drugs to fight diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis, and combat antimicrobial resistance \u2013 conditions that predominantly affect people in Africa. \u201cAfricans have to take a lead in doing these things, because these are problems that affect us more,\u201d he says. \u201cThe status quo is that innovative medicines are discovered and developed largely in the global north. Then, five to 10 years later, those innovative medicines are brought to Africa.\u201d It means there is no certainty that those drugs will work in African populations, or fit into the way medicine is practised across the continent, Chibale says \u2013 offering as an example a greater reliance on traditional remedies as the first option, which can mean patients present to hospitals later than in western countries. \u201cYou have to do the discovery and development near to where the patients are, so you understand how to meet their pressing health needs in their social and physical environment.\u201d There are big challenges in conducting scientific research on the continent, Chibale concedes, and a need for African governments to bolster public health research infrastructure and smooth legislative and regulatory pathways. Efforts to increase drug manufacturing on the continent are welcome \u2013 it was \u201calmost embarrassing\u201d to have to seek ingredients from China or India for H3D\u2019s own trials, he says. \u201cEvery country has a right to prioritise their citizens [\u2026] if there are supply chain issues, you will be left behind.\u201d There are obvious health benefits for Africa if drugs are better tailored to local people, he says, as well as economic benefits. \u201cThey create jobs, they create infrastructure.\u201d And African institutions must step up as partners. \u201cIn any kind of partnership, you have to bring something to the table. You cannot just demand. It is not always about money: sometimes [you need] just the right policies, the right climate for business to flourish, the right climate for research.\u201d Chibale was born in rural Zambia, a 10-hour walk from a bus stop. His father died when he was two months old and he had a nomadic childhood, moving between townships for his mother to find work. He would study at night by the light of a homemade paraffin lamp in the tiny room he shared with his brother. He had malaria multiple times. \u201cEach time, I would go to the clinic for malaria medicines and get cured. Malaria is fatal if you don\u2019t get treatment. Two, three days \u2013 you\u2019re gone. But I took so much for granted. \u201cIt was only much later in life that I realised two things \u2026 [about the] malaria medicine that I used to take in the village \u2013 number one, someone somewhere invested money, millions in the discovery and development of the medicine. Number two, someone somewhere volunteered to participate in the clinical trial for my benefit.\u201d New structures such as Africa CDC (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention), and the African Medicines Agency are important, he adds, in addressing one of the obstacles to clinical trials in Africa: a lack of harmonised regulatory environments that can create a big market, such as the EU. Chibale believes it is down to scientists to make the business case for research. H3D brings in foreign investment from pharmaceutical companies and funders including the Gates Foundation and Medicines for Malaria Venture. And it has grown from an initial staff of five to 75, most of whom have PhDs. \u201cThese people would be either in the UK, or Europe, or the US if we didn\u2019t have that,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople move because they are looking for opportunities, but if we can create those opportunities where they are, then they won\u2019t make the move.\u201d Chibale studied chemistry in Zambia, then at Cambridge University in the UK on a scholarship. He and his peers saw education as a way out of poverty, he says. His return to Africa was a decision made \u201cfrom my spirit\u201d, although he could not work in Zambia. \u201cLike in many countries, there will be no infrastructure to allow me to practise. So it is wasted \u2013 it\u2019s throwing money down the drain \u2013 because you can train people, but you cannot retain them,\u201d he says. Today he wants to highlight Africa\u2019s scientific success stories, including his own. H3D took a candidate malaria drug through to phase 2 clinical trials, before safety signals in what, in frustration, he calls \u201cstupid rats\u201d forced them to pause. They can combat \u201cafro-pessimism\u201d, he believes, or a sense that scientific success is simply not possible on the continent. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t believe Africa could be a source of innovation. We\u2019ve shown that we can,\u201d he says."

The levy, endorsed by conservative and progressive economists, has survived multiple federal elections and a supreme court challenge. But this time, a persistent cost-of-living crisis and a pugnacious Conservative leader running on a populist message have thrust the country\u2019s carbon tax once more into the spotlight, calling into question whether it will survive another national vote. In 2018, Trudeau announced plans for the \u201cpan-Canadian climate framework\u201d, modelled after British Columbia\u2019s pioneering carbon tax. Notably, the levy is revenue neutral: the government doesn\u2019t keep any money. Instead, it remits all of it back to taxpayers in the form a quarterly rebate. Any increase in costs from a tax on fuel is offset by a rebate of roughly equal value. According to the federal government, a family of four in Ontario will receive C$1,120 (\u00a3630) this year in rebates. Those living in a rural community receive C$1,344. A rural family of four in the province of Alberta receives C$2,160. Anyone willing and able to change their behaviour would end up in the black. Economists, political scientists \u2013 and the parliamentary budget officer \u2013 have found low-income households receive more from the rebate than they pay in additional costs. But the Conservatives, with a significant lead in the polls, are keen to capture mounting frustration with the incumbent government and transform a federal vote into a referendum on Trudeau\u2019s marquee climate policy. Their campaign message, on billboards and T-shirts, has been simple: \u201caxe the tax\u201d. They argue that levy burdens Canadians at a time when rents, groceries and transportation costs have all surged. Kathryn Harrison, a political scientist at the University of British Columbia, who has spent years studying the effects of carbon levies on behaviour and emissions, laments the \u201coutright falsehoods\u201d peddled for political benefit. \u201cThe current political discourse means a lot of Canadians misunderstand how the policy affects them. They don\u2019t think it works. They think they\u2019re paying more than they are. And that\u2019s a very distressing thing for me, from not just a climate policy perspective, but a democratic perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a debate about how much emphasis to put on one issue or another. The unpopularity of the carbon tax is, to a large degree, driven by voters misunderstanding it and having the facts wrong.\u201d For Canada\u2019s environment minister, Steven Guilbeault, the fractious debate represents a crossroads for the country in addressing the effects of the climate crisis. \u201cThe reality is, it\u2019s easy to say \u2018axe the tax\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one likes to pay taxes. It is more complicated to explain that climate change is real, it\u2019s costing Canadians billions of dollars and carbon pricing is one of many measures we\u2019re putting in place to try and fight climate change. That\u2019s harder to communicate than a slogan.\u201d But the tenor of the debate \u2013 and the misinformation \u2013 also suggests something deeper is at stake. \u201cClimate, and more generally, the environment is now caught into this culture war where facts don\u2019t matter, where the truth has no currency,\u201d said Guilbeault. \u201cThis is an issue that speaks to the fundamental elements of our democracies around the world, many of which are being weakened by those campaigns of disinformation.\u201d Still, the perceived benefits of abandoning the tax have lured in other party leaders. Last month, the New Democratic party leader Jagmeet Singh suggested his support was waning because he doesn\u2019t want a policy that puts the \u201cburden on the backs of working people\u201d \u2013 a claim dismissed by experts. \u201cIt is surprising the federal NDP are turning their back on a very progressive policy that both reduces carbon pollution, but also delivers rebates greater than carbon payments for lower income households \u2013 the people he purports to be most supportive of,\u201d said Harrison. Guilbeault admits federal government was \u201ca bit slow\u201d in course-correcting the waves of misinformation surrounding the levy. \u201cWe could have done better, but the 2019 and 2021, and partially, the 2015 elections were fought in part on the issue of carbon pricing \u2013 and we won those elections,\u201d he said. \u201c Initially, the tax was remitted in the form of a tax cut that few people noticed when they filed their taxes. Later, the government began directly depositing the money \u2013 but couldn\u2019t get the banks to indicate the money was a rebate from the carbon tax. It took a change to the law that finally compelled banks to label government payments as the \u201cCanada Carbon Rebate\u201d or \u201cCdaCarbonRebate\u201d. As nations around the world unveil politics to blunt the effects of a rapidly changing climate, recent report from the Canadian Climate Institute found the national carbon levy, which targets both consumers and industry, is projected to reduce emissions by as much as 50% by 2030. In the event that a Conservative government abandons the national carbon levy, Canada will have \u201cno way\u201d of meeting its 2030 emissions targets,\u201d said Guilbeault, adding it \u201creduces our credibility\u201d when negotiating with other nations moving ahead with plans to lower emissions. Most of the debate right now is on the fuel charge the consumer-facing carbon price, with little focus on the industrial carbon tax, said Dale Beugin, vice-president of the Canadian Climate Institute, which \u201cdelivers three times the emissions reductions by 2030\u201d than the consumer component of the tax. Opposition party leaders, including Singh, have vaguely suggested strengthening the industrial part of the carbon tax to make up for the lost benefits of the consumer tax. \u201cBut the reality is, when you remove one policy \u2013 in this case, the consumer carbon tax \u2013 you\u2019re forced to pushing harder on other levers to go after emissions,\u201d said Beugin. \u201cAnd there aren\u2019t many sources \u2013 buildings, vehicles \u2013 that haven\u2019t been looked at yet.\u201d For Beugin, the debate underscores an uncomfortable reality about policies meant to unwind the sustained environmental damage from unfettered emissions. \u201cClimate policy isn\u2019t easy. It requires some effort to push against the things that are easy and simple politically, because that\u2019s this transformation that we need,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, technology is getting cheaper, but climate policy is inevitably hard \u2013 and you don\u2019t want to shy away from that.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-17T03:51:19Z",
            "content": "Ollie Olsen, the maverick Australian post-punk and electronic music innovator, died on Wednesday after a long struggle with multiple system atrophy, a rare neurological disease which he \u201cfought like a Viking\u201d, according to a statement shared on his social media accounts. He was 66. Olsen \u2013 who changed his name legally from Ian Christopher Olsen to Ollie Jngbert Christian Olsen in the early 90s \u2013 had been inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame earlier this month, with the organisation describing him as \u201ca true artist and visionary in every sense of the word\u201d. He was no chart-topper, but was deeply respected by musicians who bothered them more regularly; notably, the only time Michael Hutchence stepped outside INXS was to collaborate with Olsen. That was in 1986, when Richard Lowenstein tapped Olsen to be the music director for his film Dogs in Space. Hutchence, then at the absolute peak of his fame, played the lead. The film is a grimy look back at Melbourne\u2019s post-punk scene of the late 70s, of which Olsen was a central player in acts such as Whirlywirld and Young Charlatans. Hutchence recorded Olsen\u2019s song Rooms for the Memory for the soundtrack. The only piece of music recorded under Hutchence\u2019s own name during his lifetime, it reached Number 11 on the Australian charts early in 1987. Two years later, they collaborated again under the name Max Q, producing minor hits Sometimes and Way of the World. Olsen was born in Melbourne in 1958. His first band, the Reals, was one of Melbourne\u2019s first punk acts and featured future Sacred Cowboys singer Garry Gray. In late 1977, Olsen left to form Young Charlatans with guitarist Rowland S Howard, bass player Janine Hall and drummer Jeffrey Wegener. They were, writer Clinton Walker noted, a supergroup from the outset; Howard, Hall and Wegener would all go on to bigger things in the Birthday Party, the Saints and Laughing Clowns, respectively. Howard\u2019s classic Shivers was originally a Young Charlatans song, later recorded by the Birthday Party under their early name the Boys Next Door. But Olsen had perennially itchy feet. Moving away from guitars, he formed Whirlywirld, pushing into the much harder, synthesizer-based territory then occupied by New York pioneers Suicide and the UK\u2019s Throbbing Gristle \u2013 a sound Depeche Mode would spend the rest of their careers chasing and refining, with infinitely greater success. Whirlywirld played a grand total of 14 gigs as part of Melbourne\u2019s so-called \u201clittle band\u201d scene (Olsen initially refused to play live), releasing two EPs before Olsen relocated to London in 1980 on the recommendation of an impressed Iggy Pop. He later rerecorded several Whirlywirld songs for the Dogs in Space soundtrack. Olsen formed experimental outfit Hugo Klang in London, eventually returning to Australia in 1983. His next band, Orchestra of Skin and Bone, \u201cproved incomprehensible to local audiences\u201d, according to Australian music historian Ian McFarlane. Later came NO, an aggressive industrial act that anticipated Ministry; their sole full-length album was called Once We Were Scum Now We Are God (1989). Yet Olsen could still attract the biggest names to work with. With friend Troy Davies, he formed Ecco Homo, and Hutchence appeared in the clip for their first single Motorcycle Baby in 1988; in 1990, U2\u2019s Bono and the Edge guested on the second, New York New York. \u201cThey were on the Rattle and Hum tour, so they were wearing cowboy hats,\u201d Olsen drily observed. And his most radical move was still to come. In 1990 he formed Third Eye, which put him on the cutting edge of acid house and ambient techno. He released a cover of Russell Morris\u2019s epochal 60s flower-power anthem The Real Thing in late 1990; a 1993 album, Ancient Future, was as trance-inducing as anything by the Orb or KLF. By then, he had become a key figure in Melbourne\u2019s rave scene, a virtual deity to those aware of his history in the electronic music movement he had helped birth in Australia. Writer Chris Johnston told me, by email, that \u201che had the long hair and the robes and the beads back then, a gorgeous Svengali type of guy to the new young crew\u201d. His Psy-Harmonics and Psychic Harmonies labels provided an outlet for many of these like-minded younger artists. \u201cOllie was a great collaborator, he rarely did music alone,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cHe always had a mad squad of artists and misfits around him \u2013 he had a great knack of bringing people together.\u201d In his later life, Olsen composed film and television scores and performed guest lectures at various universities before retiring from music due to ill health. In 2023, Magic Dirt singer Adalita collaborated with Mick Harvey and Models\u2019 Andrew Duffield on a cover of Rooms for the Memory to raise funds towards his care. Olsen died peacefully with his wife Jayne, whom he married on 9 October, by his side. Among a flood of tributes from fellow musicians, Tony Buck \u2013 drummer and percussionist for internationally celebrated improvisational trio the Necks \u2013 described him simply as \u201cone of the greats\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 October 2024 to correct the release date of Adalita\u2019s collaboration with Mick Harvey and Andrew Duffield, and to clarify that Rooms for the Memory was the only piece of music recorded under Hutchence\u2019s own name during his lifetime. The headline was also amended to refer to Ollie Olsen by his legal name."

            "date": "2024-10-11T05:00:43Z",
            "content": "A group of young Kenyans are working on an unusual solution to the problems of food waste and fish feed produced unsustainably from wild-caught fish stocks: maggots. The larvae of the black soldier fly are now devouring unwanted food in projects around the world. Their excrement, known as frass, can be used as a fertiliser for land-based crops, and their protein-rich bodies, harvested before they turn into flies, can be fed to livestock. In Kenya, the environmentalists behind Project Mila, which in Swahili means tradition, are employing the larvae to clean up food waste, as well as nurture mangroves and feed fish in coastal farms. Project Mila\u2019s team of volunteers collect organic waste from households, markets and restaurants in the south-eastern coastal city of Mombasa, and feed it to voracious larvae, which produce frass while helping to clean up the city. Nusra Abed, co-founder of Project Mila and a community health promoter, says she was \u201cperturbed by the number of sanitation-related infections within the community due to poor waste management, and wanted to be part of the solution\u201d. According to a report by the UN Environment Programme, Kenya has some of the highest levels of household food waste in the world, producing 40-100kg per person annually. Apart from alleviating the problem of food waste, the frass fertiliser has also been helping small-scale farmers in the Mombasa area increase their crop growth and diversity. It can enable farmers to diversify away from planting coconuts \u2013 a commonly grown crop which is slow to mature \u2013 into fast-growing produce including onions, tomatoes and other fruits. This offers them the opportunity to earn extra income through farming that\u2019s sustainable and organic, and selling their surplus harvest in markets, says Roselyne Mwachia, a marine and fisheries researcher working with Project Mila. The use of frass in farming has also made the activity less harmful for the environment and improved the catch of nearby fishers, say the team. In areas like Mariakani and Mazeras, 24 miles west of Mombasa, upstream smallholder farmers were using chemical-based fertilisers before the switch to frass, which polluted the marine ecosystem when washed into the water after storms, says Mwachia. \u201cThis affected \u2026 marine species, as well as caused bleaching of coral reefs and death of mangroves, seagrass and seaweeds.\u201d \u201cCoral reefs are fertile breeding grounds for marine species, and when bleaching happens, it means breeding will be impacted and marine stocks will reduce,\u201d she adds. But with farmers shifting to frass, Mwachia says that \u201cfishers around areas where we have worked are reporting reduced coral bleaching and increased fishing fortunes due to reduced pollution\u201d. Globally, aquaculture has gained a bad reputation for its unsustainability, especially relating to the widespread practice of turning wild-caught fish into food for captive-bred fish. But making fish feed out of fly larvae can potentially reduce dependence on traditional fishmeal derived from wild stocks, notes Mary Opiyo, a senior aquaculture research scientist at KMFRI, a state body. \u201cThis is one way of promoting sustainable aquaculture and reducing overreliance on marine stock,\u201d she says. Kigen Compton is the founder of BioBuu, a company producing fish feed from black soldier fly larvae in Kenya and Tanzania. He says: \u201cWith easily accessible, available and affordable feeds, many farmers are shifting to sustainable aquaculture and moving away from wild fishing.\u201d The larvae have been catching on with aquaculture workers in other countries, too. In Colombia, rural populations are earning sustainable livelihoods through frass-fed insects that are being used as feed in fish farming, while a company in Finland says producing fish feed from the larvae is the \u201cperfect solution\u201d for future aquaculture. Researchers in the US recently made some calculations regarding the country\u2019s aquaculture industry. They found that if soldier fly protein was fed to salmon, trout and shrimp to the maximum extent without impairing the fish, 40,843 tonnes of wild fish could be spared every year in the US alone. There are some concerns about disease. David Mirera, a senior research scientist at KMFRI, says there are risks if proper hygiene guidelines are not followed during the production of the feed. \u201cWe do not have a clear regulatory framework and controls on black soldier fly rearing, and this might compromise the quality of feeds being produced, especially by those who are not professionals in the sector of feed formulation and production,\u201d he says. But many fish farmers in his country are already firm fans of the flies, citing their convenience and secure yields. Juma Mashanga is one of them. He helps lead a group of community fishers who are farming fish in cages in the Indian Ocean near Kwale, a town 19 milles south-west of Mombasa. \u201cWith cages, there is a guarantee of harvesting at maturity, and the returns are good,\u201d he says. \u201cSustaining the cages and feeding the fingerlings is manageable because we can process our [black soldier fly] protein feeds at home.\u201d This article was originally published on Dialogue Earth under the Creative Commons BY NC ND licence."

            "title": "Will the WSL global expansion impact English players\u2019 development?",
            "date": "2024-10-04T15:24:43Z",
            "content": "More than two-thirds of the players who have featured in the Women\u2019s Super League so far this season represent overseas countries, as the English top-flight continues to be an increasingly cosmopolitan league. Of the 203 different players who have appeared during a WSL match after two rounds of fixtures, only 62 are eligible to play for England, or 30.5%, according to data collated by the Guardian. Players representing 33 different countries have been named in a matchday squad for a WSL fixture this season, with players representing 30 nations having started at least one match. That is in stark contrast to the landscape in the WSL as little as seven years ago when players from only 15 countries were involved in the division and more than two-thirds of the players were English. The international flavour of the WSL no doubt has many benefits, not least in widening the broadcast appeal of the division across the globe, engaging fans on different continents and boosting sponsorship revenues. However, could it come at a cost to the development of young English players? At this summer\u2019s European Women\u2019s Under-19 Championship in Lithuania, England reached the semi-finals, but the squads of the other three semi-finalists \u2013 the Netherlands, France and the eventual winners, Spain \u2013 all had more competitive top-flight experience at senior clubs. Sixteen of France\u2019s squad played in a top flight league last season, compared to only four of the England squad. That led to the Football Association\u2019s women\u2019s technical director, Kay Cossington, saying in July: \u201cThe pathway is more accessible and there are more opportunities than ever before, but talent needs opportunity. The pipeline is bursting. We now need to solve that next part of the jigsaw, which is to provide those meaningful minutes.\u201d The relative of one teenage English player currently playing in the Women\u2019s Championship, and who did not wish to be named, told the Guardian they felt she had been overlooked in the summer transfer market by WSL clubs because of their collective desire to sign overseas talent instead. Meanwhile, an agent representing players from a variety of countries around Europe said the WSL is \u201cthe place all our players want to play\u201d largely because of the salaries on offer. English players are still the most commonly seen in the WSL, but 11 from the Netherlands and Japan have gained WSL minutes so far this season, alongside 10 from Sweden. Only one English player, Lotte Wubben-Moy, started for Arsenal against Manchester City in their opening league match. That was also true of Everton for their opener away at Brighton, in a game where the Merseyside club started the game with a lineup of 11 players from 11 different countries. Asked about this on Friday,Everton\u2019s Danish manager, Brian S\u00f8rensen, said: \u201cIt [the WSL] is the most attractive league in the world, together with the NWSL (National Women\u2019s Soccer League), in terms of fans, playing in big stadiums and also, at the end of the day, what they are getting paid, so that will attract a lot of good players. It\u2019s getting global, it\u2019s getting bigger and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to stop here, it\u2019s going to continue.\u201d Brighton\u2019s manager, Dario Vidosic, whose side host Aston Villa on Saturday, agrees, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s the best league in the world, so when you talk to the biggest players around the world, it\u2019s not that hard to convince them to come over.\u201d It should be noted that while 30.5% of the players who have got on the pitch so far are England-eligible, that percentage rises to exactly a third when entire matchday squads are taken into account; of the 246 different players who have been named in matchday squads, 82 are eligible to play for the Lionesses (33.3%). WSL clubs do have to adhere to a rule mandating that at least eight players in a first-team squad must be \u2018homegrown\u2019. That is defined as a player who, irrespective of their nationality or age, has been registered with a club in this country for three seasons, or 36 months, prior to their 21st birthday. The requirement for homegrown players is much higher in the Women\u2019s Championship, where a minimum of 15 homegrown players are required in a squad of 25, that number coming down if the squad is smaller. \u201cWhen I look at the Championship I see a lot of English players and I see a good level, which is only going to increase over the years,\u201d said S\u00f8rensen, whose side face Arsenal tomorrowon Sunday. \u201cBut it\u2019s a massive gap for young talent to just come in and compete [in the WSL]. If I compare it to the markets I know really well from Denmark, Sweden and Norway, then England is still in a very good place because the setups in all the clubs are really good. I\u2019m not worried about England, I think they\u2019re in a very good place.\u201d"

            "content": "Super League expanding to 14 teams as early as 2026 appears to be looming after the publication of IMG\u2019s gradings on Wednesday led to Wakefield being readmitted into the competition for 2025 in place of London Broncos, who have been demoted to the Championship. Rugby league clubs agreed last year to replace conventional promotion and relegation with a gradings system that measured clubs in a variety of on- and off-field metrics. The 12 clubs with the highest ranking would be admitted to Super League, with the gradings reviewed every year. However, the initial rollout of the system has already created several talking points. Chief among them is the return of Wakefield, who are back in Super League after a season away by securing the necessary grading points. The Broncos drop back into the Championship, the only change to the 2024 lineup. \u201cIt\u2019s a great achievement by everybody at the club,\u201d Wakefield\u2019s owner, Matt Ellis, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve bounced back and the score we\u2019ve received is the icing on the cake.\u201d Three-quarters of the competition, including Trinity, have secured the highest ranking of Grade A after they scored more than 15 points out of the maximum 20. St Helens were ranked first with 17.02, just ahead of the Super League champions, Wigan. The Rugby Football League and IMG said previously that expansion would be considered only when all 12 Super League sides achieved Grade A status. But Rhodri Jones, chief executive of Rugby League Commercial, said talks related to expansion will have to be brought forward. Jones said: \u201cBased on there being nine Grade As that conversation starts sooner than expected. \u201cThere is a chance we could have 12 Grade As next year and that will definitely quicken that conversation in a what\u2011if scenario, because it could be 2026. \u201cThere\u2019s a broader conversation to be had around the 14 teams. It\u2019s not a new conversation but we always said once we get to 12 Grade As we will review the structure in the top division.\u201d Any expansion to 14 would put four teams in contention: Toulouse, London, York and Bradford are the next highest-ranked teams outside Super League and they look to be in the mix for promotion should they sufficiently improve their points over the next year. The Broncos jumped from 24th last season to 14th in the new gradings. Any club with Grade A status is immune from relegation, meaning Trinity, Castleford and Leigh, who all scored 15 or more, are safe. The three Grade B clubs in Super League are Hull FC, Huddersfield and Salford. The Red Devils, who finished fourth on-field in 2024 but were ranked 12th by IMG, called for clarity on the system\u2019s nuances. The club said: \u201cWe believe that additional due diligence within the reporting system may be necessary to maintain a level playing field. As a community-owned club, we cannot rely on private equity to improve certain criteria, therefore achieving a Grade A status is critical to the future of the club, as well as the City of Salford.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-23T07:00:03Z",
            "content": "Azerbaijan, the host of the Cop29 global climate summit, will see a large expansion of fossil gas production in the next decade, a new report has revealed. The authors said that the crucial negotiations should not be overseen by \u201cthose with a vested interest in keeping the world hooked on fossil fuels\u201d. Azerbaijan\u2019s state-owned oil and gas company, Socar, and its partners are set to raise the country\u2019s annual gas production from 37bn cubic metres (bcm) today to 49bcm by 2033. Socar also recently agreed to increase gas exports to the European Union by 17% by 2026. The Cop29 summit, starting on 11 November, comes as scientists say that continued record carbon dioxide emissions means \u201cthe future of humanity hangs in the balance\u201d. The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that no new fossil fuel exploitation should take place if CO2 emissions were to fall to zero by 2050. But in 2023 Socar pushed 97% of its capital expenditure into oil and gas projects, the report found. The company launched a \u201cgreen energy division\u201d a few weeks after Azerbaijan was appointed as Cop29 host, promising investments in wind, solar and carbon capture technologies. But according to the report, Socar\u2019s renewable operations remain insignificant. Azerbaijan\u2019s climate action plan was rated \u201ccritically insufficient\u201d by Climate Action Tracker (CAT) in September. \u201cAzerbaijan is among a tiny group of countries that has weakened its climate target [and] the country is doubling down on fossil fuel extraction,\u201d said the CAT analysts. Azerbaijan and Socar had also been accused of human rights violations, the report said. The authors said defeating the climate crisis required civil society to have freedom of speech and protected human rights. \u201cGiven Socar\u2019s pivotal role in Azerbaijan\u2019s economy and its close ties to the country\u2019s political elite, its influence will surely be felt throughout the climate negotiations in Baku,\u201d said Regine Richter at the German NGO Urgewald, lead author of the report. \u201cAs we prepare for Cop29, we cannot but ask ourselves: did we put the fox in charge of the henhouse?\u201d Azerbaijan\u2019s president, Ilham Aliyev, told a climate conference in April: \u201cHaving oil and gas deposits is not our fault. It\u2019s a gift from God.\u201d Aliyez appoints Socar\u2019s management board and was vice-president of Socar until he succeeded his father as the country\u2019s president in 2003. Azerbaijan\u2019s ecology and natural resources minister, Mukhtar Babayev, will run Cop29. He previously worked for Socar for 26 years until 2018. Rovshan Najaf, the president of Socar, is part of the Cop29 organising committee. A Cop29 spokesperson, responding in relation to Azerbaijan\u2019s gas production and energy transition, said: \u201cAzerbaijan is investing in gas capacity in response to a European request to increase supplies following the disruption of supplies from Russia. This is in line with the [UN\u2019s] global stocktake, which agreed on the need to ensure that the energy transition is just and orderly.\u201d The global stocktake concluded the world was not on track to stop global heating and that \u201curgent and deep greenhouse gas emissions reductions\u201d were needed. The Cop29 spokesperson added: \u201cAzerbaijan is intensively developing its abundant solar and wind resources as part of its commitment to becoming a leading supplier of green energy.\u201d Neither Socar nor Azerbaijan\u2019s foreign affairs ministry responded to the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment. The new report, produced by Urgewald and CEE Bankwatch, found Azerbaijan was set to increase its gas production by a third in the next decade, with fossil fuel companies forecast to spend $41.4bn (\u00a331.9bn) on the country\u2019s gas fields. Socar alone spent almost $300m on exploration for new oil and gas between 2022 and 2024, according to the report. The analysis is based on data from Rystad Energy, the industry\u2019s leading provider. It includes current gas production, new resources approved for development, and other known resources. Burning of the expected gas production would produce about 780m tonnes of CO2, more than double the annual emissions of the UK. Rather than discovering more reserves, scientists concluded in 2021 that most existing gas reserves needed to remain in the ground to limit global heating to 1.5C. Socar works with some of the world\u2019s biggest fossil fuel companies, including BP, TotalEnergies, the Russian oil giant Tatneft and the United Arab Emirates\u2019 state oil company Adnoc. The CEO of Adnoc, Sultan Al Jaber, was president of Cop28 in Dubai, where nations failed to agree to \u201cphase out\u201d fossil fuels, as many wanted, instead choosing the weaker ambition of \u201ctransitioning away from fossil fuels\u201d. Socar also receives substantial financial backing from major international institutions, totalling $6.8bn in loans and underwriting between 2021 and 2023, according to research by the Banking on Climate Chaos coalition. Azerbaijan\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on fossil fuel income, which makes up 90% of export revenues and 60% of state revenues, according to the IEA. Azerbaijan\u2019s gas production was similar to that of the UK in 2022. Its oil production has declined since 2010. \u201cIt is crucial that those who host the [Cop29] negotiations are true climate leaders, not those with a vested interest in keeping the world hooked on fossil fuels,\u201d the report said. The report also highlighted accusations of human rights abuses and corruption in Azerbaijan. The European court of human rights found the country had violated the European convention on human rights 263 times since 2001, including three instances of torture and 30 cases of inhuman and degrading treatment. Freedom House ranks Azerbaijan among the least free countries in the world in relation to political rights, independent media and civil liberties, below Russia and Belarus. Transparency International rated Azerbaijan as the second-worst nation for public sector corruption in eastern Europe and central Asia in 2022. Socar has also been accused of human rights violations by the Azerbaijan-based Organization for the Protection of Oil Workers\u2019 Rights, which has cited health and safety violations and environmental pollution. Manana Kochladze at CEE Bankwatch said: \u201cWhere other governments partner with civil society to tackle the climate crisis, the Aliyev regime systematically threatens environmental and human rights defenders. This does not inspire confidence in the upcoming negotiations in Baku.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-08T14:00:03Z",
            "content": "Scientists have challenged Tanya Plibersek\u2019s claim that Australia is protecting more than half of its oceans and has \u201cblitzed\u201d a 30% target, arguing industrial longline fishing will still be allowed in some areas the government says it is conserving. The environment minister told a \u201cglobal nature-positive summit\u201d in Sydney on Tuesday the government had quadrupled the size of the sub-Antarctic Heard Island and McDonald Islands Marine Reserve, a world heritage area about 4,000km south-west of Perth. She said the more than 300,000 sq km expansion of the marine reserve meant Australia would be protecting 52% of its ocean territory, far more than the 30% target by 2030 the government signed up to as part of a global agreement in 2022. \u201cI\u2019m proud to say we\u2019ve blitzed our 30 by 30 target when it comes to oceans,\u201d she said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Scientists welcomed the expansion, but said much of the area newly included in the reserve was not protected at a level that met the definition agreed in the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework. Dr Ian Cresswell, a co-author of the last five-yearly federal State of the Environment report, said the announcement \u201ctook courage\u201d and was \u201ca really good step along the way\u201d but it was \u201cnot job done\u201d. \u201cAustralia should not say that we\u2019ve reached the target because we haven\u2019t,\u201d he said. The global biodiversity framework commits countries to ensure at least 30% of marine and coastal regions are \u201ceffectively conserved and managed\u201d as part of \u201cecologically representative\u201d protected areas by 2030. Cresswell, an adjunct professor at the University of Western Australia and former CSIRO research director for biodiversity, said Australia had reached about 25% of oceans protected under this definition. He said some of the newly protected areas were not particularly ecologically sensitive, while other areas that seabirds and marine mammals used for feeding and during breeding had been deemed \u201chabitat protection zone\u201d \u2013 a designation that bans trawling and mining but allows fishing using bottom longlines. \u201cThe system we have put in place is great, but it is not fully representative and misses some of the habitats we know should be protected,\u201d Cresswell said. Plibersek\u2019s 52% claim was made based on definitions of protected area used by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The IUCN lists seven categories, ranging from \u201cstrict nature reserve\u201d to \u201cprotected areas with sustainable use of natural resources\u201d. The government maps showing the expanded marine park said the areas described as \u201chabitat protection zone\u201d counted as an IUCN category four protected area, otherwise known as a \u201chabitat or species management area\u201d. Fiona Maxwell, a scientist and the Pew Charitable Trusts\u2019 national oceans manager, agreed with Cresswell. She also said it was great the protected area had been expanded, but added: \u201cWe are on the way to achieving our 30% target, but we are disappointed the government has used the 52% figure because it is misleading.\u201d On Wednesday, the minister planned to announce the government would strengthen protection across 73,000 sq km of sea in 14 marine parks in the country\u2019s south-east. The areas off the coast of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania are home to rare and protected species including pygmy blue whales and the southern elephant seal. Plibersek said the new protection included establishing 11 new \u201cno-take\u201d zones, a step that would lift 86% of the south-east park network into the highly protected category. Specific areas would be opened to \u201clow-impact sustainable fishing\u201d, but new deep-sea mineral mining and other industrial developments would be prevented. Vexed question hangs over nature summit The first day of the nature summit focused on the role of Indigenous leadership and knowledge in environment protection and the vexed question of how to pay to stop and reverse nature destruction. In Canberra, negotiations remain stalled in parliament over legislation that would create an environment protection agency and a second body to collect environmental data. The Coalition does not believe nature laws need to be strengthened. The Greens and independents want changes so that climate impacts are considered during development approvals and an effective legal exemption for state-run native forest logging is removed. The government has delayed a promised broader revamp of nature laws. The Greens\u2019 Sarah Hanson-Young said the nature-positive summit was \u201ca flop\u201d and accused the government of \u201ccaving to polluters and loggers\u201d, pointing to Plibersek\u2019s recent approval of three coalmine expansions. She blamed the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, for the stalled legislation. Plibersek told delegates at the summit they were \u201cat the start of the road when it comes to [being] nature positive and turning things around\u201d. \u201cOur job is not just to do the work, but to take others along with us [and] to build coalitions with unlikely allies as well as our traditional partners,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2024-10-13T13:37:51Z",
            "content": "Sky is likely to appeal against a planning decision blocking the expansion of its film studios, amid signs that the Labour government is willing to allow building on the green belt to prioritise economic growth. Sky Studios Elstree already has a new state-of-the art film and TV studio in Hertfordshire with 12 sound stages across 11 hectares (27.5 acres) , producing movies including Paddington in Peru and a version of the hit musical Wicked starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo. The company had proposed to expand its operations with a new development, Sky Studios Elstree North, with 10 new sound stages, which could create 2,000 new jobs and enable an extra \u00a32bn of production investment over the first five years of operation. It submitted a planning application to Hertsmere borough council in 2022 and in March the council narrowly rejected it. The media company now plans to appeal and hopes that Labour is looking more favourably on new film studio developments than the previous Conservative government as part of its backing for the UK\u2019s creative industries, which are largely clustered in the south-east. Sky Studios Elstree said: \u201cHaving taken the time to assess the plans and engage with the local council and community, it is our intention to submit an appeal.\u201d Hertsmere borough council said it had yet to receive a formal appeal but it has \u201chad notification of the applicant\u2019s intention to submit an appeal\u201d. Last week the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, called in a rejected planning application for a proposed \u00a3750m development at Marlow film studios that would create 4,000 jobs. Buckinghamshire council had turned down the application in May, citing concerns about the impact on the road network and use of the green belt. The Marlow project has received high-profile backing from film-makers including Sam Mendes and James Cameron. The site would have 44,000 sq metres (470,000 sq ft) of new sound stages. Ministers will now have the final say on whether the studio development is approved. Rayner has spoken of the need to shake up the planning system. A second film studio development is also hoping to overturn a planning decision on the green belt. Holyport Studios, a \u00a3100m scheme proposed by Greystoke Land, would provide 20,900 sq metres of soundstage space. The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead rejected the plans in March. The independent Planning Inspectorate, which deals with applications and appeals in England, is scheduled to hold an inquiry into the Holyport plans next month. Film studio space in the UK has nearly doubled in recent three years, from 297,000 sq metres in 2019 to 492,000 sq metres in 2022-23, according to UK government figures, and at the current rate of expansion Britain will be second only to Hollywood globally by the end of 2025."

            "title": "Eddie Howe faces watershed week with Newcastle\u2019s progress stalling | Louise Taylor",
            "date": "2024-10-26T13:00:33Z",
            "content": "As Sandro Tonali trudged towards the touchline Eddie Howe looked momentarily puzzled. Then comprehension dawned. As boos, albeit a gentle smattering, greeted his decision to withdraw the Italy midfielder, Newcastle\u2019s manager received a reminder that the widespread adoration he commands on Tyneside is no longer unconditional. It was last Saturday at St James\u2019 Park and, with 65 minutes gone, Newcastle were heading towards a 1-0 defeat against Brighton. If the outward show of dissent was muted, plenty of home supporters disagreed with the decision to replace the influential, if tiring, Tonali. Significantly, a manager who prides himself on an ability to read the room conceded his introduction of Joe Willock had failed to exert the desired effect. Two weeks, 8 November, marks the third anniversary of Howe\u2019s installation at Newcastle but with a largely long-serving squad turning stale and, worryingly, struggling to regain its previous harmony, his once near irrepressible tactical templates are starting to look chipped around the edges. Just over a year ago, Newcastle produced a breathtaking 4-1 Champions League home win over Paris Saint-Germain. Today, though, the fanbase are debating whether the impending three matches \u2013 Chelsea away on Sunday in the Premier League, Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup date with Chelsea at St James\u2019 and Arsenal\u2019s league visit on Saturday \u2013 should be regarded as sink or swim fixtures for Howe. While he remains an outstanding coach and no one is really suggesting he should be sacked any time soon, his hopes of leading Newcastle back to Europe and lifting a trophy are being undermined by capricious tailwinds partly outside his control. The high-intensity pressing game that blew PSG, and others, away arguably prompted the series of injuries responsible for last season\u2019s disappointing seventh-placed finish and the appointment of James Bunce as Newcastle\u2019s new performance director. In the hope of minimising soft tissue injuries, Bunce has modified Howe\u2019s demanding training regimen but such tweaks possibly explain the slow start to the campaign. It has left Newcastle mid-table and having scored eight goals in eight league games. The season is far from over, but with Newcastle desperate to secure their first major silverware since 1969, Wednesday\u2019s cup tie seems pivotal. Given that Newcastle\u2019s Saudi Arabian owners certainly do not lack cash, things would surely have been very different had the board not needed to expand the club\u2019s commercial income to comply with the Premier League profit and sustainability rules. Instead, the past two transfer windows have been quiet, leaving Howe short of the new right-winger, centre-half and central striker he craves. The need to meet PSR requirements allied to the departure of minority co-owners Amanda Staveley and Mehrdad Ghodoussi in July have created a sense that behind the scenes, Newcastle have become a bit corporate, slightly soulless even. Meanwhile, a summer involving key performers Alexander Isak, Bruno Guimar\u00e3es and Anthony Gordon becoming the subject of transfer speculation and the manager being linked with the England job disrupted once watertight unity. The contentious decision to replace Kieran Trippier as captain with the more emotional Guimar\u00e3es only exacerbated any fault lines. For some time the 34-year-old Trippier served as the lodestar of Newcastle\u2019s metamorphosis but the team miss the full-back\u2019s leadership qualities and his stellar crossing and dead ball deliveries. Tino Livramento is a sufficiently talented right-back to be part of the England squad but he is not as transformational an attacking outlet as Trippier at his best. \u201cIt was a difficult summer, for lots of different reasons, for a catalogue of things,\u201d says Howe. \u201cWhen you have multiple players affected by different things, it becomes harder. The general feel of the squad at the start of the season was different to previous years. \u201cMy job is to get the focus and harmony back where it should be, but it\u2019s taking longer than we initially hoped. We\u2019ve come through some really rocky spells in the past but underpinning the strength of the group was always a sense of duty, professionalism, love for the club and positive momentum. It meant we could ride through some difficult patches. \u201cNow we\u2019ve just got to make sure all those qualities are underpinning the squad again because our ability is unquestionable. But for every player to be at their best, there needs to be that unity, that ambition.\u201d Dressing rooms are fragile ecosystems and, as Newcastle enter a potentially season-defining seven days, Howe accepts a watershed moment beckons. \u201cI\u2019ve seen things, very quickly, go the wrong way in football,\u201d he says. \u201cSo everyone connected with Newcastle has a big job to try to keep that momentum positive and the dreams really big. That\u2019s absolutely crucial.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-25T13:57:33Z",
            "content": "It is a phrase that crops up 21 times in the Labour manifesto, 12 times in the Conservative manifesto, and has been used in the House of Commons more than 3,500 times in the last decade. So, surely everyone knows what \u201cworking people\u201d are \u2013 don\u2019t we? Perhaps not. In the buildup to next week\u2019s budget there has been ever-increasing scrutiny and a parallel lack of clarity about what Labour\u2019s manifesto commitment to not raise taxes on \u201cworking people\u201d actually means in practice. While ministers may want to insist that nothing can be given away in advance of a budget, they have faced inevitable questions about what they would view as a working person, often with mixed results. Speaking to broadcasters in Samoa, Keir Starmer said he would not use the term for people who had income from assets such as shares or property. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t come within my definition,\u201d he said. Downing Street hastily clarified that the prime minister did not mean people who owned small amounts of, for example, stocks or shares. There was, inevitably, a long round of questions at the subsequent No 10 media briefing about precisely who did fit the definition. Starmer\u2019s spokesperson set this out as \u201cthose who have to rely on their pay packets and do not always have the means to write a cheque, and it is those who are hardest hit by economic instability\u201d. What the PM had been referring to, she added, was \u201cthe broadest sense of who was in his mind\u2019s eye when it comes to the importance of economic stability\u201d \u2013 in other words, to an extent a working person is whoever Starmer sees them as being. Amid this slightly salad-like cascade of words sit two interlocking definitions, the first economic and relatively precise, the other political and notably more woolly. As more or less defined by the No 10 spokesperson, a working person is, for the most part, someone whose income is reliant on a regular wage, as distinct from someone who can rely on money from unearned wealth, for example rental income or share dividends. The two can, of course, cross over, hence the focus on where the bulk of someone\u2019s income derives. The National Residential Landlords Association rushed out a statement on Friday noting that 30% of landlords have full-time jobs and another 10% work part-time. Many people will still be uncertain where they sit. Speaking to the BBC on Friday morning, David Blunkett, the Labour peer and Blair-era cabinet minister, said he had been stopped by several recently retired people who asked where they fitted under the \u201cworking people\u201d categorisation. \u201cI don\u2019t have a particular answer for them, actually,\u201d Blunkett confessed. The political definition is even more vague, with \u201cworking people\u201d routinely used as an all-encompassing synonym for the sort of diligent, taxpaying, family-raising voters at whom almost all political parties mentally pitch their ideas. To use one example, the 12 references in the Conservative manifesto sets them out as citizens who will benefit variously from lower taxes, higher pay, continued consumer protections and more pragmatic net zero policies. These worlds, however, have noisily intersected in the Labour document, with its very specific promise on taxes. In practical terms, this will almost certainly mean some higher taxes on unearned income, for example capital gains tax. As set out repeatedly during the election, it will not involve increases to VAT, income tax or national insurance \u2013 or at least the NI paid by employees. That leaves a large patch of contested middle ground including things such as employers\u2019 NI contributions, whether or not tax thresholds are raised, and fuel duty. So by Wednesday afternoon, will you know whether the government sees you as a working person? Possibly not. Will the arguments continue? Definitely."

            "date": "2024-10-31T19:30:30Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s 9.30pm in Tel Aviv, Gaza and Beirut. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments: Senior US officials have held talks in Israel aimed at brokering a ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Two senior US envoys, Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk, met Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to talk about a ceasefire proposal for Lebanon. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said negotiators made \u201cgood progress\u201d toward a deal. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that we will see things transition in Lebanon in a not too distant future,\u201d US defense secretary Lloyd Austin said. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, who had expressed optimism of a speedy settlement \u201cin hours or days\u201d earlier on Thursday, said that Israel\u2019s \u201congoing escalation\u201d in his country \u201cdoes not inspire optimism\u201d. Netanyahu\u2019s office said the prime minister \u201cmade it clear that the main point is not this or that agreement on paper but Israel\u2019s ability and determination to enforce the agreement and thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon, in a manner that will return our residents securely to their homes\u201d. Thursday marked a day when more civilians in both Israel and Lebanon were killed since October 2023. The Lebanese health ministry said that Israeli attacks had killed 45 people in the previous 24 hours, amid bombing in the north-east Bekaa valley and infantry battles in the south. In one Bekaa village, eight people were killed from the same family. In northern Israel, seven people were killed by rocket fire from Lebanon, including four Thai agricultural workers. The Israeli army\u2019s evacuation call for several areas of south Lebanon on Thursday included a Palestinian refugee camp. Among the areas listed was Rashidieh camp, which houses thousands of Palestinian refugees. Israel issued its second evacuation order for the city of Baalbek and two surrounding villages in the Bekaa valley on Thursday afternoon, carrying out a series of airstrikes on the village of Durous a few hours later. The evacuation orders had prompted a mass exodus of residents from the city, which is home to a Unesco world heritage site. Israeli attacks killed at least one child in Lebanon each day and injured 10 others, the UN children\u2019s agency (Unicef) said. Citing the Lebanese health ministry, Unicef said 166 children have been killed since October 2023, while at least 1,168 have been injured. It awrned that the war in Lebanon is \u201cinflicting severe physical wounds and deep emotional scars\u201d on many of the country\u2019s children. Six Lebanese health workers were killed and four wounded in Israeli strikes across south Lebanon on Thursday, the health ministry said in a statement. Israel\u2019s military offensive in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 43,204 Palestinians and injured 101,641 since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said on Thursday. The toll includes 41 deaths in the previous 24 hours, according to the ministry. Palestinian authorities said three people had been killed in an Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank on Thursday. The Israeli army said it was targeting militants in the Nur Shams refugee camp in the West Bank city of Tulkarem, and had killed a Hamas militant who was involved in planning attacks. Israeli strikes killed five civilians on Syria\u2019s Qusayr region near the border with Lebanon, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based war monitor said the strikes targeted Qusayr, a town where Hezbollah operate. One strike targeted \u201ca weapons depot and a fuel storage facility for Hezbollah in the industrial city of Qusayr\u201d, killing five civilians, the Observatory said. A senior Hamas official said the group rejects any proposal for a temporary halt to more than a year of fighting in Gaza and insists on a lasting ceasefire. Mediators seeking to broker a Gaza ceasefire are expected to propose a truce of \u201cless than a month\u201d to Hamas, a source with knowledge of the talks told AFP on Wednesday. The UN should consider suspending Israel as a member state due to its continuing \u201cgenocide\u201d against the Palestinians, the divisive special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, has said. The comments on Thursday came a day after she published her latest report alleging that Israel was not just committing war crimes or crimes against humanity in Gaza, but a genocide. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned Israel could carry out the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of Gaza if the international community does not make a determined stand to prevent it. \u201cThe intention might be for the Palestinians to leave Gaza, for others to occupy it,\u201d Guterres told the Guardian. \u201cBut there has been \u2013 and I pay tribute to the courage and the resilience of the Palestinian people and to the determination of the Arab world \u2013 [an effort] to avoid the ethnic cleansing becoming a reality.\u201d A Palestinian student who was stripped of her UK student visa after remarks she made about the Israel-Gaza war has won a human rights appeal against the Home Office\u2019s decision. Israeli intelligence suggests that Iran is preparing to attack Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days, according to an Axios report. The attack may take place before the US presidential election on 5 November, the outlet said, citing two Israeli sources. The attack is expected to be carried out from Iraq using a large number of drones and ballistic missiles, the sources said. As we reported earlier, two senior US officials, Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk, met with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier on Thursday. The meetings were described as \u201csubstantive and constructive and focused on a number of issues in depth, including Iran, Lebanon, Gaza, and securing the release of hostages,\u201d a US official told the Times of Israel. The official said: There was a particular focus on efforts to secure a ceasefire deal in Lebanon that allows people on both sides of the Blue Line to return safely to their homes as well as new initiatives to secure the release of hostages, which Hamas must do without delay. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said negotiators have made \u201cgood progress\u201d toward a deal that would bring a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Washington was \u201cworking very hard\u201d on concluding arrangements on a deal that would include Hezbollah\u2019s withdrawal from the border region with Israel, Blinken said on Thursday, AFP reported. Blinken said: Based on my recent trip to the region, and the work that\u2019s ongoing right now, we have made good progress on those understandings. \u201cWe still have more work to do,\u201d he said, calling for a \u201cdiplomatic resolution, including through a ceasefire.\u201d Blinken also called for the \u201ceffective implementation\u201d of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which would calls for the disarmament of non-state groups in Lebanon and a full Israeli withdrawal from the country. The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, speaking alongside Blinken, said there was an \u201copportunity\u201d in Lebanon. Austin said: We\u2019re hopeful that we will see things transition in Lebanon in a not too distant future. The UN should consider suspending Israel as a member state due to its continuing \u201cgenocide\u201d against the Palestinians, the divisive special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories has said. Francesca Albanese was speaking to a UN committee on the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people in New York the day after she published her latest report alleging that Israel was not just committing war crimes or crimes against humanity in Gaza, but a genocide. \u201cIt is time to consider suspending the credentials of Israel as a member state of the UN,\u201d she said. I understand the sensitivity because none of you have clean hands when it comes to human rights. She added that no other country had defied so many UN resolutions for so long. In her report, Albanese claimed: Israel has pursued a pattern of conduct \u2018deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction\u2019. She is a divisive UN rapporteur, and was prevented from holding a briefing at the US Congress this week. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, described her in a tweet as unfit for office, adding: The United Nations should not tolerate antisemitism from a UN-affiliated official hired to promote human rights. Read the full story here: UN should consider suspending Israel over \u2018genocide\u2019 against Palestinians, says special rapporteur Israeli attacks killed 45 people in Lebanon in the past 24 hours, according to the latest update from the Lebanese health ministry on Thursday. It brings the total death toll in Lebanon from Israeli attacks to 2,865 since October 2023, it said. Separately, the UN children\u2019s agency (Unicef) warned that the war in Lebanon is \u201cinflicting severe physical wounds and deep emotional scars\u201d on many of the country\u2019s children. Citing the Lebanese health ministry, Unicef said 166 children have been killed since October 2023, while at least 1,168 have been injured. It said: Since October 4th of this year, at least one child has been killed and 10 injured daily. Thousands more children who have survived the many months of constant bombings physically unscathed, are now acutely distressed by the violence and chaos around them. The agency said its teams have met children \u201cgripped by overwhelming fear and increased anxiety\u201d who are \u201chaunted by nightmares, headaches, and loss of appetite\u201d. \u201cWar tears apart the safe and nurturing environments children need,\u201d it said, adding that children who are \u201cforced to endure prolonged periods of traumatic stress\u201d will face \u201csevere health and psychological risks\u201d that can last a lifetime. The European Union condemned \u201cany attempt to abrogate the 1967 agreement between Israel and UNRWA or to otherwise attempt to obstruct its capacity to operate its mandate\u201d. The comments followed Israel\u2019s decision to adopt two controversial bills banning the UN agency for Palestinian refugees from operating inside occupied Israeli territory. \u201cIf implemented, the laws will have far-reaching consequences, stopping all UNRWA\u2019s operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, de facto preventing UNRWA\u2019s vital operations in Gaza hampering UNRWA\u2019s provision of health, education and social services in the West Bank and revoking UNRWA\u2019s diplomatic privileges and immunities in Israel,\u201d said a EU statement. \u201cAs long as there is no sustainable solution to the conflict, the mandate of UNRWA will remain vital.\u201d The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said five civilians were killed Thursday in Israeli strikes on Syria\u2019s Qusayr region near the border with Lebanon, where Israel said it hit Hezbollah weapons depots. The Britain-based war monitor said the strikes targeted Qusayr, a town where Hezbollah operate. One strike targeted \u201ca weapons depot and a fuel storage facility for Hezbollah in the industrial city of Qusayr\u201d, killing five civilians, the Observatory said. The other strikes targeted warehouses and bridges according to the war monitor. The Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesman Avichay Adraee said \u201cweapons depots and headquarters used by\u201d Hezbollah were hit in the Qusayr region. Adraee said the strikes sought to thwart attempts to \u201ctransfer weapons from Iran via Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon\u201d. A chief medical official at Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza has described catastrophic conditions at the facility. \u201cThe hospital has no medical teams \u2013 doctors, surgeons, orthopaedics. More than 33 people, between doctors and nurses, have also been arrested,\u201d Eid Sabbah, the director of nursing at the hospital, told Al Jazeera. The IDF has destroyed oxygen and electricity stations, the hospital\u2019s main water pump and ambulances, Sabbah said. \u201cThe things that we have are things that can\u2019t keep people alive,\u201d he said. Over a hundred wounded patients are still in dire need inside the facility, but only three doctors remain on site, including junior doctors who aren\u2019t qualified to operate. Five days ago, a delegation from the World Health Organization brought a small amount of fuel for the generators to operate and some medical supplies, but \u201cimmediately after the delegation left the hospital on the same night, the Israeli army stormed the hospital, destroyed a lot of things inside, destroyed the medical supplies that we had received,\u201d he said. The Times of Israeli is reporting that the Israeli man killed alongside four foreign nationals by a Hezbollah rocket near Metula today was a 47-year-old called Omer Weinstein and he was a father of four. \u201cThe agreements, the papers, the proposals, the numbers [UN Security Council Resolution] 1509, 1701 \u2014 all these have their place, but they are not the main thing,\u201d he says, hours after meeting and making a similar point to top White House Middle East aides. \u201cThe main thing is our ability and our determination to enforce security, to thwart attacks against us and to act against the arming of our enemies as much as is necessary despite all the pressures and constraints \u2014 that is the main thing.\u201d Turning to address Iran, the prime minister says: \u201cThe brash words of the leaders of the regime in Iran cannot cover up the fact that Israel has greater freedom of action in Iran today than ever before. We can reach anywhere in Iran as needed.\u201d Netanyahu adds that the fight against the Iranian axis is guided by the \u201ctotal victory concept,\u201d but he stopped short of predicting when the war would end. In regards to the remaining hostages kept in Gaza by Hamas, the prime minister says that over half have returned home and they are working on securing safety for the rest, but says these negotiations will be kept behind the scenes. Acute food insecurity is expected to worsen in war-stricken Sudan and nearly two dozen other countries and territories in the next six months, largely as a result of conflict and violence, an analysis by the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization and World Food Programme has found. The latest edition of the twice-yearly Hunger Hotspots report, published on Thursday, provides early warnings on food crises and situations around the world where food insecurity is likely to worsen, with a focus on the most severe and deteriorating situations of acute hunger. An 18-month conflict has driven hunger in Sudan by disrupting food systems, causing displacement, and blocking access for humanitarian support. Weather extremes, such as floods, have also played a role in worsening food insecurity\u2026 Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told visiting US envoy Amos Hochstein and US Middle East adviser Brett McGurk that any ceasefire deal with Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah would have to guarantee Israeli security. \u201cThe prime minister specified that the main issue is not paperwork for this or that deal, but Israel\u2019s determination and capacity to ensure the deal\u2019s application and to prevent any threat to its security from Lebanon,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office said after the meeting in Jerusalem. Lebanese official media reported Israeli strikes near Baalbek on Thursday, after Israel issued evacuation warnings for the main eastern city for the second day in a row. \u201cEnemy aircraft launched four strikes on the village of Douris and the surroundings of the city of Baalbek,\u201d the National News Agency said. On 1 July 2024, the European hospital in Gaza evacuated all patients and staff. On that day I should have been shoulder to shoulder with my colleagues. I should have been tending gravely injured patients. I should have been helping them to flee. On ventilators, hooked up to IV fluids, on gurneys, in and out of consciousness and clinging to life, they had done nothing to deserve their situation, and they deserved my help. Instead, I watched from my home in Texas and read messages from the other medics, as an overcrowded hospital transformed into a ghost town. With anguish, I witnessed the tragedy unfold from afar. A week earlier, I had been in Jordan with the rest of my team, preparing to cross into Gaza for our humanitarian mission. However, less than 48 hours before we attempted the Rafah border crossing, the Israeli military refused my entry \u201cdue to Palestinian roots\u201d\u2026 It has just gone 5pm in Gaza City, Tel Aviv and Beirut. Here is a summary of the latest developments: Senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told Agence France-Press (AFP) that the group rejected the idea of a short-term pause in the fighting mooted by US and Qatari mediators. Mediators had hoped that a short pause would create a window to bring in humanitarian aid to Gaza\u2019s desperate civilian population and to negotiate a permanent ceasefire. \u201cThe idea of a temporary pause in the war, only to resume aggression later, is something we have already expressed our position on. Hamas supports a permanent end to the war, not a temporary one,\u201d he said. Senior US officials were to meet their Israeli counterparts on Thursday to discuss a possible deal to end the conflict in Lebanon and secure Israel\u2019s northern border from Hezbollah attacks. On Wednesday, Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati expressed optimism about a ceasefire in \u201cthe coming hours or days\u201d and Hezbollah\u2019s new leader Naim Qassem said the group would accept a truce under certain conditions. A rocket barrage fired by Hezbollah at Israel\u2019s north has killed five people, including an Israeli farmer and four Thai labourers. The incident occurred near the frontline near the border community of Metula, whose citizens largely evacuated close to a year ago and which sits in a closed military zone. Six Lebanese health workers were killed and four injured in Israeli strikes across south Lebanon on Thursday, the health ministry said in a statement. The Israeli army\u2019s evacuation call for several areas of south Lebanon on Thursday, included a Palestinian refugee camp. It warned it was poised to hit Hezbollah targets in those areas. Among the areas listed was Rashidieh camp, which houses thousands of Palestinian refugees. A Lebanese security source said one person was killed on Thursday by an Israeli strike on a road where a Hezbollah van carrying munitions was hit the previous day. The drone strike hit the Araya-Kahhale road which links the capital Beirut to Lebanon\u2019s eastern Bekaa valley, the source told AFP, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. It targeted a Mercedes vehicle, killing the driver, the source said, without identifying the victim. Also on Thursday, an Israeli drone strike hit a motorbike near the coastal town of Naqura, the official National News Agency (NNA) reported. Another motorbike was hit in the eastern Bekaa valley, it added. The United Nations children\u2019s agency said the Israel-Hezbollah war has seen one child die a day in Lebanon over the past month. \u201cSince October 4 of this year, at least one child has been killed and 10 injured daily,\u201d Unicef said, adding that \u201cthe ongoing war in Lebanon is upending children\u2019s lives\u201d. Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the war effort depends on the economy ahead of Israel\u2019s 2025 state budget. He said: \u201cWe cannot have a strong army if we have no way to finance it. Therefore, security depends on the economy, but the economy also depends on security. If there is an ability to damage our cities, our industry, then obviously our economic capacity would be affected.\u201d The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has warned Israel could carry out the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of Gaza if the international community does not make a determined stand to prevent it. Guterres made his appeal at a time of mounting civilian casualties from the Israeli bombardment of northern Gaza. A strike on Tuesday in Beit Lahiya district killed at least 93 people, in what the UN said was just one of at least seven \u201cmass casualty incidents\u201d across Gaza in the past week. A surge in hostilities in the Gaza Strip has raised concerns that the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d of famine will materialise, UN food agencies warned on Thursday. A report by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme estimated that 41% of the population, or 876,000 people, will face \u201cemergency\u201d levels of hunger from November until the end of April. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three people were killed on Thursday in Israeli strikes on Syria\u2019s Qusayr region near the border with Lebanon, where Israel said it hit Hezbollah weapons depots. One strike targeted \u201ca weapons depot and a fuel storage facility for Hezbollah in the industrial city of Qusayr\u201d, killing three and injuring five others, the Syrian Observatory said. The other strikes targeted warehouses near the Lebanese border and a bridge south of Qusayr, it added. Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee said \u201cweapons depots and headquarters used by\u201d Hezbollah were hit in the Qusayr region. Adraee said the strikes sought to thwart attempts to \u201ctransfer weapons from Iran via Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon\u201d. Only two doctors are still serving at the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza after raids by Israeli forces and the detention of medical staff, aid groups say. Mahmoud Shalabi, deputy director of programmes for the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, said there were only two doctors and 70 nurses working in a hospital that would usually have 500 medical staff. Medical charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said it had confirmed its employee, orthopaedic surgeon, Mohammed Obeid, was detained during a military operation on 26 October. US state department officials have identified nearly 500 potential incidents of civilian harm during Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza involving US-furnished weapons, but have not taken further action on any of them, according to three sources, including a US official familiar with the matter. Israeli police said on Thursday they had arrested an Israeli couple on suspicion of spying for Iran, barely a week after two groups allegedly working for Tehran were detained. \u201cThe thwarting of Iran\u2019s efforts to recruit Israelis continues,\u201d said a statement from the police and Israel\u2019s internal security agency, Shin Bet. The Irish peace-keeping force\u2019s base in Lebanon has been hit by a rocket, suspected to have been fired by Hezbollah. Nobody was injured, the chief of staff of the Irish Defence Force said on Thursday after a briefing with the foreign minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin. Lt Gen Sean Clancy said it had struck an unoccupied part of Camp Shamrock, 7km from the Israeli border. Three Palestinians were killed in Israeli military operations in the occupied West Bank city of Tulkarem overnight, the health ministry and an official said on Thursday. The Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry reported \u201ctwo martyrs in Nur Shams camp in Tulkarem due to the occupation\u2019s shelling\u201d. The ministry on Wednesday evening reported another death in the area, saying \u201ca martyr shot by the occupation arrived at Thabet Thabet Tulkarem government hospital\u201d. The Israeli military said its soldiers had \u201cbeen operating as part of a counter-terrorism operation in the area of Nur Shams\u201d along with police and the Shin Bet security agency. On Thursday, army said in a statement that it had \u201celiminated the terrorist Hussam Mallah\u201d, whom it identified as an important member of Hamas in the area. At least 43,204 Palestinians have been killed by Israel\u2019s military offensive in the Gaza Strip, and 101,641 injured, since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said on Thursday. The toll includes 41 deaths in the previous 24 hours. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, under pressure from US treasury secretary Janet Yellen, will sign a waiver to extend cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian banks for another month after the cabinet agreed, his spokesperson said on Thursday. Israel\u2019s military said on Thursday it shot down a drone smuggling weapons from Egyptian territory to Israel on Wednesday. Israeli officials have said during the war in Gaza that Hamas used tunnels running under the border into Egypt\u2019s Sinai region to smuggle arms. However, Egypt says it destroyed tunnel networks leading to Gaza years ago and created a buffer zone and border fortifications that prevent smuggling. A Palestinian student who was stripped of her student visa after remarks she made about the Israel-Gaza war has won a human rights appeal against the UK Home Office\u2019s decision. Dana Abu Qamar, 20, came to the attention of authorities after statements made at a university demonstration on Gaza\u2019s historical resistance to Israel\u2019s \u201coppressive regime\u201d and a subsequent interview with Sky News. Israeli emergency services said a rocket launched from Lebanon killed two people in an olive grove in northern Israel on Thursday, bringing the day\u2019s toll to seven dead, reports Agence France-Presse. Medics \u201ctreated and attempted resuscitation on a 30-year-old male and a 60-year-old female, who were then pronounced dead. A 71-year-old male with mild shrapnel injuries to his limbs was evacuated,\u201d the Magen David Adom first responders said in a statement. Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, under pressure from US treasury secretary Janet Yellen, will sign a waiver to extend cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian banks for another month after the cabinet agreed, his spokesperson said on Thursday, reports Reuters. Smotrich in June extended a waiver that allows cooperation between Israel\u2019s banking system and Palestinian banks in the West Bank, but only for four months until the end of October. The waiver allows Israeli banks to process shekel payments for services and salaries tied to the Palestinian Authority without the risk of being charged with money laundering and funding terrorism. Without it, Palestinian banks would be cut off from the Israeli financial system. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three people were killed on Thursday in Israeli strikes on Syria\u2019s Qusayr region near the border with Lebanon, where Israel said it hit Hezbollah weapons depots. The UK-based war monitor said three strikes targeted the town of Qusayr and surrounding areas. One strike targeted \u201ca weapons depot and a fuel storage facility for Hezbollah in the industrial city of Qusayr\u201d, killing three and injuring five others, the Syrian Observatory said. The other strikes targeted warehouses near the Lebanese border and a bridge south of Qusayr, according to the war monitor. Agence France-Presse reports that the Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee said \u201cweapons depots and headquarters used by\u201d Hezbollah were hit in the Qusayr region. Adraee said the strikes sought to thwart attempts to \u201ctransfer weapons from Iran via Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon\u201d. The state news agency, Sana, reported Israeli strikes on Qusayr\u2019s industrial zone and some residential neighbourhoods, saying they caused material damage. The Irish peace-keeping force\u2019s base in Lebanon has been hit by a rocket, suspected to have been fired by Hezbollah. Nobody was injured, the chief of staff of the Irish Defence Force said on Thursday after a briefing with the foreign minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin. Lt Gen Sean Clancy said it had struck an unoccupied part of Camp Shamrock, 7km from the Israeli border. The assessment was that the rocket, which was Russian made, \u201cwas travelling from north to south into Israel\u201d. There have been about 30 attacks on UN peacekeeping force bases in the blue buffer zone between Lebanon and Israel of which 20 have been attributed to the Israel Defense Forces, Unifil spokesperson Andrea Tenenti said yesterday. Israel\u2019s military offensive in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 43,204 Palestinians and injured 101,641 since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said on Thursday. The toll includes 41 deaths in the previous 24 hours, according to the ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Only two doctors are still serving at the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza after raids by Israeli forces and the detention of medical staff, aid groups say. Medical charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said it has confirmed its employee, orthopaedic surgeon, Mohammed Obeid, was detained during a military operation on 26 October. MSF said: Dr Obeid has been working tirelessly since the beginning of the war, offering his support as a doctor to multiple hospitals in Gaza. His work has saved countless lives. We call for the safety and the protection of our colleague, and for all medical staff in Gaza who work under impossible conditions and are facing horrific violence as they try to provide care.\u201d The hospital is struggling to deal with an influx of casualties after recent Israeli operations in the Beit Lahia area of Gaza, including a strike on a block of flats that killed 93 people on Tuesday. Mahmoud Shalabi, deputy director of programmes for the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, said there were only two doctors and 70 nurses working in a hospital that would usually have 500 medical staff. \u201cThat place is the only place right now that is still barely functioning with very minimum resources,\u201d said Shalabi. He added: Every now and then the United Nations go and manage to evacuate around 20 patients every, like, three days, and they bring them to Gaza City \u2026 [but] there is no space to host those patients coming from the north or from any new massacre that is happening in Gaza City.\u201d The Palestinian ministry of health said Kamal Adwan hospital had been subject to \u201crepeated attacks\u201d by Israel, including a strike on Thursday that hit the hospital\u2019s third floor, which they said damaged medical stocks. Three Palestinians were killed in Israeli military operations in the occupied West Bank city of Tulkarem overnight, the health ministry and an official said on Thursday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry reported \u201ctwo martyrs in Nur Shams camp in Tulkarem due to the occupation\u2019s shelling\u201d. Rami Alyan of the camp\u2019s popular service committee told AFP the Israeli army raided Nur Shams camp in the northern West Bank city at 2am, local time. \u201cThe occupation forces are still conducting bulldozing operations in the streets of the camp, and there are injuries,\u201d he said. The two killed were a 16-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man, he added. According to AFP, the Israeli military said its soldiers had \u201cbeen operating as part of a counter-terrorism operation in the area of Nur Shams\u201d along with police and the Shin Bet security agency. The air force \u201cstruck an armed terrorist cell that fired at the forces\u201d during the operation, the statement added. The Palestinian health ministry on Wednesday evening reported another death in the area, saying \u201ca martyr shot by the occupation arrived at Thabet Thabet Tulkarem government hospital\u201d. The official Palestinian news agency Wafa said a 30-year-old man, Hossam Mallah, was killed in Tulkarem camp, the city\u2019s other refugee camp, by \u201ca special force that infiltrated the camp with a taxi and van\u201d. The army said in its Thursday statement that it had \u201celiminated the terrorist Hussam Mallah\u201d, whom it identified as an important member of Hamas in the area \u201cwho was involved in the planning of terrorist attacks within an immediate time frame\u201d. From a few points on the periphery between Israel and Gaza, it is possible to see the bombed-out ruins of the besieged Palestinian territory; every so often, the boom and thud of airstrikes and artillery fire send plumes of grey and white smoke into the wide autumn sky. For most onlookers, the scene is apocalyptic - but for rightwing Israelis who want to resettle the strip, it\u2019s a promising new horizon. Once dismissed as the pipe dream of fringe extremists, the idea is gaining momentum thanks to Israel\u2019s military success in Gaza, and political support from Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition. Last week, near Be\u2019eri, a border kibbutz devastated by the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023, the pro-settlement organisation Nachala held a \u201cPreparing to Resettle Gaza\u201d conference, laying out its vision for the strip\u2019s future. The event was given a green light by the Israeli military despite the fact the area is still technically a closed military zone. Several hundred people showed up, including government ministers and Knesset members\u2026 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war effort depends on the economy ahead of Israel\u2019s 2025 state budget. \u201cWe cannot have a strong army if we have no way to finance it. Therefore, security depends on the economy, but the economy also depends on security. If there is an ability to damage our cities, our industry, then obviously our economic capacity would be affected.\u201d Netanyahu claims the Israeli economy has been \u201csurprisingly resilient\u201d during the last year of war. The prime minister did caution that there would be cuts elsewhere. \u201cIf you give to one place, you unfortunately have to take from another place,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are ways to do this.\u201d Our correspondent Peter Beaumont has more detail on the attack which killed five people in northern Israel (see post at 11.31GMT). A rocket barrage fired by Hezbollah at Israel\u2019s north has killed five people, including an Israeli farmer and four Thai labourers. The incident occurred near the front line near the border community of Metula, whose citizens largely evacuated close to a year ago and which sits in a closed military zone. Despite large scale evacuations of northern Israel some agricultural activity has continued in rural areas despite the rocket fire. The deaths come as Hezbollah has shifted back to concentrating most (although not all) of its fire in a 7-10 kilometre area closest to the border. Six Lebanese health workers were killed and four wounded in Israeli strikes across south Lebanon on Thursday, the health ministry said in a statement. Meanwhile, The United Nations children\u2019s agency says the Israel-Hezbollah war has seen one child die a day in Lebanon over the past month. \u201cSince October 4 of this year, at least one child has been killed and 10 injured daily,\u201d UNICEF said, adding that \u201cthe ongoing war in Lebanon is upending children\u2019s lives.\u201d Diplomatic efforts are also under way to agree a short halt to fighting in Gaza. But on Thursday, senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told Agence France-Press (AFP) that the group rejected the idea of a short-term pause in the fighting mooted by US and Qatari mediators. Mediators had hoped that a short pause would create a window to bring in humanitarian aid to Gaza\u2019s desperate civilian population and to negotiate a permanent ceasefire, but Hamas rejected this, reports AFP. \u201cThe idea of a temporary pause in the war, only to resume aggression later, is something we have already expressed our position on. Hamas supports a permanent end to the war, not a temporary one,\u201d Nunu said. Any deal to stabilise Israel\u2019s front with Lebanon is likely to come first, ahead of any ceasefire for Gaza, reports AFP. Last week, Israel\u2019s chief of general staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said: In the north, there\u2019s a possibility of reaching a sharp conclusion.\u201d In his first speech since taking over, Qassem said Hezbollah could continue to resist Israeli air and ground attacks in Lebanon for months, but he also opened the door to a negotiated truce if presented with an Israeli offer. \u201cIf the Israelis decide that they want to stop the aggression, we say we accept, but under the conditions that we see as appropriate and suitable,\u201d he said. Senior US officials were to meet their Israeli counterparts on Thursday to discuss a possible deal to end the conflict in Lebanon and secure Israel\u2019s northern border from Hezbollah attacks. The US visit came as Hamas rejected separate truce plans proposed for the fighting in Gaza (see 10.32am GMT), where Israeli strikes continued overnight, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Less than a week before the US presidential election, Washington\u2019s envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk were expected in Israel. Israeli forces continued their fierce ground and air campaign against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. On Wednesday, Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati expressed optimism about a ceasefire in \u201cthe coming hours or days\u201d and Hezbollah\u2019s new leader Naim Qassem said the group would accept a truce under certain conditions. According to Israeli media reports citing government sources, the plan brokered by the US team would see Hezbollah forces retreat about 20 miles (30 kilometres) from the border, north of the Litani river, reports AFP. Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and the Lebanese army would then take charge of the border, alongside UN peacekeepers. Lebanon would be responsible for preventing Hezbollah from rearming itself with imported weapons, and Israel would retain its rights under international law to act in self-defence. Five people were killed, including four foreign workers and one Israeli farmer, in a Hezbollah attack on Israel\u2019s northern town of Metula on Thursday, reports Reuters, citing Israel\u2019s Channel 12. UN food agencies warned on Thursday of deadly hunger levels in 16 \u201chunger hotspots\u201d in coming months, with the Palestinian territories, Sudan and South Sudan, Mali and Haiti of most concern, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Conflict is driving most of the acute food insecurity in all those areas analysed by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme. Extreme weather was a major factor in other regions, while economic inequality and high debt in many developing countries are hurting governments\u2019 capacity to react, according to the joint report covering forecasts for November 2024 to May 2025. Humanitarian action was urgently needed to prevent starvation and death in the Palestinian territories, Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti and Mali, said the report, based on research by experts from the two Rome-based United Nations agencies, reports AFP. \u201cWithout immediate humanitarian efforts and concerted international action to address severe access constraints and advocate for the de-escalation of conflict and insecurity, further starvation and loss of life are likely\u201d in those spots, it found. Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, along with Nigeria, Chad, Mozambique and Myanmar, are of \u201cvery high concern\u201d, it said. In all those countries, conflict was either a major driver of hunger, or a contributor. A surge in hostilities in the Gaza Strip has raised concerns that the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d of famine will materialise, said the report. According to AFP, it estimated that 41% of the population, or 876,000 people, will face \u201cemergency\u201d levels of hunger from November until the end of April. Nearly 16%, or 345,000 people, will experience the most serious \u201ccatastrophic\u201d levels. As of mid-October, 1.9 million people in Gaza have been displaced, it said. Conflict forces people to flee their homes, \u201cdisrupting livelihoods and income, limiting market access, and resulting in price fluctuations and erratic food production and consumption,\u201d the report said. With its focus on the most severe and worsening countries, the UN agencies said the report did not \u201crepresent all countries/territories experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity\u201d. The agencies said 2024 marked the second consecutive year of declining funding for humanitarian assistance, while 12 appeals faced funding shortfalls of more than 75%, including for Ethiopia, Yemen, Syria and Myanmar. A Palestinian student who was stripped of her student visa after remarks she made about the Israel-Gaza war has won a human rights appeal against the UK Home Office\u2019s decision. The Home Office failed to demonstrate that the presence of Dana Abu Qamar, 20, was \u201cnot conducive to public good\u201d after the law student\u2019s visa was revoked in December 2023, according to a tribunal ruling. She came to the attention of authorities after statements made at a university demonstration on Gaza\u2019s historical resistance to Israel\u2019s \u201coppressive regime\u201d and a subsequent interview with Sky News. The dual Jordanian-Canadian citizen of Palestinian origin said: For 16 years Gaza has been under blockade, and for the first time they are actively resisting, they are not on the defence, and this is truly a once in a lifetime experience.\u201d She also said: And everyone is, we are both in fear, but also in fear of what, how Israel will retaliate and how we\u2019ve seen it retaliate overnight, and the missiles that it\u2019s launched and the attacks, but also we are full of pride. We are really, really full of joy of what happened.\u201d Abu Qamar, who led the Friends of Palestine society at the University of Manchester, said she was misinterpreted and that she was seeking to support Palestinian resistance to occupation and does not condone the use of violence against civilians, nor has she expressed support for Hamas. The tribunal said the Home Office decision was a \u201cdisproportionate interference with her protected right to free speech\u201d under the European convention on human rights. It found that her statements could not be taken as support for Hamas or the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October. Syrian state media said Israeli strikes hit the town of Qusayr near the Lebanese border on Thursday, the latest in a series of raids in the area, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cAn Israeli aggression targeted the Qusayr area in the southern Homs countryside,\u201d causing \u201cmaterial damage to the industrial city and some residential neighbourhoods,\u201d the state news agency, Sana, said. A senior Hamas official said on Thursday that the group rejects any proposal for a temporary halt to more than a year of fighting in Gaza and insists on a lasting ceasefire, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cThe idea of a temporary pause in the war, only to resume aggression later, is something we have already expressed our position on. Hamas supports a permanent end to the war, not a temporary one,\u201d Taher al-Nunu, a senior leader of the group, told AFP. Mediators seeking to broker a Gaza ceasefire are expected to propose a truce of \u201cless than a month\u201d to Hamas, a source with knowledge of the talks told AFP on Wednesday. Meetings between the Mossad head David Barnea, CIA director Bill Burns and Qatar\u2019s prime minister in Doha, which concluded on Monday, discussed proposing a \u201cshort-term\u201d truce of \u201cless than a month\u201d, the source told AFP on condition of anonymity because of the talks\u2019 sensitivity. The proposal involves exchanging Israeli hostages for Palestinians in Israeli prisons and increasing aid to Gaza, the source added. \u201cUS officials believe that if a short-term deal can be reached, it could lead to a more permanent agreement,\u201d the source told AFP. Nunu said the group had not received any proposal so far, adding if it gets such a plan, it would respond. However, he reiterated the demands the group has been insisting on for months: \u201ca permanent ceasefire, withdrawal (of Israeli forces) from Gaza, the return of displaced people, sufficient humanitarian aid to Gaza and a serious prisoner exchange deal\u201d. Israel\u2019s military said on Thursday it shot down a drone smuggling weapons from Egyptian territory to Israel on Wednesday, reports Reuters. Israeli officials have said during the war in Gaza that Palestinian armed group Hamas used tunnels running under the border into Egypt\u2019s Sinai region to smuggle arms. However, Egypt says it destroyed tunnel networks leading to Gaza years ago and created a buffer zone and border fortifications that prevent smuggling. Earlier in October, the Israeli military also said it foiled a weapon smuggling attempt from Egypt after downing a drone carrying guns and bullets, reports Reuters. Israel\u2019s military issued an evacuation order for residents in Lebanon\u2019s Baalbek city and surrounding areas on Thursday, for the second day in a row, reports Reuters. A Lebanese security source said one person was killed on Thursday by an Israeli strike on a road where a Hezbollah van carrying munitions was hit the previous day, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The drone strike hit the Araya-Kahhale road which links the capital Beirut to Lebanon\u2019s eastern Bekaa valley, the source told AFP, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. It targeted a Mercedes vehicle, killing the driver, the source said, without identifying the victim. The official National News Agency (NNA) said a \u201chostile drone\u201d targeted the car on the key road that passes through the town of Araya. On Wednesday, an Israeli strike hit a Hezbollah van carrying munitions on the same highway, according to the security source, who said the attack killed the driver. The same day, municipal authorities in Araya and Kahhale called on the Lebanese army to \u201cintervene immediately\u201d to stop the road being used to transport weapons or fighters, reports AFP. Also on Thursday, an Israeli drone strike hit a motorbike near the coastal town of Naqura, NNA said. Another motorbike was hit in the eastern Bekaa valley, it added. Reuters reports that the Israeli military said on Thursday it had shot down a drone smuggling weapons from Egyptian territory to Israel on Wednesday. No other information was provided. We will update the blog as more details come in. Israeli police said on Thursday they had arrested an Israeli couple on suspicion of spying for Iran, barely a week after two groups allegedly working for Tehran were detained, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cThe thwarting of Iran\u2019s efforts to recruit Israelis continues,\u201d said a statement from the police and Israel\u2019s internal security agency, Shin Bet. The two Israelis, a couple from the central city of Lod, had been involved in gathering intelligence on \u201cnational infrastructures, security sites and tracking a female academic,\u201d the statement alleged: Rafael and Lala Goliev \u2026 residents of Lod, were arrested after they carried out tasks on behalf of an Iranian cell that recruits Israelis from the Caucasus countries in Israel.\u201d According to AFP, Israeli police charged that the couple were recruited by Elshan (Elhan) Agayev, an Azerbaijani national acting on behalf of Iranian officials. It was unclear if Agayev is based in Israel. They alleged that the Golievs carried out surveillance of sensitive Israeli sites, including the headquarters of Israel\u2019s the Mossad spy agency, and collected intelligence on an academic working at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. As AFP reports, Thursday\u2019s announcement comes little more than a week after Israeli security services said they had uncovered two other suspected spy rings. The Israeli army\u2019s evacuation call for several areas of south Lebanon on Thursday, includes a Palestinian refugee camp, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). It warned it was poised to hit Hezbollah targets in those areas. \u201cHezbollah\u2019s terrorist activities force the IDF (army) to act forcefully against it in these areas, and we do not intend to harm you,\u201d the Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X. Among the areas listed was Rashidieh camp, which houses thousands of Palestinian refugees. Al-Haush, Borgholiyeh and Ansar are among the areas in southern Lebanon ordered to evacuate, reports Al Jazeera. It cites the Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee, as ordering residents of 10 towns and villages, mostly near Tyre and Nabatieh, to evacuate. He said the army would soon \u201cforcefully act\u201d against these areas. \u201cYou are prohibited from heading south. Any movement south could be dangerous to your life,\u201d he wrote in a post on X. The Israeli army has issued evacuation calls for several southern Lebanese villages, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). More details soon \u2026 A Lebanese family planning for a daughter\u2019s wedding were killed in an Israeli strike on their home, reports the Associated Press (AP). According to a report by the AP, the Gharibs\u2019 apartment in the al-Housh district of the Tyre neighbourhood was directly hit by an Israeli airstrike on 23 September. Reda Gharib, who lives in Senegal told the AP that his family in Tyre received a call from the Israeli military to evacuate or risk their lives. His aunts decided to leave for Beirut but his father, mother and three sisters remained. Gharib\u2019s father, Ahmed, a retired Lebanese army officer, his mother, Hanan, and his three sisters were all killed in the strike. \u201cThe whole apartment was gone. It is back to bare bones. As if there was nothing there,\u201d said Gharib, speaking to the AP from the Senegalese capital, Dakar, where he has been living since 2020. The Israeli military said it struck a Hezbollah site hiding rocket launchers and missiles. Gharib told the AP his family had no connection to Hezbollah. The direct hit gutted their apartment, while those above and below suffered only damage, suggesting a specific part of the building was targeted. Gharib said it was his family\u2019s home. The strike was one of more than 1,600 Israel said it carried out on 23 September, the first day of an intensified bombardment of Lebanon it has waged for the past month. More than 500 people were killed that day, a casualty figure not observed in Gaza on a single day until the second week, said Emily Tripp, director of London-based Airwars, a conflict monitoring group. Gharib told the AP that his sister Maya was engaged and planned to marry on 12 October but as tensions with Israel grew in September, Gharib\u2019s plans to come home for the wedding were uncertain. She told him she would put it off until he could get there. After the strike, her fiance, also an army officer, found her body and those of the rest of her family in a hospital morgue in Tyre. \u201cShe was not destined to have her wedding. We paraded her as a bride to paradise instead,\u201d Gharib said. US state department officials have identified nearly 500 potential incidents of civilian harm during Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza involving US-furnished weapons, but have not taken further action on any of them, according to three sources, including a US official familiar with the matter. The incidents \u2013 some of which may have violated international humanitarian law, according to the sources \u2013 have been recorded since 7 October 2023, when the Gaza war started. They are being collected by the state department\u2019s Civilian Harm Incident Response Guidance (CHIRG), a formal mechanism for tracking and assessing any reported misuse of US-origin weapons. State department officials gathered the incidents from public and non-public sources, including media reporting, civil society groups and foreign government contacts. The mechanism, which was established in August 2023 to be applied to all countries that receive US arms, has three stages: incident analysis, policy impact assessment and coordinated department action. None of the Gaza cases had yet reached the third stage of action, said a former US official familiar with the matter. Options, the former official said, could range from working with Israel\u2019s government to help mitigate harm, to suspending existing arms export licenses or withholding future approvals. The Washington Post first reported the nearly 500 incidents on Wednesday. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has warned Israel could carry out the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of Gaza if the international community does not make a determined stand to prevent it. Guterres made his appeal at a time of mounting civilian casualties from the Israeli bombardment of northern Gaza. A strike on Tuesday in Beit Lahiya district killed at least 93 people, in what the UN said was just one of at least seven \u201cmass casualty incidents\u201d across Gaza in the past week. At the same time, aid deliveries to Gaza are reported to have fallen to their lowest level since the start of the war, leading to growing allegations that Israel\u2019s true intention is to drive the remaining Palestinian population out of at least part of Gaza. The UN secretary general, speaking on the sidelines of the COP16 biodiversity conference in Colombia, suggested that the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of Gaza had been prevented until now by its people\u2019s refusal to succumb to the intense pressure to flee their homes and by Arab resolve not to accept mass population transfers. \u201cThe intention might be for the Palestinians to leave Gaza, for others to occupy it,\u201d Guterres told the Guardian. \u201cBut there has been \u2013 and I pay tribute to the courage and the resilience of the Palestinian people and to the determination of the Arab world \u2013 [an effort] to avoid the ethnic cleansing becoming a reality.\u201d \u201cWe will do everything possible to help them remain there and to avoid ethnic cleansing that might occur if there is not strong determination from the international community,\u201d he added. You can read the full report by Patrick Greenfield in Cali, Malak A Tantesh in Gaza and Julian Borger in Jerusalem here: Israeli strikes on the West Bank\u2019s Nur Shams refugee camp on Thursday killed two Palestinians including a child, Reuters reports, citing the Palestinian health ministry. One Palestinian was shot and killed by the Israeli army overnight in West Bank\u2019s refugee camp of Tulkarm, the health ministry added. The Israeli army said on Thursday it was conducting an operation targeting \u201cterrorist infrastructure\u201d in Nur Shams. Official Palestinian news agency Wafa said a large number of Israeli vehicles and heavy bulldozers stormed the city and headed towards the Nur Shams refugee camp. According to Reuters, the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) movement, al-Quds Brigades, said in a statement they detonated a highly explosive bomb in a military bulldozer to thwart the Israeli army\u2019s raid. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister has expressed hope that a ceasefire deal with Israel could be reached within days, after Hezbollah\u2019s new leader Naim Qassem said the militant group could agree to a possible truce under certain parameters. In his first public comments a day after being named to replace former longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, Qassem said however that Israel had yet to agree to any proposal that could be discussed, and that the Iran-backed group will keep fighting until it is offered terms it deems acceptable. \u201cIf the Israelis decide to stop the aggression, we say that we accept, but according to the conditions that we see as suitable,\u201d Qassem said, speaking from an undisclosed location in a pre-recorded televised address. \u201cWe will not beg for a ceasefire.\u201d It came as Israel\u2019s security cabinet met to discuss a possible truce, but also as Israel expanded their bombardment of the group\u2019s bastions, attacking the eastern Lebanese city of Baalbek, and said it had killed another senior Hezbollah commander. Lebanese caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati said he had previously not believed a deal would be possible until after Tuesday\u2019s US presidential election. But he said he became cautiously optimistic after speaking on Wednesday with the Biden administration\u2019s Middle East envoy Amos Hochstein, who was due to travel to Israel on Thursday. \u201cHochstein, during his call with me, suggested to me that we could reach an agreement before the end of the month and before November 5th,\u201d Mikati told Lebanon\u2019s Al Jadeed television. Israel\u2019s public broadcaster Kan published what it said was a draft agreement providing for an initial 60-day truce. The document, which the broadcaster said was a leaked proposal written by Washington, said Israel would withdraw its forces from Lebanon within the first week of the 60-day ceasefire. It largely aligned with details reported earlier by Reuters. Although negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah have made significant progress in the last 24 hours, the Biden administration has not reached a final agreement with either Israel or Lebanon, Axios reported citing two US officials with direct knowledge of the matter. The draft published by Kan was dated Saturday. When asked to comment, White House national security spokesperson Sean Savett said: There are many reports and drafts circulating. They do not reflect the current state of negotiations.\u201d In other developments: The Israeli army launched heavy airstrikes on the eastern city of Baalbek, famed for its Roman temples, and nearby villages. Tens of thousands of Lebanese, including many who sought shelter in Baalbek from other areas, fled after an Israeli evacuation warning. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said 19 people were killed in Israeli strikes on two towns in the Baalbek area on Wednesday. After the airstrikes, the Israeli military said it had targeted Hezbollah fuel reservoirs in the Bekaa valley region. In his first remarks as leader, Nassim Qassem said the series of blows dealt to the group in recent weeks had \u201churt\u201d Hezbollah, but asserted that the group had been able to reorganise its ranks swiftly after Nasrallah\u2019s death. \u201cHezbollah\u2019s capabilities are still available and compatible with a long war,\u201d he said. Qassem said he would stick to the war strategy laid out by his predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by Israel last month after full-scale fighting broke out. \u201cMy work programme is a continuation of the work programme of our leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah,\u201d Qassem said, pledging to press on with \u201cthe war plan that he [Nasrallah] developed with the leadership\u201d of the Iran-backed group. Donald Trump promised that he will bring \u201cpeace\u201d to the Middle East, with the US Republican nominee for president making the pronouncement in a letter just six days before the US election for the White House on 5 November. \u201cDuring my administration, we had peace in the Middle East, and we will have peace again very soon!\u201d he said in his letter to Lebanese Americans. At least 30 people were killed as Israel pummeled Gaza with new bombardments, Palestinian medics said. Eight of today\u2019s victims were killed in northern Gaza. The area Israel hit is near to where medics said at least 93 people had been killed or reported missing on Tuesday in an Israeli strike Washington called \u201chorrifying\u201d. The UN security council \u201cstrongly warned against any attempts to dismantle or diminish\u201d the operations and mandate of the UN Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, after Israel passed a law banning its operations. In a statement adopted by consensus, the 15-member body expressed grave concern over the legislation adopted by the Israeli parliament on Monday. The Israeli army said it had killed the deputy head of Hezbollah\u2019s elite Radwan force, Mustafa Ahmad Shahadi, in a strike in the Nabatieh area of south Lebanon. \u201cIn an intelligence-directed strike, the Israeli air force struck and eliminated Mustafa Ahmad Shahadi, deputy commander of Hezbollah\u2019s Radwan forces, in the area of Nabatieh,\u201d the army said in a statement. At least 43,163 Palestinians have been killed and 101,510 injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said. The ministry said on Wednesday that 102 Palestinians had been killed and 287 injured in the past 24 hours. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah group said it had launched drones at an Israeli base in the port city of Haifa. Hezbollah fighters \u201claunched an air attack at 7.45am (0545 GMT) \u2026 with a squadron of attack drones\u201d on a \u201cbase in southern Haifa\u201d, the group said in a statement."

            "date": "2024-10-22T23:01:01Z",
            "content": "The global rise of populism and \u201cstrongmen\u201d has led to an increase in authoritarianism in Africa that is holding back progress in governance, the businessman and philanthropist Mo Ibrahim has said. According to the latest edition of the Ibrahim index of African governance, 78% of Africa\u2019s citizens live in a country where security and democracy deteriorated between 2014 and 2023. \u201cAfrica is not disconnected from what\u2019s going on around the world and you can see the global order is breaking down everywhere,\u201d Ibrahim told the Guardian. \u201cYou can see many people breaching international law with impunity.\u201d \u201cI think the moral threshold is coming down, unfortunately, globally, and that applies to us in this part of the world. Look how many \u2018strongmen\u2019 we have around the world. Now it\u2019s been normalised.\u201d The report said the result had been a stalling of progress in governance across Africa, with effects on health and education, though the results were not uniform across the continent, with half the countries experiencing deteriorating overall governance and the other half seeing progress. The study, which is published every two years, measures the performance of African governments in the fields of security and law; participation, rights and inclusion; economic opportunity; and human development, which includes health and education. While the worst deterioration in the measures studied was in security and safety, democracy, including participation, rights and transparency, also deteriorated. A large part of this deterioration was due to crackdowns on freedom of assembly \u2013 with people in 29 countries having \u201csubstantially\u201d less freedom to come together and share ideas \u2013 as well as on civil society and freedom of speech, especially in digital spaces. In the sub-category of security and safety, more than half the continent\u2019s population saw violence increase over the last five years. The lack of security was slowing progress for economic opportunity as well as in health, education, social protections and sustainability. The report highlighted 11 countries \u201con a concerning decade-long trend of deterioration\u201d, including Sudan \u2013 where the continuing conflict has caused what the UN described as \u201cone of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history\u201d \u2013 as well as the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Sahel region. Decade-long deteriorations were also seen in high-ranked countries. Mauritius (in second place), Botswana (fifth), Namibia (sixth), and Tunisia (ninth), though still ranking in 2023 among the 10 highest-scoring countries, also featured among the most deteriorated countries from 2014 to 2023. However, the report also highlighted rapid progress in overall governance by countries such as Seychelles, which now tops the index, Morocco, Ivory Coast, Benin and Angola. The report also said there was strong progress in infrastructure \u2013 thanks to the spread of mobile communications, internet and energy access \u2013 as well as women\u2019s equality, with better laws protecting women from violence, and better perception and representation of women in politics and leadership. Despite signs of progress in many countries, the public perception of how well governments are performing has dropped, especially in relation to economic opportunities, security and poverty. Ibrahim said this could be due to heightened expectations and also greater access to information from other parts of the world. \u201cThis is a problem, because if the perception keeps going down, this means people are getting more and more dissatisfied \u2026 That generates stress in society and that leads to conflicts and other things,\u201d said Ibrahim."

            "date": "2024-10-31T06:00:09Z",
            "content": "Governments risk another decade of failure on biodiversity loss, due to the slow implementation of an international agreement to halt the destruction of Earth\u2019s ecosystems, experts have warned. Less than two years ago, the world reached a historic agreement at the Cop15 summit in Montreal to stop the human-caused destruction of life on our planet. The deal included targets to protect 30% of the planet for nature by the end of the decade (30x30), reform $500bn (then \u00a3410bn) of environmentally damaging subsidies, and begin restoring 30% of the planet\u2019s degraded ecosystems. But as country representatives dig into their second week of negotiations at Cop16 in Cali, Colombia \u2013 their first meeting since Montreal \u2013 alarm is growing at the lack of concrete progress on any of the major targets they agreed upon. An increasing number of indicators show that governments are not on track. They still need to protect an area of land equivalent to the combined size of Brazil and Australia, and an expanse of sea larger than the Indian Ocean to meet the headline 30x30 target, according to a new UN report. Weak progress on funding for nature and almost no progress on subsidy reform have also frustrated observers. At the time of publication, 158 countries are yet to submit formal plans on how they are going to meet the targets, according to Carbon Brief, missing their deadline this month ahead of the biodiversity summit in Cali, where governments are not likely to set a new deadline. \u201cProgress has been too slow. I think political prioritisation of nature is still too low. This is reflected by progress on the targets. Several target are very easy to measure: 30x30 has metrics on area and quality, finance has a dollar figure. We have new data on both that show we\u2019re not on pace,\u201d said Brian O\u2019Donnell, director of the Campaign for Nature. \u201cThis is a moment to demonstrate seriousness and build trust. On finance especially, it\u2019s been disturbing at times to go to parties to ask for their path forward for finance and be treated as if we are asking for something new or unrealistic, as opposed to what they just agreed two years ago. To me, that is a reflection of not a true commitment to this,\u201d he said. The world has never met a target to stem the destruction of wildlife and life-sustaining ecosystems. Amid growing scientific warnings about the state of life on Earth, there has been a major push to make sure this decade is different, and that governments comply with targets designed to prevent wildlife extinctions, such as cuts to pesticides use and pollution. Leading figures in conservation and science have raised concerns about the progress governments are making towards the targets in Cali. Martin Harper, CEO of Birdlife International, said meaningful action on commitments was vital. \u201cWe cannot accept inaction as the new normal. This means more action to bolster efforts to recover threatened species, to protect and restore more land, fresh water and sea, and to transform our food, energy and industrial systems. We have five years to raise hundreds of billions of dollars. If we don\u2019t see it materialise, I dread to think where we will be in 2030,\u201d he said. Inger Andersen, the UN environment head, said it was too early to say whether governments were not doing enough to meet the targets, underscoring that many were working hard. She said there had been signs of progress, but acknowledged more needed to be done. \u201cThe world is working on it. Will we meet every single target by 2030? I hope. If we don\u2019t, is that a catastrophe? No, but did we make a promise to each other that we are going to stretch and do the very best that we can,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still have six years to go.\u201d Scientists at the nature summit in Cali said that the political pace was not matching the scale of the challenge. Nathalie Seddon, professor of biodiversity at University of Oxford, said much more was needed by the end of the decade. \u201cThe biodiversity goals\u2019 2030 deadline exists for a reason: biodiverse, resilient ecosystems are the foundation of our economies and wellbeing. A bad outcome here isn\u2019t just bad news for wildlife; it undermines food security, water quality, disaster resilience and economic stability. It worsens climate impacts of record-breaking heat, wildfires, floods and droughts,\u201d she said. Yadvinder Malhi, a professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cThe very limited progress we\u2019ve seen so far in the negotiations at Cop16 is insufficient to address the very real implications of getting this wrong. Biodiversity is continuing to decline at an alarming rate. I really hope that the crunch discussions this week yield those commitments, for the sake of a flourishing future for people and for our planet.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features"

            "content": "The co-founder of the \u00a34bn British tech firm Darktrace, Poppy Gustafsson, has been appointed as the government\u2019s new investment minister. Darktrace, the listed cybersecurity company, was this month sold to a US private equity firm and Gustafsson stepped down as chief executive. She will become a peer. Ministers had been trying to appoint someone to the crucial job for months. Ben Wegg-Prosser, who founded the Global Counsel advisory firm with the Labour grandee Peter Mandelson, turned the job down. The government said Gustafsson would head the Office for Investment as a minister in the Treasury and the Department of Business and Trade. She will also preside over a new unit drawn from those departments and No 10, plus a new external advisory board. Keir Starmer said: \u201cI am delighted to welcome Poppy Gustafsson OBE as our new investment minister \u2013 an accomplished entrepreneur who brings invaluable experience to the role. \u201cWe\u2019re upgrading the Office for Investment to ensure it is fit for purpose and has the capability it needs to make the UK the first choice for investment and the best place in the world to do business, which is central to our mission to drive growth and make people better off.\u201d Gustafsson, one of the best-known figures in the UK tech industry, founded Darktrace in Cambridge in 2013 with backing from the late billionaire Mike Lynch\u2019s Invoke Capital. Like many of Darktrace\u2019s management and key staff, Gustafsson, who co-founded the firm when she was 30, was a former employee at Lynch\u2019s software company Autonomy. The 59-year-old Lynch and six others died last month when a superyacht sank off the coast of Sicily in a storm. Darktrace\u2019s time as a publicly listed company has been dogged by controversy and a number of short-sellers. Analysts have criticised the business model as sales over substance. Some of the criticism, which led to Darktrace\u2019s share price plummeting to record lows, prompted Gustafsson to publish a 1,200-word defence of the company last year in which she said it was run with the \u201cgreatest integrity\u201d. Gustafsson is expected to join the prime minister at a council of nations and regions meeting on Friday."

            "content": "The government has said its first international investment summit since Labour\u2019s general election landslide has secured a total of \u00a363bn of pledges to plough money into the British economy. The investments announced, which include the \u00a363bn of private-sector promises as well as public investment, include: \u00a36.3bn on datacentres, including a \u00a31.9bn datacentre campus at Didcot in Oxfordshire. \u00a321.7bn on carbon capture and storage, spread over 25 years. This public funding, announced in the run-up to the summit, is expected to leverage in \u00a38bn of private sector investment. \u00a324bn on clean energy. This pledge, announced last week, will see Scottish Power\u2019s Spanish owner, Iberdrola, double its green power investment over five years. More than \u00a33bn on transport infrastructure, including DP World investing up to \u00a31bn in its London Gateway container port operation, after a controversial row with the transport secretary, Louise Haigh. Manchester Airports Group is investing more than \u00a31.1bn in London Stansted airport. \u00a327.8bn in public investment, representing the total funds managed as Labour\u2019s national wealth fund is merged with the existing UK Infrastructure Bank. The combined entity will be based in Leeds."

            "date": "2024-10-18T16:18:46Z",
            "content": "One of Britain\u2019s largest care home chains, Care UK, has been sold to an American property investment company, the Guardian can reveal, in a deal that comes as private providers lobby the government for a greater role in the NHS. Care UK, which operates more than 150 residential homes for older people, has been the subject of sale speculation since 2018. The private equity firm Bridgepoint Advisers, which paid \u00a3420m for the company in 2010, had previously tried and failed to sell the chain, which employs about 10,500 staff and was founded in 1982. It said in its 2019 accounts that it had spent \u00a32.5m on financial advice for an \u201cabortive\u201d sale process. But Bridgepoint has now succeeded in selling the business to Welltower, a US real-estate investment trust (REIT) that specialises in care homes, according to Companies House filings. Neither Bridgepoint nor Welltower appear to have announced the deal to shareholders and it is not yet clear how much the US firm paid. But publicly available documents show that Care UK paid off a series of loans to HSBC shortly before the takeover took place. Care UK\u2019s accounts show it had more than \u00a3300m in bank loans. The deal comes as independent healthcare providers launched a charm offensive with the government, offering to provide their services to clear the NHS backlog. In a letter to the Treasury, the Independent Healthcare Providers Network (IHPN), which represents private healthcare groups including Care UK, said its members could provide up to \u00a31bn of capacity to help ease the crisis. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, has previously said the Labour government would \u201cgo further than [Tony Blair\u2019s] New Labour ever did\u201d in making use of private health firms. Care UK has invoiced central and local government for more than \u00a3840m of services since 2016, according to figures from the procurement data specialists Tussell. The business lost \u00a32.6m last year on revenues of \u00a3490m, compared with a \u00a34.4m profit in 2022. Bridgepoint is listed on the London Stock Exchange but had not announced the sale to investors as of Friday afternoon. A notice officially announcing that Bridgepoint no longer had control of the company was posted on 16 October. Three Welltower employees had already been installed as directors two weeks earlier, including the head of its London office, Jorge Charro. The deal does not include Practice Plus Group, a leading provider of private hospitals and one of the largest NHS outsourcers. Bridgepoint separated the two businesses in 2019 and retains ownership of Practice Plus, which has won about \u00a33.5bn of government contracts since 2012, according to Tussell. The Guardian has approached Bridgepoint, Care UK and Welltower for comment."

            "date": "2024-10-19T06:00:10Z",
            "content": "About a quarter of the investment announced by the government at its summit this week appears to have been secured or initiated before Labour came to power. Ministers touted \u00a363bn of investment at the summit on Monday, where they hosted hundreds of company bosses in a showcase of the UK\u2019s pro-growth policies. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, trumpeted the \u201crecord-breaking investment total secured at today\u2019s summit\u201d, while Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, said: \u201cAfter the investments secured as part of this summit, my optimism for Britain burns brighter than ever.\u201d But a Guardian analysis suggests that \u00a316.5bn of that money had been secured before the election in July. One of the most valuable investments, publicised in a Department for Business and Trade (DBT) press release, was the asset management firm Blackstone\u2019s \u00a310bn to build a datacentre in Byth, Northumberland. However, the leader of Northumberland county council, Glen Sanderson, told the Guardian that the deal had first been announced by the Conservative-run council in April. He said it came as a surprise that the government had not credited the council. The department also announced \u00a32.5bn in investment from CyrusOne, a US datacentre developer. Plans for one of the CyrusOne datacentres were submitted to local authorities in 2022. Another \u00a31.9bn datacentre investment, by the US company CloudHQ, appears to have been in development since 2018. A DBT source stressed that while some of the details of projects were made public by the companies while the Conservatives were in office, the final investment announcements were accelerated under this government. Another announcement was that the Turkish conglomerate Eren Holdings had confirmed a \u00a31bn investment in the redevelopment of Shotton Mill in Deeside, north Wales. However, local authorities had approved the plans for the expansion in 2022. The US nuclear engineering company Holtec was said to have made an investment of \u00a3325m in a new factory in South Yorkshire that would create hundreds of jobs. But the investment appears to have been planned before Labour came into government. The BBC reported in May that Holtec had shortlisted four sites in England for the factory and would make a final decision in autumn. A new battery storage development in Hampshire listed as one of the deals secured at the summit had already been announced by BW Group in April last year. Imperial College London\u2019s WestTech Corridor project, a hub for science, technology and innovation, also featured on the list of investments, but had first been announced in March, months before Labour took power. A government spokesperson said: \u201cEach deal announced at our record-breaking international investment summit were new, firm commitments being made by companies to invest in the UK as a result of actions taken by this government. \u201cThe leaders of many of these companies have hailed our approach as a driving factor behind their decision to contribute to the \u00a363bn of investment and nearly 38,000 jobs, delivering economic growth in every part of the UK.\u201d The industry minister, Sarah Jones, told the Commons after the summit: \u201c\u00a363bn doesn\u2019t lie.\u201d Addressing the Tory former business minister Kevin Hollinrake, Jones said: \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that our summit on Monday was organised in a matter of weeks \u2026 yet we secured double the amount of investment compared to their summit last year.\u201d The department also highlighted a new \u00a3130m development by the consumer healthcare company Haleon in its announcement. However, the company announced in May that it would close one of its UK factories, leading to 435 job losses, and move production to Slovakia. Monday\u2019s summit was hosted at the 15th-century Guildhall in the heart of the City of London and attended by hundreds of bosses from global companies including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock and HSBC. Executives were treated to an exclusive reception with King Charles, food prepared by the three-star Michelin chef Clare Smyth and a live performance from Elton John."

            "date": "2024-10-28T15:00:42Z",
            "content": "More than 30 years have passed since President Bill Clinton persuaded Congress to ratify the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and yet the trade agreement still infuriates many voters and hangs over Kamala Harris\u2019s \u2013 and the Democrats\u2019 \u2013 chances in this year\u2019s elections. Zombie-like, Nafta just keeps coming back, decades after many Democrats believe it should have died. At the Republican convention, Donald Trump attacked Nafta, calling it \u201cthe worst trade agreement ever\u201d. In speech after speech, Nafta is a topic Trump turns to as he seeks to woo the voters in the pivotal blue-collar communities of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 many of whom remain angry about the job losses it caused. There were early warning signs. \u201cA lot of people were saying Nafta was going to be a disaster economically,\u201d said David Bonior, a former Democratic congressman from Michigan who led the congressional fight to defeat Clinton\u2019s push for Nafta. \u201cI could see it was going to be a disaster politically, too.\u201d Nafta acted like a slow-motion poison for Democrats. After Congress ratified it in 1993, year by year more factories closed and more jobs disappeared as manufacturers moved operations to Mexico to take advantage of that country\u2019s lower wages. The Economic Policy Institute, a progressive thinktank, estimates that the US lost 682,000 jobs due to Nafta, which largely eliminated tariffs between the US, Mexico and Canada. \u201cIt\u2019s a lingering issue in Michigan,\u201d said Ron Bieber, president of the Michigan AFL-CIO, the US\u2019s largest federation of unions. \u201cEveryone knows someone here in Michigan who lost their job due to Nafta. The door was cracked open to outsourcing before Nafta, but Nafta threw the door open after it was passed.\u201d JJ Jewell, who works at a Ford axle plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan, was born two years before Nafta was ratified. The trade pact has been part of the background of his life, he says. Jewell said he often discussed trade problems with other auto workers, even when they didn\u2019t directly discuss Nafta. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue,\u201d he said. \u201cNafta helped expedite the loss of jobs from our country to a country where wages are cheaper. I have friends, family members, neighbors who lost their jobs as a direct result of Nafta. It still affects things decades later.\u201d While Trump talks tough on trade and protecting factory jobs, Jewell said that Trump, while president, fell badly short in his vows to bring back manufacturing jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s empty promises,\u201d he said. Liz Shuler, the president of the AFL-CIO, the country\u2019s main labor federation, agreed, saying that Trump\u2019s tough words on trade have done little for workers. \u201cThis is an example of Trump\u2019s rhetoric not matching reality,\u201d Shuler said. \u201cHe talks a good game, but there\u2019s no action to back it up. When he had the ability to make a difference, when he was president, he went to different places and pretended to be a savior, and you followed up and you saw that those plants closed and jobs were moved to Mexico. He did nothing to fix it.\u201d Seeing all the lingering discontent about Nafta, many Democrats say it\u2019s unfair for Trump and others to blame their party for the agreement. The idea for Nafta arose under Ronald Reagan, they say, and George HW Bush negotiated the deal, both Republicans. More Republicans in Congress voted to ratify Nafta than Democrats. The vast majority of Senate Republicans also voted for it, while most Democratic senators voted against ratification. Still, Bonior said that Clinton and his administration \u201cget the blame because their top guy was for it\u201d, he said. \u201cClinton was instrumental in making it happen.\u201d Many workers who lost jobs due to Nafta were able to find other jobs, said Bonior, but their pay was 20% less on average. \u201cLifestyles were enormously downgraded in my district,\u201d said Bonior, who served as House majority whip. \u201cClinton bought into Nafta, but a lot of working-class people saw that as a betrayal.\u201d On Nafta, Clinton won strong backing from economists and corporate America. Brushing aside labor\u2019s warnings that Nafta would speed the loss of jobs to Mexico, nearly 300 economists on the right and the left, including several Nobel Prize winners, signed a pro-Nafta letter, saying: \u201cThe assertions that Nafta will spur an exodus of US jobs to Mexico are without basis.\u201d Many economists argued that Nafta would increase the number of manufacturing jobs in the US because the nation had a higher-skilled, more productive workforce than Mexico and would thus, in theory, gain factory jobs in an expanded free-trade zone. Pro-Nafta forces also argued that the closer economic integration of the US, Mexico and Canada would create a North American powerhouse to counter China\u2019s fast-growing economic power. Jeff Faux, a former president of the Economic Policy Institute, said many economists failed to realize something important that was happening when Nafta was negotiated: \u201cThe US was losing its manufacturing base. It was deindustrializing.\u201d Faux, one of the most outspoken economists against Nafta, said Clinton embraced Nafta because he was eager to present himself as a different type of Democrat and \u201cwas trying to ingratiate himself with the business community\u201d. \u201cClinton saw Nafta as an opportunity to present himself as not just another liberal Democrat,\u201d Faux said. \u201cIt was the beginning of the notion that came to dominate the Democratic party that its future is not in working people, that it\u2019s in professionals, in women, in minorities and various ethnic groups. They wanted to put together a new coalition, and labor would be a thing of the past.\u201d Michael Podhorzer, a former AFL-CIO political director, said many blue-collar workers remain angry about Nafta because it was such a departure from President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s emphatically pro-worker Democratic party. Podhorzer said: \u201cNafta is the catchall for a series of things that Democrats did that showed they had a greater concern for business interests and a kind of insensitivity to the consequences that accelerating deindustrialization would have on people\u2019s lives.\u201d Trump was shrewd to seize on Nafta, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s a way for him to sort of wave a flag, but it doesn\u2019t actually mean he\u2019s on the workers\u2019 side. It channels pretty effectively the frustration that many Americans feel in seeing their jobs go offshore or to Mexico or seeing their communities hollowed out or seeing fewer economics prospects for their kids.\u201d In the view of many labor leaders and workers, the Democrats doubled down on misguided trade policy when Clinton successfully pushed Congress in 2000 to approve normal trade relations with China. That move encouraged many US corporations to outsource operations to lower-wage China, with one study finding that the country lost 2m jobs, including 985,000 factory jobs, because of the normalized trade relations with China. The number of factories in the US also declined by 45,000 from 1997 to 2008, with many workers blaming Nafta and the China trade deal. What\u2019s more, many unions faulted Barack Obama for pushing for another free trade agreement: the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a pact with 12 Pacific Rim countries. TPP\u2019s supporters said the deal would increase US exports and build a powerful economic bloc to counter China. TPP was signed in 2016 under Obama\u2019s presidency, but soon after Trump became president, he withdrew the US from TPP, preventing it from taking force. \u201cObama wasn\u2019t great shakes on trade either,\u201d Bonior said. \u201cA lot of working people said they had enough. They decided we\u2019re not going to be with the Democrats any more, and Trump came along and filled the void. That was very smart for Trump to do.\u201d In a 2016 campaign appearance in Pittsburgh, Trump made a major speech on trade that denounced Nafta and cited several Economic Policy Institute studies that criticized the trade pact. Lawrence Mishel, who was the institute\u2019s president at the time, said: \u201cTrump never really explained what he would do about Nafta or trade. He ended his speech with a call for deregulation and tax cuts for the rich, which was far more pro-Chamber of Commerce than pro-worker.\u201d While Joe Biden voted to ratify Nafta when he was a senator, labor leaders say the president\u2019s current pro-worker stance on trade shows that he recognizes his Nafta vote was a mistake. For Bonior, it might be too little too late. \u201cBiden has been very good on working-class issues. Biden is trying to make up for his vote on Nafta,\u201d Bonior said. \u201cBut a lot of working-class people are turned off so much to the Democrats that they\u2019re not hearing of the things Biden and Harris have done for them. They\u2019re not listening. They\u2019re gone. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever get them back. \u201cThey\u2019re to some degree mesmerized by Trump even though Trump has never been for working people,\u201d Bonior continued. \u201cThose plants he said he would restore \u2013 he never did any of that.\u201d Many union leaders slam Trump for a speech he gave in Youngstown in which he told thousands of workers that he would bring back all the factory jobs that Ohio had lost. \u201cThey\u2019re all coming back,\u201d he said. They didn\u2019t. And when General Motors closed its huge assembly plant in nearby Lordstown, Ohio, in 2019, Trump did little to stop the plant closing or bring back the lost jobs. \u201cHe said all those jobs would be coming back, and then he did nothing,\u201d said Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers (UAW). \u201cThe auto industry abandoned Lordstown, and Trump did nothing.\u201d When Trump was running for president in 2016, he vowed to renegotiate Nafta, and he followed through, reaching a new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2018. Labor leaders had attacked Nafta not only for encouraging companies to move factory jobs to Mexico and but also for failing to effectively protect Mexican workers whose employers had violated their right to unionize or other rights. Union leaders agree that USMCA created a stronger mechanism to crack down on labor violations by Mexican companies, although the Trump administration negotiated that improved enforcement mechanism only after the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and House Democrats demanded that Trump go further in the negotiations. But under USMCA, often called \u201cNafta 2.0\u201d, US companies have continued moving manufacturing operations to Mexico. Even though USMCA made only minor changes to Nafta, Trump called it, \u201cthe best trade deal ever made\u201d. For her part, Harris was one of 10 senators to vote against USMCA, saying it didn\u2019t improve Nafta sufficiently. Faux said many workers applaud Trump on trade because \u201che did something\u201d about it by renegotiating Nafta, while \u201cthe Democrats did nothing\u201d. Labor leaders have differing views of USMCA. David McCall, president of the Pittsburgh-based United Steelworkers, said: \u201cI think Nafta 2.0 was helpful. It\u2019s gotten some better labor protections.\u201d But the UAW\u2019s Fain was merciless in attacking USMCA. \u201cI like to call it Trump\u2019s Nafta,\u201d Fain said. \u201cTrump\u2019s Nafta only made problems worse. Trump\u2019s Nafta only gave the billionaires more profits. Trump\u2019s Nafta only killed more American jobs. Trump\u2019s Nafta only shipped more work to Mexico.\u201d Both Harris and Trump say they will renegotiate USMCA if elected. Trump also says he will protect factory jobs by imposing a 20% tariff on all imports, but the Steelworkers\u2019 McCall says that\u2019s a terrible idea. \u201cI don\u2019t think the solution to the problem is to have tariffs for the sake of having tariffs,\u201d McCall said. \u201cThat\u2019s protection. I think trade is a good thing. It\u2019s an economic stimulator.\u201d He said the US should use tariffs not in a blunderbuss way, but to \u201cpunish cheaters or countries that dump their various products\u201d. McCall said the Biden-Harris administration had had a far better strategy for protecting factory jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time in generations that we\u2019ve had an industrial policy in this country,\u201d he said, praising three important laws passed under Biden: the infrastructure law, the green energy law and the Chips Act to encourage semiconductor production. McCall said those laws, along with Biden\u2019s targeted tariffs \u201cagainst countries that cheat\u201d, give the US \u201can opportunity to be the most productive producers of many products\u201d. While many blue-collar workers like Trump\u2019s views on trade, McCall said: \u201cHe\u2019s not a friend of unions or labor. For Trump it\u2019s all about him, not about the person that\u2019s working on the job: the steelworker, the electrical worker, the teamster or the UAW member.\u201d"

Here were the major developments of the day: The pro-Palestine vigil planned for 7 October will be going ahead after organisers revealed it has become a standing vigil, which does not require a form 1 application. The mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore, said \u201cshutting down protests is not the answer\u201d and called for protests to be allowed to go ahead, while the premier, Chris Minns, said that stopping the pro-Palestine and Lebanon rally planned for Sunday could protect Sydney\u2019s \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d. The Australian federal police is investigating nine complaints over alleged public displays of prohibited symbols in Victoria after weekend protests in Melbourne against Israel\u2019s attacks on Lebanon. Acclaimed pianist Jayson Gillham has filed legal proceedings against the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in the federal court. Gillham, whose performance with the MSO was cancelled after a dedication on stage to Palestinian journalists who had died in the Gaza conflict, alleged that he was \u201csilenced for speaking the truth \u2013 that Israel targets journalists\u201d. And the Australian National University has proposed a reorganisation of its academic structure, with vice-chancellor Prof Genevieve Bell admitting the university is facing \u201ca substantial financial challenge\u201d. Continued from previous post: A Greens spokesperson said the PWSS had been \u201cessential\u201d in supporting MPs and senators\u2019 offices to maintain safe workplaces \u201cdespite the challenging nature of political work\u201d. The PWSS is the independent service established after the Jenkins review into parliament\u2019s culture. The leader\u2019s office has no legal power to resolve disputes between staff and any individual Senator\u2019s office, and if any member of staff raises a complaint, they are encouraged and offered support to pursue it through the independent PWSS, and that occurred here. The Greens will not comment on any individual cases in relation to staff. Bandt cuts press conference short after being questioned about allegations of bullying against senator Greens leader Adam Bandt has cut a press conference in Perth short after declining to answer a series of questions about steps his office had made to investigate allegations made against the party\u2019s WA senator, Dorinda Cox. Bandt was responding to a Sydney Morning Herald report on alleged bullying by Cox. The report said 20 staff had quit her office in three years and that several had lodged formal complaints with the parliamentary workplace support service and Bandt\u2019s office alleging a hostile culture. Bandt told reporters any time a staff member came to him or his team with an issue, it was taken \u201cvery seriously\u201d, while neglecting to say whether Cox would keep her First Nations portfolio or if an investigation would be launched. Senator Dorinda Cox, who was not present at the press conference, told Guardian Australia she was \u201cvery proud\u201d of her team and the \u201chard-working people\u201d that had been a part of it since her election in 2022. I have continued to work respectfully and collaboratively with my colleagues and team, and will continue to work to incorporate a holistic work life balance to our offices. I continue to be very grateful to the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service (PWSS) for the work they do in helping offices across the country, including mine, despite what can be challenging circumstances both politically and personally. Continued in next post. NSW Greens: democracy has \u2018won the day\u2019 The New South Wales Greens have backed the supreme court\u2019s decision for a pro-Palestine protest to go ahead as a vigil, declaring democracy has \u201cwon the day\u201d. Earlier, it was revealed a NSW police application to prohibit pro-Palestine assemblies in Sydney on 6 and 7 October had failed. Following a day of hearings and negotiations between police and the Palestine Action Group (PAG), it was agreed the assemblies would go ahead as a vigil and police would withdraw its application. Greens MP and spokesperson for justice, Sue Higginson, said the NSW police force had used \u201cpoor judgment and use of public resources\u201d. Once again a grassroots community justice movement has stood up for and defended our democracy and the fundamental right to protest in the courts against the strong-arm of an emboldened law-and-order state. The right of all individuals to exercise freedom of speech and the right to assemble peacefully has won the day, but the reality is, it should never have been on trial. If protest was enshrined into law in NSW as it is in other states and territories, the NSW police force would not be so emboldened to attempt to remove these rights. The pro-Palestine vigil planned for 7 October will be going ahead after organisers revealed it has become a standing vigil, which does not require a form 1 application. They also revealed that the protest schedule for Sunday has been approved by police after organisers made changes to the route of the procession in last-minute negotiations. On the steps of the NSW supreme court, Amal Naser of the Palestine Action Group claimed victory in their stoush with NSW police, saying all of the plans will be going ahead. This is a good moment for democratic rights as well as the fight for Palestinian liberation. We ultimately got everything we wanted. We had a strong case and we were going to win anyway. We\u2019ve reached a good outcome, and it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been saying all along. We have the right to protest, and we need to protest now more than ever. The route we are marching is a route we have marched dozens of times before, and it\u2019s a route we are happy with. Thanks for your work Cait Kelly. It\u2019s Caitlin Cassidy here (Cait #2) until stumps. Parties engaged in \u2018good faith process\u2019 during difficult time, judge says In the supreme court, the parties have reached an agreement, but we are waiting for more detail on that. The summons was dismissed and there is about to be a press conference outside court. We will bring you that as it comes. Before court was adjourned, the judge said: Can I just say this, it is apparent to me from the evidence that over the course of the last typical 51 weeks, the commissioners, the defendants \u2026 have engaged in very difficult times, in a good faith process to seek to manage the balance, on the one hand, of a right to peaceful assembly with on the other hand, legitimate concerns about public safety. It is to the credit of the parties that they have done so. Melbourne Symphony Orchestra responds to news of legal action by pianist The MSO has responded to news pianist Jayson Gillham is taking action against it in the federal court. In a statement, MSO said: The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra has today been served with a statement of claim by Jayson Gillham commencing proceedings in the Federal Court. The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra is reviewing the court documents and will respond at the appropriate time. IMF: phasing out tax breaks could create a fairer tax system The International Monetary Fund has found \u201ctax breaks, including from capital gains tax discount and superannuation concessions, could be phased out to generate a more equitable and efficient tax system\u201d. In a statement, Greg Jericho, chief economist at the Australia Institute said: The IMF has just confirmed what everyone knows \u2013 the tax concessions on superannuation and the capital gains discount make Australia less fair and should be reformed. The capital gains discount and negative gearing have distorted Australia\u2019s housing market for a quarter of a century. As a result, home ownership rates are declining as fewer and fewer people can afford to buy a house. Reforming these tax concessions would allow more Australians to realise their ambitions of owning a home and make Australia a fairer country. Back in the NSW supreme court, Palestine Action Group spokesperson Josh Lees is being asked whether their marshals will be able to handle the planned protests on the weekend if they go ahead. Lees says \u201cthey\u2019ve managed very well\u201d if you look at the record of the past 50 weeks of protests. Lachlan Gyles, representing the police, suggested they had not managed a crowd \u201cof this nature\u201d where there was a lot of heightened emotions. Lees said: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. We\u2019ve been dealing with a whole series of very emotional and devastating moments. For the last year. Man charged over FriendlyJordies firebombing granted bail A man charged over the firebombing of Jordan Shanks-Markovina \u2013 better known by his online alias of FriendlyJordies \u2013 has been granted bail, AAP reports. Andre Stepanyan is one of two men charged over an alleged arson attack on Shanks-Markovina\u2019s Bondi home in November 2022. Stepanyan, who is charged with destroying property in company and participating in a criminal group, appeared for a bail hearing in the NSW supreme court on Thursday. The 38-year-old was allegedly the driver behind the wheel of a black Mercedes that took at least two passengers to the house. His lawyer Bianca Barnes said: I think an issue at trial is going to be whether or not he had any knowledge of what was happening. There was no evidence Stepanyan was associated with any criminal groups at the time of the firebombing in November 2022, Barnes added. Sydney Metro maintenance workers to strike on Friday morning over pay increases Maintenance workers on the Sydney Metro service are set to strike and picket the entrance of Tallawong metro station from 7am to 9am tomorrow after contractor Alstom\u2019s refusal to provide reasonable wage increases, the Australian Manufacturing Workers\u2019 Union says. AMWU NSW state organiser Nathan Everson said commuters needed safe, reliable transport and rail workers deserved a fair pay deal. Workers at Alstom have been maintaining rolling stock for the past five years, delivering an essential service to the community. The protected action will undoubtedly have an impact on the new service. Workers would prefer not to have to take protected industrial action, particularly following the NSW Government showcasing the new Metro service in August, but they don\u2019t feel as if they have a choice at this stage. Private contracting on major transport projects has become a prominent issue for our workforce. Workers are undervalued and unsafe as a result. This comes as no surprise considering how the Minns Government have been treating Nurses, Teachers, and Firies. Workers deserve better, commuters deserve better, and we call on the NSW government to step in and do something about it. Planned protest a \u2018tinderbox\u2019, police assistant commissioner tells Sydney court In the supreme court hearing on the pro-Palestine protest in Sydney this weekend, the assistant commissioner, Peter McKenna, who is the police commander for the area, said the situation was a \u201ctinderbox\u201d because the planned protest would go near the Great Synagogue in Sydney\u2019s CBD. McKenna: It would be provocative to re-enter near the Great Synagogue, especially given the significant number of people I expect. Hard for police to ensure public safety. Things that come to us that would see clear provocation or even placing people in positions where often it only takes one or two people to say the wrong thing \u2026 it could be a tinderbox and something significant we would have to deal with. It\u2019s understood the protest has previously gone near the synagogue. The AFP has put out a statement about protesters allegedly carrying photos of Hezbollah flags and portraits of leader Hassan Nasrallah during weekend protests in Melbourne against Israel\u2019s attacks on Lebanon. In a statement, the AFP said: The AFP\u2019s Counter Terrorism and Special Investigations Command (in Victoria) has established Operation Ardvarna, which is investigating nine complaints of allegedly publicly displayed prohibited symbols in Victoria while potentially inciting or advocating violence, or hatred, based on race and religion. The nine reports originate in Victoria and have been provided by Victoria Police (3) and to the National Security Hotline (1), Report of Crime (portal) (4) and proactive investigation into a media article (1) allegedly identifying an individual. It is likely the number of investigations will increase, and some state and territory police agencies have their own investigations underway. The process for AFP investigators includes triaging and assessing referrals, identifying persons of interest, developing investigation plans to assist ongoing investigations and to provide strategies for disruption and/or overt activity. While state and territory police agencies primarily focus on public order management for protests, the AFP has offered or is providing support to agencies ahead of expected protests over the coming days. The nine investigations undertaken by the AFP are a priority. However, the community can be assured that the AFP is also continuing to focus on its primary role that it does 365 days a year \u2013 that includes investigating and disrupting terrorism, radicalisation, foreign interference and espionage. The AFP is committed to keeping the community informed on protest investigations. The NSW supreme court hearing has returned. Lachlan Gyles, representing the police, said what they are effectively dealing with is an informal form 1, based on what is proposed. He said the difference between this and the prior proposal is \u201cthere is less controversy about it\u201d in terms of the \u201csuitability\u201d. He also said the \u201carea of contention is going to be much narrowed.\u201d Arjun Chhabra, representing the organisers, earlier said the 6 October protest would begin at Hyde Park, rather than Town Hall. He said clients were seeking protection, not authorisation for the 6 October rally. Because the onus is on plaintiff to obtain prohibition, as opposed to the defendant, currently, authorisation. Thanks for joining me on the blog today, Cait Kelly will take you through the rest of the NSW supreme court hearing \u2013 and the rest of our rolling coverage today. Take care. The court has adjourned for another 10 minutes. The hearing has now resumed in the NSW supreme court. Arjun Chhabra, representing the organisers, said part of the amended form 1 proposal included beginning the 6 October protest at Hyde Park, rather than Town Hall. He said organisers have abandoned their plans to hold a pro-Palestine vigil on Monday 7 October. Parties hoping resolution on Sunday\u2019s protest can be reached outside court In the NSW supreme court, senior counsel Lachlan Gyles \u2013 representing the police \u2013 said there has been a proposal for an \u201calternative manner of operation\u201d for Sunday\u2019s event, and parties wish to discuss whether a resolution may be able to be reached. Arjun Chhabra, representing the defendants, requested 15 minutes to discuss this. Justice Jeremy Kirk said the choice he had was \u201cbinary\u201d \u2013 either he makes a prohibition order or he does not. He recognised that there were \u201clegitimate and weighty concerns on both sides\u201d and having some discussion was \u201csensible\u201d, granting a 15-minute adjournment. Court will return at 2.20pm. Supreme court hearing begins The hearing has begun at the NSW supreme court into two events planned for 6 and 7 October, which the NSW police are attempting to prevent. A pro-Palestine rally is planned for Sunday, and a candlelight vigil for Monday, which is a public holiday in NSW. As Mostafa Rachwani reported yesterday, Sydney police told organisers they had safety concerns over the expected crowd size and potential hazards at Town Hall including \u201cthe recent addition of over a dozen planter boxes\u201d. But protest organisers have said the move to block events from going ahead was \u201ca political attack on our right to protest\u201d \u2013 and said pointing to the planter boxes was an \u201cobvious red herring\u201d. We\u2019ll bring you the latest as the hearing continues. A crowd of pro-Palestine protesters have gathered outside the NSW supreme court, with the hearing into NSW police\u2019s attempt to block the protest this weekend due at 2pm. People have arrived with banners and flags to show their support for the cause and to protest against the police submission to have the rallies organised for 6 and 7 October cancelled. Chants of \u201cFree, free Palestine\u201d and \u201cHands off Lebanon\u201d have started around the entrance to court. A traditional tablah drum has begun ringing out across the square, in time with the chanting. A strong police presence surrounds the entry to court, with members of the Palestine Action Group, the organisers of the rallies, due to arrive soon. Hybrid vehicles in fast lane as petrol cars slow down Motorists are putting the brakes on new vehicle purchases, with sales of petrol, diesel and electric cars slowing down significantly in Australia. But as AAP reports, hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicle sales continue to accelerate despite the downturn, and large vehicles remain the most popular models for consumers. Figures from the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries show petrol vehicle sales fell 17.5% during the month, diesel vehicles were down 12.3%, but hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles bucked the trend. Motorists bought more than 13,500 hybrid vehicles in September \u2013 a 34.4% rise compared to the same period in 2023 \u2013 and more than 2400 plug-in hybrid cars, representing a rise of 89.9%. A hybrid vehicle, the Toyota RAV4, also claimed the title of Australia\u2019s bestselling vehicle for September, followed by Ford Ranger and Toyota HiLux utes. Electric vehicles did not fare as well as their low-emission cohorts during the month. Combined sales figures from the FCAI and the Electric Vehicle Council showed Australians bought more than 6,400 EVs during the month, down 27%, which represented 6.6% of all new vehicle sales. Minns defends decision to attend vigil with Jewish community on 7 October The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, has defended his decision to attend a candlelight vigil on 7 October to show solidarity with the Jewish community, while insisting a vigil for Palestine planned for the same night should not go ahead. At his press conference earlier, Minns said he would go to the vigil with the Jewish community and that \u201csome\u201d Muslim leaders \u201cmay expect me\u201d to attend. So the suggestion that me attending a rally for the Jewish community would somehow upset the sensibilities of the Muslim community \u2013 there were many Muslim leaders in NSW that issued a public condemnation of that terrorist activity on that day, who were concerned about it [and] saw it as a crime, and offered sympathy and solidarity with the Jewish community in Sydney as a result. So some of them may expect me to be there. Minns said the organisers of the pro-Palestine and Lebanon vigil planned for Monday night had said in submitting the paperwork required to lawfully hold the gathering that they were expecting 200 people to attend. But he said a \u201creasonable person would suggest\u201d it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that only 200 people would go, and there was \u201cgenuine police scepticism\u201d that the event could be contained. Twelve months ago in Sydney, there was meant to be a vigil in the days following the October 7 terrorist attacks, this is prior to Israeli activity in Gaza. It ended up being an unlawful march through the streets and a major protest \u2013 some would term it violent protest \u2013 on the steps of the Opera House. I think that would cause huge harm to social harmony in NSW and it\u2019s reasonable for the government and the police to try and prevent those scenes being repeated. More than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, died on 7 October. More than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza, mostly civilians, one in 55 of the prewar population. More than 700 people have died in Lebanon in the recent wave of Israeli attacks. The lord mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore, has said \u201cshutting down protests is not the answer\u201d and has called for protests in Sydney to be allowed to go ahead. A pro-Palestine rally is scheduled for Sunday and a candlelight vigil for Monday, but the NSW police have brought a case to the supreme court to try to block these. The hearing kicks off at 2pm, in about half an hour. In a statement, Moore said: We don\u2019t approve or facilitate protests or rallies in our LGA \u2013 NSW Police are responsible for permits and ensuring safe management \u2013 but we stand ready to help. If we\u2019re required to move planter boxes to ensure safety, for example, we will. The community has been gathering, peacefully, every week for the past year. I know that larger crowds are expected this weekend, but I am hopeful that the Police permit and support the community to do so once again. The statement comes as an open letter has been signed by 42 human rights groups and community organisations, calling on the NSW police commissioner to facilitate the protests. Signatories include the Human Rights Law Centre, Community Legal Centres NSW, Amnesty International Australia, NSW Council for Civil Liberties, and Jewish Council of Australia. Aussie women say they\u2019re not educated on contraception The vast majority of Australian women fear they have insufficient education on contraception despite more than two-thirds opting to use some form of birth control, AAP reports. The fresh insight has been released by assistant minister for health and aged care, Ged Kearney, in the new national Contraceptive Choice 2024 survey. Of the more than 1,000 Australian women aged 18 to 45 questioned, 34% said they were not using any form of contraception. Seventy per cent said they believed they did not have correct or enough education on contraception and 32% of those under 24 regularly experienced anxiety about their current method. In the survey, 36% of women said they had experienced a pregnancy scare and 42% said they had taken emergency contraception. Among the barriers for women in trying a new method, 42% cited side effects while 21% were worried about costs and the time needed to switch methods. A separate 17% said they didn\u2019t know enough to make informed decisions about new options. Acclaimed pianist Jayson Gillham has filed legal proceedings against the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in the federal court. Gillham, whose performance with the MSO was cancelled after a dedication on stage to Palestinian journalists who had died in the Gaza conflict, alleged that he was \u201csilenced for speaking the truth \u2013 that Israel targets journalists\u201d. In a statement regarding the legal action, Gillham said: This situation goes beyond just artistic freedom; it strikes at the heart of our right to free speech and the role of art in addressing important social issues. The MSO\u2019s extreme reaction to factual statements highlights a disturbing trend of silencing voices that speak to uncomfortable truths. The pianist argues that MSO\u2019s actions constitute direct discrimination based on political belief, violating his human and workplace rights protected by the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (Victoria) and Fair Work Act 2009 (Commonwealth). Gillham said he was compelled to pursue legal action \u201cafter the MSO rejected reasonable requests to remedy the situation\u201d. He said: This battle is about ensuring that artists can perform with integrity and without fear of censorship or reprisal. More broadly, it\u2019s about defending everyone\u2019s right to express opinions on important issues without being silenced. The MSO has been contacted for comment. Returning to the press conference Chris Minns held earlier today, the NSW premier claimed that stopping the pro-Palestine and Lebanon rally planned for Sunday could protect Sydney\u2019s \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d. When a journalist put to Minns that the police wouldn\u2019t be able to stop people from congregating en masse in Sydney\u2019s CBD if they chose to go ahead with the protest, the premier said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t make that claim\u201d. I\u2019m not going to go through chapter and verse what police tactics will be. But it does give the police the power to ensure that a mobile protest doesn\u2019t take place through Sydney streets as it would be an unauthorised march. And that may be important in protecting critical infrastructure for the city, or ensuring that we don\u2019t have an unfortunate conflict on Sydney\u2019s streets. NSW police have vowed to stop a protest planned for Sunday 6 October and a candlelight vigil scheduled for Monday 7 October from going ahead. Two peregrine falcon chicks hatch at Collins Street skyscraper in Melbourne Two peregrine falcon chicks have hatched in Melbourne, witnessed by all who watch the iconic Collins Street live feed. The two chicks hatched early this morning, as observed on the live feed. The mother is currently huddling over her chicks, dutifully waiting for a third to hatch. Peregrine falcons have treated a ledge on top of 367 Collins Street as home for more than three decades, but cameras made them a social media phenomenon. The cameras were turned back on in August for the new breeding season, as the first egg was laid. As Adeshola Ore reported, last year\u2019s eggs were unable to hatch after the female stopped incubating, likely due to a territorial dispute \u2013 but there was high hopes for this season. You can follow along with the livestream here, or read more about the yearly tradition below: Australians in Lebanon facing difficult decisions as authorities urge them to leave Australians are being urged to leave Lebanon and take up offers of more than 500 extra commercial airline seats, but for some families, it\u2019s not that simple. AAP has spoken with one Lebanese Australian, who wished to remain anonymous for privacy reasons, who described the heartbreak and emotional toll of worrying about her relatives. Both sides of her family are from Lebanon, with three generations living across Beirut and the nation\u2019s north. Thankfully, those in the mountainous north are safe, she says, but a full-scale invasion could change this. \u201cThose in Beirut are going hour by hour, day by day,\u201d she told AAP through tears, saying the airstrikes were not in their areas, but they could hear the constant explosions. Some of our relatives are elderly and frail and won\u2019t be able to leave. No one in my family would travel out here and leave their mothers, their fathers, their cousins, their aunts, the elderly. Her family would \u201cmove heaven and earth\u201d to evacuate elderly people to the northern village they\u2019re from, but this may not be feasible even in the worst-case scenario due to the 24-hour care requirement they\u2019re receiving in Beirut, she said. Qantas freight workers will be almost $7,000 a year better off thanks to a deal struck by the Australian Services Union (ASU) which would see the wages of Australian Air Express workers lifted to match those of their Qantas Freight counterparts. ASU national secretary Emeline Gaske said the deal was another win for the union\u2019s \u201csame job, same pay\u201d campaign: Workers at Australian Air Express, a wholly owned Qantas subsidiary, work alongside their colleagues at Qantas Freight doing identical work every day. Yet those working for Australia Air Express have been receiving significantly lower wages than their counterparts at Qantas. For far too long, employment loopholes like these have been exploited by unscrupulous employers to short-change workers, and it\u2019s time these dodgy arrangements ended. Queensland police have faced questions on 4BC Radio about the naming of a man by Chinese media outlets as someone who allegedly poured hot coffee on a baby in Brisbane. A warrant was previously issued for the arrest of a 33-year-old foreign national, accused of the alleged attack at Hanlon Park in Stones Corner on 27 August. QPS acting assistant commissioner Andrew Massingham was asked about the Chinese media outlets reports, and said the international search is continuing. Sometimes these posts can be a distraction to what we\u2019re attempting to achieve, but that search will continue until we locate that person. Asked if the reports would affect the investigation, Massingham responded: Those things always need to remain confidential up until the time we go public with the information. In a statement, Queensland police said they were \u201cunable to provide any further information or context around this investigation at this time\u201d. Here\u2019s some more details from Peter Hannam on the latest International Monetary Fund assessment report, which said extra government spending could inject \u201cadditional stimulus\u201d into the Australian economy and risk the RBA having to lift interest rates: LNP leader makes health announcement as Labor premier forgets candidates\u2019 name Queensland premier Steven Miles and opponent David Crisafulli have spent another day in the regions. Miles made a major gaffe in Mirani, near Rockhampton, when he forgot the name of the local Labor candidate, Susan Teder. The Labor leader held press conferences yesterday and today in the Katter\u2019s Australian party-held electorate without her. Miles said he would \u201cfind out\u201d where she was, before being prompted by deputy leader Cameron Dick. Meanwhile, LNP leader David Crisafulli stayed in the Rockhampton area for the second day straight, where he made a youth mental health commitment. Crisafulli said he would spend $50m building two new step-up step-down clinics, one of them in central Queensland: The reason why is there\u2019s currently no facilities for young people between Cairns and Brisbane that\u2019s a very, very big area, and to have a dedicated one in Rockhampton is a big step forward in acknowledging how serious the challenges are and how vast that distance is, and also the pressures that the Rockhampton hospital is under. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, has said the candlelight vigil scheduled for 7 October in Sydney should not go ahead. Speaking to reporters earlier, he said: We remain committed to the idea that holding a protest on Monday \u2013 which is obviously the anniversary of October 7, which was a devastating terrorist attack on Israel and has had huge ramifications for those who live in Sydney who are concerned about family, friends and community members in that part of the world \u2013 is not the right thing to do. [It\u2019s] hugely unsympathetic to those who are going through pain at the moment and not in keeping or in recognition of the fact that, yes, there\u2019s have been protests taking place in Sydney, but surely one of the other 364 days of the year would be more appropriate. It\u2019s worth noting that a protest is planned for Sunday 6 October and a candlelight vigil is scheduled for Monday 7 October. Josh Lees, a member of the Palestine Action Group Sydney, told ABC RN earlier today that the vigil was \u201cmainly about the chance for Palestinian and Lebanese people to come and grieve for the thousands of people who have died\u201d. More than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, died on 7 October. More than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza, mostly civilians, one in 55 of the prewar population. More than 700 people have died in Lebanon in the recent wave of Israeli attacks. Nedd Brockmann to begin record attempt today Nedd Brockmann, one of the fastest to run across Australia, will begin his attempt at a record today \u2013 hoping to become the fastest time to cover 1,000 miles (1,610km) on foot. The current record stands at 10 days, 10 hours, 30 minutes and 36 seconds, set in 1988. In a May social media post, Brockmann said he was aiming to raise $10m to help Aussies experiencing homelessness, writing: This record has stood since 1988, and for good reason. To break it down, that\u2019s roughly 160 kilometres a day for 10 days in order to break the record \u2026 Yes, 403 laps of the 400m Olympic park track a day. He\u2019s set to begin the run at 4pm, which will be live streamed on TikTok. Brockmann made headlines in 2022 when he ran from Cottesloe to Bondi in 46.5 days, as part of an epic 3,800km charity run. A previous version of this post said Brockmann was the fastest to run across Australia. Chris Turnbull, from Sydney, is the fastest, completing the run in 39 days. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has responded to Peter Dutton\u2019s comments about a pro-Palestine protest planned for the anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel. Dutton argued that Allan has the power to halt the protests. This is despite Victoria police saying they do not have the power to prevent the protest from going ahead, after NSW police launched legal action to prevent the demonstration in Sydney from occurring. Speaking to reporters, Allan said police \u201calready have all the powers they need\u201d to respond to protest activity: Attending a protest on October 7 is not something that is appropriate in any way. I\u2019m not going to cut across operational decisions. Allan said police have the powers to arrest people who may be displaying terrorist flags and are in discussions with the Australian federal police. Anthony Albanese and Allan have urged pro-Palestine protesters not to hold demonstrations on the anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel. Damaging winds forecast for parts of Eyre Peninsula The severe weather warning for damaging winds about South Australia has been updated to include parts of the Eyre Peninsula. The Bureau of Meteorology said damaging winds around 60-70km/h, with peak gusts in over 90km/h, are forecast this morning and afternoon, with the risk easing in the late afternoon. NTEU says restructure plan for ANU \u2018another kick in the guts\u2019 for staff The National Tertiary Education Union has labelled the ANU\u2019s restructure plans \u2013 which includes job cuts \u2013 as \u201canother kick in the guts\u201d for staff. Earlier, we brought you news that the ANU was proposing a restructure amid financial challenges, with \u201cunavoidable\u201d job losses as part of that. NTEU ANU branch president Millan Pintos-Lopez said today\u2019s announcement was \u201ccompletely inconsistent\u201d with recent actions taken in relation to the College of Health and Medicine. Under the proposal, this would be disestablished despite the university spending $16.75m on land for a new health precinct in July 2023. Only three weeks ago, the ANU announced the appointment of Christine Nixon to lead a review of gender equity and culture within the College. Two weeks ago, the Dean, Professor Russell Gruen, stepped down. Staff are right to feel let down by the chaos and confusion. Division secretary Dr Lachlan Clohesy said that communication and consultation has been \u201cpoor throughout\u201d. Staff are sick of these pronouncements from the Chancelry tower, with little to no consultation, which have a huge effect on people\u2019s lives. Pace of rental price growth slowing, as Sydney remains most expensive capital to rent a home The latest PropTrack market insight report, released today, shows the pace of rental price growth is slowing as more available stock comes to market. Median advertised rents rose by 7% over the past year to $610 per week, representing the weakest annual rental price growth since September 2021, the report said. Other key findings include: Capital city advertised rents rose 1.6% to $640 per week over the quarter, while regional rents grew by 1.9% to $540 per week. Capital city rents increased 6.8% over the year, the weakest growth since December 2021, while regional rents rose 8% year-on-year. Annual growth in unit rents (9.1%) remained stronger than annual growth in house rents (6.9%), with the gap narrowing to just $20 per week. Hobart, regional NSW and regional Tasmania were the only markets to see stronger rental growth over the past year compared with the year prior. The report said Sydney remains the most expensive capital city to rent a home, with the median advertised rent unchanged over the quarter and 5.8% higher over the year, taking rents to $730 per week. Melbourne had the cheapest rent out of all the capital cities (median advertised rent of $570) except for Hobart. The report states: Although the pace of rental growth is slowing and more stock is available for rent, supply remains low. However, we anticipate more balanced conditions in the coming months The Australian National University has proposed a reorganisation of its academic structure, with vice-chancellor Professor Genevieve Bell admitting the university is facing \u201ca substantial financial challenge\u201d. The university has proposed a restructure. It said all 42 schools, centres and institutions would be retained, with eight to be moved to different colleges within the university. The number of colleges will be reduced from seven to six, with the College of Health and Medicine to be disestablished. The new College of Science and Medicine will host the university\u2019s science and medicine activities, and three colleges will be renamed to reflect new or expanded areas of focus. Bell said it was \u201c not going to be possible to grow our way out of persistent operating deficits by enrolling more students\u201d. This change proposal has not been taken lightly. We will make all attempts to minimise the impact on our community, however some job losses will be unavoidable. We recognise this is hard, but these are changes we have to make. Without structural intervention, the University will not be financially sustainable. The changes will take effect from 1 January 2025. Peter Dutton claimed that the Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has the ability to stop a pro-Palestine protest from taking place this weekend, ahead of 7 October on Monday. But yesterday, Victorian Police said they have no powers to halt the rally. (See more in yesterday\u2019s blog here). Dutton pointed to the Covid-19 pandemic response when police were deployed, and said the premier should \u201chave the same resolve in relation to this issue\u201d. He said: I think the premier of Victoria had great capacity \u2013 she was part of a government that deployed the police force here in Victoria during the course of Covid to enforce the rule of law, and I think the Victorian Labor party should have the same resolve in relation to this issue, and I\u2019m sure there are laws available and that will be an issue for the premier. Asked if the Coalition would provide military aid to Israel if elected, Peter Dutton said: We provided support to Israel in the past in terms of intelligence sharing, and I don\u2019t think Israel requires the support of Australia in terms of defence material and supplies. But the best thing that we can do at the moment is to provide Israel with that moral support because they\u2019re at threat from an attack from people who don\u2019t share our values. Dutton echoes calls for Australians in Lebanon to leave Peter Dutton echoed calls from the government for Australians in Lebanon to leave \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d It\u2019s been going on for months. It was predictable that we were going to see the circumstance we\u2019re seeing in Lebanon \u2026 But I would just say to people, please, heed the advice of the Smart Traveller website, of the prime minister, of the minister for foreign affairs and exit Lebanon as quickly as you can, and as safely as possible. Dutton said he was happy with news the government has planes in place for Australians to leave. We support the government in the work that they\u2019re doing in that regard. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is speaking to reporters in Melbourne. He was asked about Richard Marles\u2019s call for a 21-day ceasefire in the Middle East, and responded: If he wants to go down the appeasement path of Anthony Albanese that\u2019s an issue for him. Frankly, I think he diminishes himself by being at odds with the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and our partners otherwise. The calls for a 21-day ceasefire were backed by the US and France, as well as the UK, Canada, the European Union, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Masseuse charged with three counts of sexual touching in NSW A masseuse has been charged with sexual touching in central west New South Wales. In June, police began investigating reports a man \u2013 who worked as a masseuse at the time \u2013 had allegedly inappropriately touched a 38-year-old woman during an appointment in Orange. In August police received a second report that a 55-year-old woman had allegedly been inappropriately touched at the same premises. And in September, police received a third report a 34-year-old woman was allegedly inappropriately touched at the premises. Yesterday police arrested a 60-year-old man at Orange police station and charged him with three counts of sexually touching another person without consent. He was granted conditional bail to appear before Orange local court on 24 October. Faruqi calls on media outlets to conduct independent racism reviews The deputy leader of the Greens, Mehreen Faruqi, says all media outlets should conduct anti-racism training and commission independent racism reviews. This follows the release of the Race Reporting Handbook today \u2013 developed by the Australian Human Rights Commission and Media Diversity Australia \u2013 as well as the racism review conducted by the ABC. You can read more about this below: Faruqi said the ABC\u2019s independent review found systemic racism at the national broadcaster, but \u201cthe ABC are not the only ones\u201d. People of colour are dehumanised daily in Australian media, and we\u2019ve seen more and more diverse journalists leave the profession due to their workplaces being unsafe. This has to change, and it has to change now. Faruqi said the handbook was a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d but \u201cthe impetus for change must come from the media outlets.\u201d The consequences of not dealing with the racism in Australian media is the further erosion of audience trust. The International Monetary Fund has just concluded its annual \u201cmission\u201d to examine the state of the Australian economy, and it\u2019s delivered comments that the Albanese government probably won\u2019t be too happy about. Yes, the economy remains \u201cresilient\u201d and GDP growth should start to accelerate. However, the time for cutting official interest rates hasn\u2019t yet arrived: The RBA\u2019s decision to maintain its restrictive policy stance in the near-term is appropriate. A key reason is that underlying inflation is not on a certain path to drop back to within the 2%-3% target range, and governments at all levels aren\u2019t doing as much as they might to help. In doing so, early interest rate cuts are less likely. \u201cThe FY2024/25 Commonwealth budget is projected to deliver a positive fiscal impulse based on the mission\u2019s estimates,\u201d it said, adding that \u201cstate and territory budgets have proven more expansionary than expected in the near-term, incorporating further cost-of-living support and infrastructure spending\u201d. We\u2019ll shortly get a briefing from Lamin Leigh, IMF\u2019s Australia mission chief, who will be asked about these and other conclusions. Treasurer Jim Chalmers, though, said the fund had \u201cendorsed the Albanese Government\u2019s responsible economic management\u201d. He said: The government\u2019s primary focus is to get on top of our inflation challenge without ignoring the risks to growth and the IMF has backed this strategy. A worker is dead and another is seriously injured after a machinery incident at a central Queensland mine, AAP reports. Paramedics were called to the Oaky Creek coalmine at Tieri, west of Rockhampton, following reports of injuries after a machinery incident about 4.30pm yesterday. A man in his 30s suffered significant head injuries and died at the scene, Resources Health and Safety Queensland said. A second man in his 20s suffered life-threatening head, arm and leg injuries and was airlifted to Rockhampton Hospital. Resources Health and Safety Queensland is investigating, with chief executive Rob Djukic stating \u201cour thoughts are with the colleagues, friends and families of both workers.\u201d An RSHQ coal inspector has issued a directive to isolate the incident scene while we investigate. Glencore, the operator of the mine, said the incident occurred when the two employees were carrying out maintenance works. Glencore\u2019s Australian coal arm CEO Ian Cribb said: Our deepest sympathies go out to both workers\u2019 families, friends and colleagues. This is devastating for our entire Oaky Creek workforce, and we are providing support services and counselling. Operations at the mine have been suspended while authorities investigate. Wong questioned on whether changes needed to Australia\u2019s protest laws Penny Wong was questioned on Australia\u2019s laws relating to protest, with a reporter noting that Victoria police said they can\u2019t move people on from protesting as they would not be breaking the law. (See more in yesterday\u2019s blog here). Asked if all states and territories should have uniform laws in place for protests, Wong said: Well, I would hope we wouldn\u2019t need them. I would hope that, you know, we would exercise our rights in this democracy for peaceful protests respectfully and peacefully. I would hope we wouldn\u2019t need to change the law and that\u2019s what I would urge for all Australians. Wong condemns alleged flying of Hezbollah flags at protest The foreign affairs minister said she condemned the alleged flying of Hezbollah flags at a rally last weekend. Wong said: People need to understand what they are saying when they do that \u2013 they are promoting an organisation that is a terrorist organisation. That is not conducive to harmony in Australia, to social inclusion and social cohesion. Penny Wong was also asked how concerned she is about protests planned for 6 and 7 October. She echoed comments from the PM yesterday, and said it is \u201cnot an occasion for protest\u201d. October 7 was the greatest loss of Jewish lives in a single day since the Holocaust. It\u2019s a day of grieving and a day of remembrance and should be honoured as such, and I would hope that Australians would ensure that it can be honoured with respect and solemnity. It is a solemn occasion. It\u2019s not an occasion for protest. The Palestine Action Group says it has planned a candlelight vigil for 7 October in Sydney. A rally is scheduled for Sunday 6 October. Wong says Israel has \u2018right to defend itself\u2019 but urges adherence to international law Taking questions from reporters, Penny Wong was asked how Israel should respond to the missile attack from Iran. She said that \u201cIsrael has a right to defend itself against Iran\u2019s attack\u201d and continued: We continue to condemn Iran\u2019s behaviour in region, its destablisation of the region, its support for many of the actors in the region including Hezbollah. I again make the point that all \u2013 we always urge adherence to international law in all of our statements in relation to the Middle East. Penny Wong also reiterated calls for Australians in Lebanon to leave, and take \u201cwhatever option is available to you\u201d. She said 1,700 Australians and their immediate family are registered with Dfat and have indicated they wish to leave Lebanon. Wong confirmed that 80 seats have been secured on flights that are leaving today, and only 35 of those seats have been taken up. She also said an additional 500 seats have been secured for Australians and their immediate family on two flights to Cyprus, which will be leaving on Saturday. What I would say to Australians who wish to leave \u2013 please take whatever option is available to you. Please do not wait for your preferred route \u2026 If you are able to secure a seat on a flight, please take that seat. If you have a seat on today\u2019s flight, don\u2019t delay. Now is not the time for you to wait and see, now is the time to leave. Penny Wong addressing the media in Geelong The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, is speaking to the media in Geelong in Victoria. Commenting on the escalation of violence in the Middle East, Wong said the strikes by Iran are \u201ca dangerous escalation and we condemn them fully\u201d. It is rightly condemned by all who seek de-escalation and a ceasefire. Under international law, Israel has a right to defend itself against these attacks and as you know Australia always urges adherence to international law \u2026 We have been clear that the cycle of violence cannot continue and we have urged all parties to show restraint and de-escalate. Man shot four times in Sydney\u2019s west as police probe possibility of gang links A man has been shot four times in various parts of his body overnight amid questions about whether there are links to Sydney\u2019s underworld. As AAP reports, the 28-year-old was found with gunshot wounds about 10.50pm last night in Winston Hills, near Parramatta, according to police. He was taken to hospital in a serious but stable condition where he remains under police guard. Specialist forensic police are expected to examine the scene this morning. The circumstances pointed to a targeted shooting but it was too early to tell if it was gang-related, police told AAP. The link to a car fire in nearby Northmead is also being investigated. An SUV was found alight about 11pm and could not be salvaged, despite firefighters\u2019 best efforts. Search for sailor continues after boat washed ashore near Hobart Tasmanian police are continuing their search for a 70-year-old man after an unoccupied boat washed ashore Kingston Beach yesterday. The man has been reported as missing by his family, with indications he boarded the vessel alone in the morning. Acting inspector Peter Borish said a white flybridge cruiser with a small inflatable dingy attached washed onto the beach around 2pm yesterday. Police conducted a \u201csignificant search of the area\u201d yesterday, he said, \u201cand these search efforts will continue today\u201d. Marine resources and the Westpac Rescue Helicopter were used. Information to date indicates the man boarded the vessel alone at the Derwent Park Marina and departed around 7am. The man, aged in his 70s, has now been reported as missing by his family. Anyone with information is urged to contact police. The push by NSW police to stop two pro-Palestine demonstrations from taking place this long-weekend will be heard in the state\u2019s supreme court today. The matter is listed for 2pm. The Palestine Action Group has said on Instagram it will hold a rally outside the court at 1.30pm. For more on the court action, you can read this piece from Mostafa Rachwani below: The first plane has taken off and landed at what will be Australia\u2019s next international airport, AAP reports. A test pilot hit the milestone in a Piper PA-30 Twin Comanche aircraft at Western Sydney International airport after completing a series of landing and take-off runs during daylight, dusk and evening conditions yesterday. The trial comes ahead of the introduction of larger passenger planes which are scheduled to begin using the runway from late 2026. The airport will open with one runway and will be able to cater for up to ten million passengers a year from day one of operations. Weather warnings in WA, SA and NT Let\u2019s take a look at some of the weather warnings across the country today. In Western Australia, a severe weather warning for damaging winds is in place for much of the south coast. Damaging winds around 60-70km/h with peak gusts around 100km/h are likely along the coastal fringe. The system is expected to be windier than typical and unusual for this time of year, the Bureau says. There is also a separate coastal hazard warning for damaging surf conditions. In South Australia, a severe weather warning for damaging winds is in place for western parts of the state today. The risk is expected to ease by the mid to late afternoon. Locations which may be affected include Ceduna, Wudinna, Maralinga, Cook, Nullarbor and Streaky Bay. And in the Northern Territory, a severe heatwave warning remains in place for Daly and the Tiwi Districts. Maximum temperatures in the high thirties to low forties are forecast. Severe heatwave conditions are set to persist until at least early next week in Daly. Josh Lees said rally organisers were asking those attending not to bring Hezbollah flags, because \u201cthey could be deemed illegal, and because we don\u2019t want people to face arrest or legal troubles.\u201d I personally would not fly that flag, I don\u2019t politically agree with Hezbollah, but we defend people\u2019s right to hold pieces of cloth, yes, and I don\u2019t think that the way it\u2019s being talked about is at all reasonable in the media. As I said, there\u2019s no discussion of banning the Israeli flag, whereas that is a state that\u2019s actually carried out far greater acts of terrorism and is right now starting another war on Lebanon, the fourth invasion of Lebanon in Israel\u2019s history. So we should have some perspective [when] we\u2019re talking about Hezbollah and flags, about what\u2019s really going on. For more on this topic, you can read our explainer from Tory Shepherd below: Josh Lees, a member of the Palestine Action Group Sydney, also spoke with ABC RN about the planned pro-Palestine rally in Sydney, scheduled for Sunday. He said the group would be going ahead with the protest \u201cregardless of what happens in the court\u201d. He also said the event planned on Monday 7 October would be \u201ca small candlelight vigil to commemorate those that have been killed over the past year\u201d. It\u2019s mainly about the chance for Palestinian and Lebanese people to come and grieve for the thousands of people who have died, and for their loved ones \u2026 Host Patricia Karvelas asked whether victims of the 7 October Hamas attack would also be recognised at the vigil. Lees said people were welcome to mourn whoever they want: October 7 is also when the genocide in Gaza began. That\u2019s when Israeli leaders proclaimed their intention to go in and level Gaza, to starve it, to bomb it to hell. So this is also the date that marks the beginning of the genocide in Gaza. And you know, I wonder if you are putting the same question to those organising memorials for the Israeli victims of October 7, are you demanding that they mourn the 42,000 dead Palestinians? Marles weighs in on pro-Palestine protest planned in Sydney The deputy prime minister was also asked about comments from the PM yesterday, that 7 October is \u201cnot a time for demonstrations to occur.\u201d Richard Marles said he \u201ccondemn[s] in the strongest possible terms\u201d anyone \u201cseeking to protest in support of terrorist organisations\u201d, including Hezbollah and Hamas. I think it\u2019s also worth observing that October 7 is the anniversary of a tragic and solemn day, a day on which innocent people lost their lives, the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust. It is a moment to commemorate that, and to commemorate that with all the solemnity which is appropriate for that occasion \u2026 There are laws applied that will apply here as well. And the authorities, principally the state authorities who implemented these laws, are clearly acting as we speak. Now, that\u2019s where we\u2019re at at this moment. The Australia Palestine Advocacy Network president, Nasser Mashni, previously said the protests were essential \u201cexpressions of solidarity\u201d for communities in Australia looking to oppose Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza and Lebanon. Marles calls for diplomacy to address growing violence in Middle East Richard Marles continued, clarifying his stance to ABC RN and saying it was \u201ccompletely appropriate\u201d to call for diplomacy: Countries have a right to defend themselves. No one is suggesting anything different to that, and we have been consistent about Israel\u2019s right to defend itself from the outset. The engagement in one\u2019s own defence, it is important that that is done proportionately, and that is because we do not want to see steps taken which give rise to an escalation in this conflict, and that is exactly why we condemn the actions of Iran in firing these missiles. That said, it is really important that we \u2013 as a member of the international community \u2013 are articulating in the strongest possible voice the need for diplomacy to be engaged in to see it into the hostilities. And we\u2019re doing that as well, and that\u2019s that\u2019s completely appropriate. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, is speaking with ABC RN from New Zealand where he is meeting with regional counterparts. Asked about the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East, and whether \u201cceasefire negotiations in Gaza are now dead\u201d, Marles said the \u201ccontinued violence in the Middle East is obviously giving rise to enormous threat to civilian life\u201d. I think the international community is desperate to see an end to this violence, and certainly that\u2019s how we\u2019re exercising our international voice. Marles was asked if he agrees with US president Joe Biden, that the IDF should respond with a proportional response. He responded that Israel has been the subject of attacks from Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas, and \u201cwe condemn those attacks in the strongest possible terms\u201d. He said: Israel has a right to defend itself. Every country has a right to defend itself, and to do so in a proportionate way. That said, we are calling for a ceasefire, along with the United States, along with other members of the international community. The continued violence in the Middle East is giving rise to \u2026 unacceptable numbers of civilian lives lost, and the ongoing violence is a threat to civilian life. And we, along with international community, urge an end to this. Marles said that \u201cthis is the moment for diplomacy\u201d and \u201cwe need to see every effort being made to try and bring about an end to the hostilities in the Middle East, because because of the extraordinary loss of civil in life that we\u2019ve seen as a result of this.\u201d Palestine advocate says planned protests \u2018not provocative\u2019 Nasser Mashni, president of the Australian Palestine Advocacy Network, spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier and was asked about comments from the prime minister yesterday that 7 October was \u201cnot a time for demonstrations to occur\u201d. A pro-Palestine protest is planned for 6 October in Sydney and a vigil planned for 7 October \u2013 but NSW police have applied to the state\u2019s supreme court to attempt to prevent these from going ahead. Mashni said he doesn\u2019t accept a rally would be \u201cprovocative\u201d: We have [been protesting for] 51 weeks in a row, [and it\u2019s been] absolutely peaceful. Millions of Australians have come out, it\u2019s not provocative at all. What\u2019s provocative is the fact that our government isn\u2019t listening to tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of Australians, who have signed petitions, called their MPs, have done everything they\u2019re supposed to do within this democratic framework to say \u2018enough\u2019 \u2026 If my neighbour was beating his dog I can\u2019t keep saying [something]. At some point I\u2019m compelled to jump the fence and grab his hand. Asked about the supreme court decision, Mashni said he has \u201cfaith in our judicial system\u201d. A new report from the Victorian coroners court shows that 547 Victorians died from overdose last year. This is close to the 550 overdose deaths recorded in 2022, which marked the highest annual number recorded in the past decade. Some key findings included in the report include: Men are on average twice as likely as women to die from overdose, and people aged between 35 and 54 are most at risk. Metropolitan Melbourne accounts for approximately three-quarters of overdose deaths. A majority (71.5%) of overdose deaths involved multiple drugs in 2023. The five top contributing drugs to overdose deaths were diazepam (213 deaths), heroin (204 deaths), methamphetamine (164 deaths), alcohol (153 deaths) and pregabalin (78 deaths). From 2014\u201323 the proportion of Victorian overdose deaths involving illegal drugs increased, from 41.3% in 2014 to 59% in 2023. Most overdose deaths are unintentional. In 2023, 395 of the 547 overdose deaths were unintentional, 114 were intentional and in 38 cases intent was unable to be determined based on the evidence available at the time of coding. The Victorian state coroner, John Cain, said the overdose deaths were \u201cpreventable\u201d and that \u201cwe must strengthen our public health response and increase access to supports and treatment\u201d. Drug-related harms are complex and are driven by a variety of factors including changes in drug use, availability and regulation. That is why coronial data is so integral to understanding how best to target resources and save lives. Lifeline: 13 11 14 Alcohol and drug hotline: 1800 250 015 Advocates concerned aged care homes not meeting direct care targets Cota Australia, a leading advocacy group for older people, says it is concerned by new data showing six out of 10 aged care homes are falling short on their mandatory minutes of direct care and registered nurse targets. Data from April to June, released today, shows many aged care homes are failing to meet their direct care targets. Chief executive Patricia Sparrow said increasing the mandatory minutes of care was a key recommendation of the royal commission into aged care, and a \u201csubstantial\u201d piece of reform last year. The fact that too many older people are still not getting the mandated minutes of care is a real concern \u2026 Basic direct care isn\u2019t a \u2018nice to have\u2019, it\u2019s crucial and the absolute minimum we should expect for older Australians in aged care. Care minutes are the amount of direct care people in residential care receive from RN, enrolled nurses and nursing assistants. This month aged care providers are expected to increase their care minutes to an average of 215 minutes per resident, per day, including at least 44 minutes of care provided by a registered nurse. Sparrow said it was especially concerning compliance rates in for-profit aged care homes are significantly lower than those run by not-for-profit providers \u2013 only 23% of for-profit providers met both their RN and total care minutes in the quarter. High fire danger rating for Queensland today In Queensland today, the fire danger rating is sitting at high in most parts of the state. The high fire danger rating means there is a heightened risk of fire, with people urged to stay alert in their area. The fire department said: If you had plans to grind, slash or mow today please reconsider \u2026 If work needs to happen today, be alert and make sure you have water on hand to extinguish any spot fires. And happy Thursday \u2013 many thanks to Martin for kicking things off for us. I\u2019m Emily Wind, and I\u2019ll be taking you through our rolling coverage for most of today. If you have any thoughts, tips or feedback, you can reach out via X, @emilywindwrites, or send me an email: emily.wind@theguardian.com. Let\u2019s go. Impromptu haka leaves Jahrome Hughes with a tear in his eye after Dally M An emotional Jahrome Hughes has admitted he had a tear in his eye after Melbourne teammates launched into a haka to honour his Dally M Medal, AAP reports. In scenes reminiscent of fellow New Zealander Roger Tuivasa-Sheck\u2019s win in 2018, Melbourne winger Will Warbrick took over the Dally Ms to celebrate Hughes\u2019 award. After holding off James Tedesco by one vote and landing the first big individual honour of his career, Hughes watched as Warbrick launched into a haka alongside Storm second-rower Eliesa Katoa and Canberra prop Joseph Tapine. \u201cThat meant a lot,\u201d Hughes said. To see that brought a tear to my eye. For them to do that is truly special. For myself, my culture and family, it just topped off an awesome night. For more on the awards read our full report: Queensland premier Steven Miles and opposition leader David Crisafulli will lock horns in an election debate as Queenslanders prepare to head to the polls, AAP reports. The top-job hopefuls will go head-to-head on the Nine Network at 7.30pm (AEST) in Brisbane tonight before a second debate at the Queensland Media Club 10 days before the election. Both leaders kicked off their campaigns in regional centres where key issues such as cost-of-living, health, housing and crime are pertinent. Polls are pointing to a change of government on 26 October, with the Liberal National party leading 56% to 46% on a two-party preferred basis. The premier and senior ministers announced on day two of the campaign that Labor would establish a state-wide publicly-owned energy retailer if re-elected. The retailer would use existing infrastructure and be up and running within 12 months, the premier said. Crisafulli pledged $30m towards an agriculture innovation fund to attract research opportunities to improve the sector. The Albanese government is looking at cracking down on \u201cdodgy discounts\u201d by supermarkets who reduce product sizes but maintain or increase prices as part of its campaign against misleading and deceptive pricing in the sector. The government will consult on changes to strengthen the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission\u2019s Price Unit Code, which requires larger supermarkets and grocers to provide cost per unit breakdowns on price tags within stores and online. The code means, for example, price tags for laundry detergents are broken down by cost per litre to allow consumers to compare products. Fresh produce price tags must also show price per kilogram or grams. The government announced it would consult on the following changes: Improving readability and visibility of unit pricing in stores, Addressing inconsistent use of units of measure across supermarkets, Whether to expand the scope of retailers covered by the code, More specific prominence and legibility requirements, and Improving the use of unit pricing in cross-retailer price comparisons. The ACCC will also be funded to launch a consumer awareness campaign on how unit pricing can help Australians get better deals. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese said \u201ctackling \u2018shrinkflation\u2019 through stronger unit pricing and new penalties is part of our plan to get a better deal for Australians\u201d. We are also making changes to make sure the ACCC is a tough cop on the beat, while also encouraging more competition and making sure there are significant consequences for supermarkets who do the wrong thing. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I\u2019m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then it\u2019ll be Emily Wind with the main action. Annual rent increases for houses have hit multi-year lows in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide, suggesting a relentless stretch of rising rents may have peaked, a new report has found. Renters are still feeling the pinch from record high prices but the data from Domain revealed the lowest September quarter growth rate since 2019 for houses and 2020 for units. Speaking of cost-of-living issues, the Albanese government is looking to crack down on shrinkflation, the phenomenon where items in your shopping basked get smaller while staying the same price. More on that in a few minutes. Peter Cain, the ACT\u2019s shadow attorney general, has apologised \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d for a 2002 workbook he wrote which paints an ahistorically rosy picture of how Christian settlers helped First Nations peoples. Queensland\u2019s premier, Steven Miles, will promise his state\u2019s households they will always have the cheapest power prices of all mainland states in the national electricity market if Labor is elected this month. He will announce a plan today to use the firm to create an \u201cenergy price guarantee\u201d that Queensland household bills would remain the lowest outside Western Australia. Later he faces off against his LNP rival David Crisafulli in a televised debate."

            "date": "2024-10-08T23:01:04Z",
            "content": "The government\u2019s official climate watchdog has appointed the head of the energy industry\u2019s trade association to lead its work helping to drive the UK\u2019s emissions to net zero by 2050. Emma Pinchbeck, the head of Energy UK, will take up the role of chief executive of the Climate Change Committee (CCC) from early next month after four years at the helm of the trade association. The former deputy of RenewableUK will replace Chris Stark, who was appointed to lead the government\u2019s \u201cmission control centre\u201d on clean energy, a Covid vaccine-style taskforce aimed at delivering clean and cheaper power by 2030. Pinchbeck was tapped for the role earlier this year and told the Guardian in August that \u201cchange can be quite frightening\u201d for rural communities likely to host renewable energy infrastructure. Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, said Pinchbeck would join the CCC at \u201ca pivotal point\u201d in the UK\u2019s journey to net zero, halfway through a \u201cdecisive decade to halt climate change\u201d. \u201cFollowing her leadership at Energy UK, [Pinchbeck] is well placed to advise and challenge government on our net zero goals \u2013 ensuring we meet our climate commitments with ambition and urgency,\u201d Miliband said. He added that Pinchbeck\u2019s \u201cextensive experience\u201d leading the decarbonisation of the energy industry underscores \u201chow the economics of clean energy are now aligned with climate policy, driving both environmental protection and economic growth\u201d. Pinchbeck was appointed Energy UK\u2019s chief executive in January 2020 months before the Covid-19 pandemic led to record low energy market prices that wiped billions from the market value of major energy companies. The sharp bounceback in energy prices in 2021 caused more than 30 energy suppliers to go bust. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 pushed up energy prices across Europe further and forced the UK government to step in to subsidise bills. Pinchbeck said: \u201cEnergy has moved from the fringes to the very centre of economic policy and I hope that I have played my part in making sure that the importance of our sector and of the energy transition is clear to government. \u201cI am excited to bring my experience and knowledge of a decade in energy to the challenge of decarbonising our economy at speed with tangible benefits to the people of the UK.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-05T15:00:28Z",
            "content": "I only recently learned, on a trip to Barcelona, that a large part of the money for Antoni Gaud\u00ed\u2019s glorious buildings came from slavery in Cuba, in which Catalan traders were engaged as late as the 1880s. His greatest patron, Eusebi G\u00fcell, owed much of his wealth to slave-based fortunes accumulated by his father-in-law and his father \u2013 a fact that, while not secret, is little explored in the official histories. Does this mean that the great architect\u2019s work is fatally tainted, that the tourists who queue up to visit the Gaud\u00ed-designed palace, park and unfinished church that bear G\u00fcell\u2019s name should feel bad about themselves for doing so? It does not. But it\u2019s never wrong to know the truth, however difficult. There\u2019s a particular lesson for anyone who might want to emulate Gaud\u00ed now. Works like his come not only from singular genius but also from surplus capital of often dark origins. To adapt Balzac almost beyond recognition, behind many great buildings lies a great crime. Vanity projects I\u2019ll leave it to film critics to capture the full boggling wonder of Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s late-career $120m imperial-themed bin-fire Megalopolis. I\u2019ll only observe how uncannily its main protagonist, an architect called Cesar Catilina, captures the grandiose, self-regarding, would-be profundity of certain members of his profession. Dressed in priestly black and chauffeured to and from his Chrysler Building penthouse in a black vintage Citro\u00ebn DS, this is a man who confuses his facility for generating ectoplasmic digital doodles with the power to save the world. He has people\u2019s homes blown up because they get in the way of his vision, all the while delivering messages as if from cod-Shakespearean fortune cookies. \u201cA human being shall rightly be called a great miracle.\u201d \u201cOur mother earth gave us the genius to see a future so beautiful that it cannot be denied.\u201d The character, played by Adam Driver, is perfection, genius, a portrayal of hilarious architectural vanity to match Gary Cooper in The Fountainhead and Woody Harrelson in Indecent Proposal. I have met real-live well-known architects who are as ridiculous as this. The only thing is, I think Catilina is meant to be the movie\u2019s hero. No great ad for Britain It\u2019s a great triumph that the country that invented the industrial revolution has just closed its last coal-fired power station, at Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire. The mighty cooling towers of this and similar facilities were also great triumphs, from an era that hadn\u2019t heard of climate change. They inspire affection from many who live near them. It would be mad to keep all these structures, but it would also be mad to wipe all trace of them from the land. If you wanted to condense into one space, with the help of giant alembics and Bunsen burners, all the ills of the private-public interface in contemporary Britain, it would be hard to beat Euston station in London. Here is an essential piece of infrastructure, blighted by off-again, on-again plans for the HS2 high-speed rail line, which may or may not end up there. About \u00a3300m has been spent on fees for redesigns that may never happen, while the neighbourhood has been devastated in the interests of development and the station\u2019s quietly noble modernist concourse has been butchered, its wall panels replaced with cheap-looking plywood. Passengers, awaiting the teasingly late announcements of their platform in the usually overcrowded space, were bludgeoned with huge animated advertisements, until they were terminated by ministerial decree last Friday. Anything to do with extracting value is exploited to the limit. Anything to do with practicality, joy, human life or basic comfort is, over and over, botched. \u2022 Rowan Moore is the Observer\u2019s architecture critic Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "date": "2024-10-02T08:00:34Z",
            "content": "There was a strange feeling as the vice-presidential debate got under way in the CBS News studios on Tuesday night that only intensified as 90 minutes of detailed policy discussion unfolded: was the United States in danger of regaining its sanity? After weeks and months of being assailed by Donald Trump\u2019s dystopian evocation of a country on the verge of self-destruction, amplified by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris\u2019s dire warnings of democracy in peril, here was something very different. The two vice-presidential nominees were embracing that most endangered of American political species: agreement. \u201cTim, I actually think I agree with you,\u201d said JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, addressing his opposite number Tim Walz during the discussion on immigration. \u201cMuch of what the senator said right there, I\u2019m in agreement with him,\u201d said Walz, the Minnesota governor and Democratic nominee, as they turned to trade policy. It wasn\u2019t true, of course. The two men were no closer to agreement than their bosses, who in their own presidential debate last month showed themselves to be worlds apart. But on Tuesday it was as if the CBS News studio in midtown Manhattan had been transported back to a prelapsarian \u2013 or at least, pre-Maga \u2013 times. To an era when politicians could be civil, and to get on you didn\u2019t have to castigate your opponent as an enemy of the people. For Vance the metamorphosis was especially striking. He is, after all, running mate to the architect of \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d. For his own part, the senator from Ohio has spread malicious untruths about legally resident Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, eating people\u2019s cats and dogs. Not to mention that he\u2019s the \u201cchildless cat-ladies\u201d guy. An unrecognisable Vance emerged on the New York stage. This one listened respectfully to his debating partner, spoke in whole and largely measured sentences, and went so far as to admit his own fallibility \u2013 three qualities that the former president rarely emulates. Vance had reason to present himself differently from Trump, perhaps. At 40, to Trump\u2019s 78, he has the future to think about \u2013 his own future. But his affable demeanor was also artifice. When it came to the content of what he said, the Republican vice-presidential nominee was as economical with the truth as his overseer. He lied with abandon, in fact. He just did it with a silken tongue. He talked about the vice-president presiding over an \u201copen border\u201d with Mexico when numbers of border-crossers are actually at a four-year low. He claimed he had not supported a national abortion ban \u2013 oh yes he did, repeatedly during his 2022 senatorial race. On the Middle East crisis, he accused the \u201cKamala Harris administration\u201d of handing Iran $100bn in the form of unfrozen assets \u2013 not true. It was $55bn, and it was negotiated under Barack Obama. Perhaps most egregiously, he said Trump had \u201csalvaged\u201d the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Obama\u2019s wildly popular healthcare insurance scheme commonly known as Obamacare. \u201cSalvaged\u201d was an interesting choice of word to apply to Trump, who tried 60 times to destroy the ACA without offering any alternative. Yet it would have taken an attentive viewer to see behind Vance\u2019s smooth comportment to the lies he was purveying. The former tech investor and bestselling author of Hillbilly Elegy looked comfortable on stage and in his own skin, presenting himself as the reasonable Trump, a Maga lion in sheep\u2019s clothing. Walz by contrast had moments in which he came across as tense and uneasy, the pre-debate nerves that had been reported by CNN appearing to have been genuine. While Vance beamed his piercingly blue eyes direct to camera, the Minnesota governor frequently looked down at his notes. The folksy, aw-shucks \u201cCoach Walz\u201d who has taken the US by storm since he was plucked out of Minnesota obscurity to be Harris\u2019s running mate was largely absent. He stumbled on occasion, garbling his words to refer to having become \u201cfriends\u201d with school shooters rather than their victims\u2019 families. And he mishandled a question about why he had wrongly claimed to have visited China during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, woodenly trying to dodge the issue by calling himself a \u201cknucklehead\u201d. But when push came to shove, Walz came through. On the subjects that matter most to Harris in her bid to become the first female president, and the first woman of color in the Oval Office, he hit Vance hard \u2013 civilly, but hard. On abortion he followed his running mate\u2019s lead and spoke movingly about the personal impact of Trump\u2019s effective evisceration of Roe v Wade. He invoked the story of Amber Thurman, who died as she traveled in search of reproductive care from Georgia to North Carolina. That even extracted one of the most surprising \u201cI agree\u201d remarks of the evening from the staunchly anti-abortion Vance: \u201cGovernor, I agree with you, Amber Thurman should still be alive \u2026 and I certainly wish that she was.\u201d There was only one point in the evening when the kid gloves came off, and the cod display of gentility was discarded by both parties. It came when Vance had the audacity to claim \u2013 silkenly, naturally \u2013 that Harris\u2019s attempts to \u201ccensor\u201d misinformation in public discourse posed a far greater threat to democracy than Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election on January 6. \u201cTim, I\u2019m focused on the future,\u201d Vance deflected when Walz asked him directly whether Trump had lost that contest. \u201cThat is a damning non-answer,\u201d the Democrat shot back, his face pained. In the last analysis, both men were only there playing the role of sidekick. They may have raised hopes that civility could make a comeback to US politics, but let Trump have the last word. \u201cWalz was a Low IQ Disaster - Very much like Kamala,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social site shortly after the debate had ended. And just like that, it was business as usual."

            "date": "2024-10-17T17:33:11Z",
            "content": "The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is exploring ways to raise billions of pounds extra in taxes at the budget. Labour outlined about \u00a39bn worth of tax-raising measures in its manifesto, but also committed not to increase taxes on \u201cworking people\u201d using the three biggest revenue-raisers for the Treasury: income tax, national insurance and VAT. The party also committed to not increasing corporation tax on businesses. However, Reeves has said she was keen to avoid a \u201creturn to austerity\u201d under the new government, and told cabinet colleagues that meeting this pledge could force her to raise more in taxes than originally planned. The chancellor has warned that a \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d in the public finances \u2013 which Labour claims it inherited from the Conservatives \u2013 will persist over the next five years, forcing the new government to take \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d on spending, welfare and tax. Reeves is aiming to make \u00a340bn worth of tax rises and spending cuts a year to overcome the shortfall, in order to meet her \u201cgolden rule\u201d of balancing day-to-day spending with tax receipts. This would help to avoid a fresh round of cuts to departmental budgets. Here are the tax raising options under consideration: Capital gains tax Reeves has been exploring a rise in capital gains tax (CGT) since before the general election, as revealed by the Guardian. About \u00a315bn a year is raised, paid by about 350,000 people each year \u2013 and the majority coming from a small subset of super-rich individuals. CGT is levied on the increase in the value of an asset in the period between its purchase and disposal. Various rates apply on the sale of different assets, including residential property, shares and carried interest earned by private equity fund managers. At present, the top rate of income tax is 45%, but most types of capital gain are taxed at 20% and can be as low as 10%. The chancellor could raise up to \u00a314bn by bringing the rates into line with income tax bands, but she could opt for a narrower set of changes to raise about \u00a38bn. Non-dom tax reforms Labour\u2019s manifesto included measures to raise \u00a35.2bn in extra revenue from closing further loopholes in the non-dom tax regime, building on changes made by Jeremy Hunt in the March 2024 budget. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that scrapping the tax break for wealthy foreigners could raise about \u00a33.2bn a year, but warned this was a \u201chighly uncertain\u201d figure as the super-rich could either leave Britain or find ways to avoid the tax. It emerged last month that Treasury officials feared Labour\u2019s additional measures could end up losing the exchequer \u00a31bn, rather than bringing in more money. It is thought the chancellor is reconsidering her plans. Inheritance tax About \u00a38bn a year is raised by inheritance tax, with the levy typically paid on the estates of about 5% of annual deaths \u2013 the wealthiest estates in Britain. The chancellor could close several loopholes. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has suggested bringing pension pots into scope, and ending business and agricultural reliefs, to raise up to \u00a32bn. Reeves could go further by ending the complicated residence nil-band rate, introduced in 2017, which provides an extra tax-free allowance if a main residence is left to a direct descendent. This could raise a further \u00a32bn. Employer national insurance contributions There are two options for the chancellor. First, levying employer national insurance contributions (NICs) on pensions contributions. The Resolution Foundation estimates this could raise \u00a318bn, but because it would also hit public-sector employers, they would need to be reimbursed \u2013 reducing the net gain to about \u00a312bn. The second would be a straightforward increase in the rate of NICs paid by employers. Employers pay NICs for most workers earning more than \u00a39,100 a year, paying the equivalent of 13.8% on earnings above the threshold. HM Revenue and Customs estimates a one percentage point increase in the rate would bring in almost \u00a39bn by 2027-28. The chancellor has strongly hinted she could do this. However, she has faced criticism that this could break Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge, with warnings workers would ultimately pay the price through lower wages. Reeves could, though, argue that businesses, not \u201cworking people\u201d, would shoulder the cost. \u2018Sin\u2019 taxes Ministers are understood to be considering a tax increase of up to \u00a33bn on the gambling sector, after a report by the centre-left IPPR thinktank suggested the move in September among key recommendations for tackling Britain\u2019s health challenges. Fuel duty Successive Conservative chancellors have frozen fuel duty since 2011, handing a generous tax break to motorists, while depriving the exchequer of a total of about \u00a3100bn in foregone revenue. Rishi Sunak also launched a temporary 5p fuel duty cut in 2022 to address the cost of living crisis, which has been extended twice and is due to expire in March next year. The default government position is that the temporary cut ends and fuel duty will rise in line with retail price inflation next spring. For this reason, allowing a rise wouldn\u2019t help to plug the chancellor\u2019s forecast budget deficit \u2013 because the OBR already assumes the tax rate will go back up automatically. Reeves is under heavy pressure to freeze the rate from motoring groups. But doing so would come at a serious cost. Cancelling the scheduled rises would be worth \u00a34.8bn, according to the Resolution Foundation. What Reeves won\u2019t do Although Labour has complained of a dire economic inheritance from the Conservatives, there is one measure in particular Reeves will be quietly thankful for. Her legacy included planning tax rises between 2025 and 2027 that add up to \u00a324bn a year through the freezing of income tax and national insurance thresholds. Known as \u201cfiscal drag\u201d, the thresholds would normally increase in line with inflation in-year. Because they don\u2019t, there is a windfall for the exchequer. Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge not to increase income tax, national insurance and VAT makes it politically challenging for the chancellor to touch the three biggest revenue-raising taxes for the exchequer. The previous government\u2019s 4p cut in national insurance cost the exchequer about \u00a320bn, which Labour has not said it would reverse. Increasing income tax by 1p would raise almost \u00a37.5bn on the basic rate in 2027-28, while for the higher and additional rates it would raise \u00a32bn and \u00a3210m."

            "date": "2024-10-18T09:00:19Z",
            "content": "As the budget approaches, expect more balderdash and hogwash from Labour\u2019s enemies and their foghorn media. Listen to them protest that raising employers\u2019 national insurance would betray the manifesto, making Labour\u2019s pre-election pledge not to put up taxes on working people a blatant lie. But was it? Labour never said where new taxes would fall, only where they wouldn\u2019t. The manifesto said: \u201cLabour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase national insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, or VAT.\u201d There are two types of class 1 national insurance \u2013 one paid by employees and the other by their employers. Labour\u2019s rumoured plans are only for the latter. Most would assume \u201cworking people\u201d are not the same as bosses; employees not the same as employers. Two mighty arbiters of all things economic have taken opposite views. The Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 director, Paul Johnson, told Times Radio: \u201cIt seems to me that [raising employers\u2019 national insurance] would be a straightforward breach of a manifesto commitment\u201d, because the pledge not to raise national insurance \u201cdoesn\u2019t specify employee national insurance\u201d. IFS research suggests that employers tend to pass on the costs to their workers in the form of lower wages. But the Resolution Foundation\u2019s interim chief executive, Mike Brewer, says: \u201cThe fact is, levying employer national insurance on pension contributions, or even raising employer national insurance rates, do not break the letter of the manifesto. Far more importantly, the government has a \u00a340bn hole to fill in terms of preventing further austerity while sticking to its fiscal rules. We should be discussing which would be the least bad tax rises to fill that hole, not the semantics of the language used in party manifestos.\u201d Parties don\u2019t boast of new taxes before an election, while new governments (except Liz Truss\u2019s) do raise tax in their first budgets. Voters this year said they expected tax rises whoever won, but that\u2019s no guarantee they would have voted for a party that was promising them. Politicians can be economical with the truth, but voters can also be fickle and contrary, wanting public spending but reluctant to pay the price. However, in recent years, plenty of polls have showed voters more willing to pay more tax: 52% told a British Social Attitudes survey they favoured higher taxes, while the Financial Fairness Tracker found that more than half wanted spending increases in public services, even if it meant personally paying more tax. It is high time for Labour to reframe tax, describing it not as a \u201cburden\u201d but the price for recovery from austerity \u2013 and the price we pay for civilisation. But after 14 years in the political wilderness, there was no risk-taking with that famous Ming vase. What if Labour had not voluntarily put on such a straitjacket on the three main taxes? That\u2019s a \u201cwhat if\u201d that will never be resolved. The clamour of bogus indignation from the Tories and the Tory press conveniently forgets that during the election campaign, they themselves pointed out Labour\u2019s strategic silence on whether employers\u2019 national insurance might be raised. Laura Trott, the then chief secretary to the Treasury, produced the party\u2019s 12 June document, titled Labour\u2019s 18 Tax Rises, which pointed out: \u201cLabour define \u2018no tax rises for working people\u2019 as only ruling out raising employee national insurance, income tax and VAT, not other taxes.\u201d But now the same Laura Trott claims: \u201c[It\u2019s] obvious to all, that hiking employer national insurance is a clear break of Labour\u2019s manifesto.\u201d Both can\u2019t be true. But that\u2019s flimflam, compared with what the Tories actually did in the run-up to the election. Few governments offer quite such crude tax bribes as Jeremy Hunt\u2019s 4p cut to national insurance, which was not only unaffordable, but done on the never-never, not saying what spending cuts would pay for it. The IFS\u2019s Paul Johnson, writing back then, said: \u201cActually implementing his plans would require cutting unprotected services \u2013 including councils, courts, further education colleges and prisons.\u201d Nor did that attempted tax bribe shift the electoral dial: years of grinding down public services spurred that great electoral surge to be rid of the Conservatives. It was good to see Mervyn King, the former Bank of England governor, calling the Tory cut to national insurance \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d in an article for the Independent, and urging a Labour U-turn to reverse it. National insurance is an anomaly: a lower rate is taken for earnings above a certain threshold, when equalising the rates on higher earnings with those paid by lower earners would bring in \u00a320bn, and levying it on all forms of income, including dividends and earnings from employment by people over the state pension age, would raise a further \u00a312bn, according to Warwick University. (When I reached pension age, my payslip suddenly had no national insurance deducted. Why?) Labour has renounced a rise for workers, but could widen national insurance\u2019s scope to unearned income. Plentiful fruit ripe for the plucking includes this on Thursday from Prof Arun Advani of CenTax: business and agricultural tax reliefs are among the loopholes that let a quarter of eligible estates worth over \u00a310m pay less than 9% in inheritance tax, while one in six pay less than 4%. It\u2019s an extraordinary disparity, a loss to the Treasury debated on Thursday in parliament\u2019s Westminster Hall. It\u2019s time that business lobbies protesting over any increase in their taxes faced a resoundingly robust challenge. The Confederation of British Industry told the BBC that raising employers\u2019 national insurance would make it \u201charder for businesses to create the jobs and the growth\u201d to fund public services. But if they do worry about public services, what would they do? National insurance on employer pension contributions could raise as much as \u00a317bn a year, and adding 1p to employer national insurance would bring in \u00a38.5bn. No serious interviewer should ever let business lobbyists, or opposition politicians, decry any tax rise that emerges in the budget without saying what they would raise instead, or exactly what services they would cut. And there should be no fudging with \u201cefficiency savings\u201d or the magic of AI. Honesty about taxes deserves at least that. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"

            "date": "2024-10-29T17:00:13Z",
            "content": "The economy looms large over next month\u2019s presidential election as tens of millions of Americans begin casting their votes. Employers are hiring and inflation is fading but consumers are still counting the cost of years of soaring prices. Polls show voters of all persuasions remain unhappy about the state of the economy. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have laid out plans they say will transform the world\u2019s largest economy \u2013 and tackle voters\u2019 concerns. Come 5 November, those plans are likely to have played a large part in who will win the White House. So where do the two candidates stand on the key economic issues? Taxes The US-vice president has pledged to expand the child tax credit, including a $6,000 credit for new parents. She has also pledged expanding earned income tax credit for lower-income workers who are not raising children at home. While Harris has promised that no one earning less than $400,000 would pay \u201ca penny\u201d more in taxes under her plan, for Americans earning over $1m a year, the tax rate on long-term capital gains would increase from 20% to 28%. Tax cuts introduced under Trump in 2017 are due to expire at the end of next year. He has pledged to \u201cmake permanent\u201d some of the measures in the legislation, including a higher standard deduction for taxpayers and a child tax credit boost. Both candidates have pledged to end taxes on tips. Trump has also signaled his support for eliminating taxes on overtime pay, and argued that seniors should not pay tax on social security benefits. The Tax Foundation estimates Trump\u2019s proposals will add $3tn to the 10-year budget deficit. The thinktank estimates that the net effect of Harris\u2019s policies would increase deficits by $2.3tn over the next decade. Cost of living Harris has pledged to call on Congress to introduce a federal ban on price gouging. Her administration would also crack down on \u201cunfair\u201d corporate mergers and takeovers that consolidate power within the food industry. Trump, meanwhile, has pledged to end \u201cmarket-distorting\u201d restrictions on oil, natural gas and coal \u2013 a move his campaign has claimed would lower fuel and energy prices by boosting production. The proposal has prompted widespread criticism from climate experts and campaigners. Both candidates have pledged to reduce healthcare costs. Harris has proposed making permanent tax credit enhancements under the Affordable Care Act, and extending a $35 cap on insulin. Trump has promised wider access to affordable healthcare and prescription drugs, without providing much detail. Business Under Harris, the federal corporate tax rate would rise from 21% to 28% \u2013 part of a strategy she says would make firms \u201cpay their fair share\u201d. An excise tax on stock buybacks by publicly traded corporations, currently set at 1%, would be quadrupled. Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts During Trump\u2019s first term, the corporate tax rate was cut from 35% to 21%. Now he wants to reduce it further, to 15% for companies that manufacture their products in the US, in a bid to boost America\u2019s industrial heartlands. Harris has also pledged to expand the start-up expense tax deduction from $5,000 to $50,000 and has set a target of 25m new business applications in four years. Trump promised to end an \u201cunAmerican\u201d crackdown on cryptocurrencies, repeal artificial intelligence regulations brought in under Joe Biden, and \u201ccreate a robust Manufacturing Industry in Near Earth Orbit\u201d in a bid to encourage innovation. Trade \u201cTariffs\u201d is the \u201cmost beautiful word in the dictionary\u201d, Trump has said on the campaign trail. A baseline levy of 10% on all foreign imports is at the heart of the former president\u2019s plan to reduce the US trade deficit. While he has pledged to bring down prices, economists say this risks increasing them. Trump is also threatening to impose higher tariffs on China, and has pledged to ban companies that outsource jobs overseas from doing business with the federal government. Harris has pledged to stand up for American businesses that are \u201cthreatened\u201d by unfair trade practices, citing areas including shipbuilding, electric vehicles and intellectual property. While Trump has made clear he plans to shake up the global economic system, Harris \u201cbelieves in upholding and strengthening international economic rules and norms that protect fair trade and create predictability and stability\u201d, according to a policy book released by her campaign. Labor Harris pledged to sign \u201clandmark pro-union legislation\u201d including the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which is designed to protect workers\u2019 rights to form unions, and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, which would expand collective bargaining rights to all public sector workers. A Harris administration would also \u201cfight to raise the minimum wage\u201d and \u201cend the sub-minimum wage\u201d for tipped workers and people with disabilities, according to her campaign. Both campaigns have promised to spur job creation. Trump has pledged to do this by cutting regulations, although his policy platform did not provide details of which would be cut. The former president has outlined plans for the \u201clargest deportation program in American history\u201d, claiming that immigrants are \u201ctaking your jobs\u201d. Economists say that immigration has boosted the US economy, and warn that deporting millions of migrant workers \u2013 as Trump has outlined \u2013 would hit it hard. Housing The soaring cost of housing is a major campaign issue. While Trump has pledged to \u201creduce mortgage rates by slashing inflation\u201d to help Americans buy homes, he has been warned that some of his policies, such as tariffs, would stoke inflation. He has also suggested he would try to influence the Federal Reserve, the central bank responsible for setting interest rates, raising questions about its independence. The former president has vowed to open up \u201climited portions\u201d of federal land for homebuilding and provide unspecified tax incentives and support to first-time buyers. Harris, meanwhile, has pledged to provide first-time buyers with $25,000 in down-payment assistance, and introduce a \u201csignificant\u201d tax cut for homebuilders who construct properties sold to \u201cworking families\u201d. She has also committed to expand low-income housing tax credits for private and non-profit developers to build affordable rental housing, and create a neighborhood homes tax credit to support the new construction or rehabilitation of more than 400,000 owner-occupied homes in lower-income communities."

After Labour\u2019s landslide election victory in July, Reeves published Treasury analysis revealing a \u00a322bn overspend in the current financial year, which she claimed had been \u201ccovered up\u201d and left unaccounted for by the Conservatives. In analysis angrily disputed by the Tories, this included a soaring bill to deal with asylum claims and illegal immigration, as well as spending on the NHS, the Ukraine crisis, and maintaining roads and railways. However, almost half the shortfall was related to Labour\u2019s decision to agree to above-inflation public sector pay deals. But in a partial vindication for the government, the Resolution Foundation said the \u201cbroad scale\u201d of the spending pressures left by the Conservatives was already being confirmed by official monthly snapshots of the public finances published by the Office for National Statistics. Sounding the alarm over a \u201ctruly dire\u201d outlook for the public finances, it said the chancellor would still need to take tough decisions in the budget on 30 October even if she relaxed a self-imposed debt rule to enable higher spending on infrastructure projects. It is understood Reeves is focused on sticking tightly to a second fiscal rule that requires day-to-day spending to be matched by tax receipts, underpinning Labour\u2019s warnings that \u201cpainful\u201d tax, spending and welfare changes will be made. In the runup to the election, Labour outlined plans for \u00a39bn of tax rises. However, the Resolution Foundation said this figure would need to be increased to about \u00a320bn to maintain spending to meet Keir Starmer\u2019s promise to bring an \u201cend to austerity\u201d. Earlier this week, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said as much as \u00a325bn would be required, while warning that Labour had limited its options by promising before the general election not to increase income tax, national insurance or VAT. The Guardian revealed on Thursday that the Treasury was scrambling to look elsewhere to raise funds, but that its plans were at risk of unravelling amid questions over the impact that large changes to certain wealth taxes would have. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said the strain on the government finances \u2013 from court backlogs and overcrowded prisons to rundown local services \u2013 meant that spending increases worth \u00a320bn would be needed to reverse austerity. \u201cTax rises on that scale would doubtless make for hostile headlines but are actually par for the course at post-election budgets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe short-term reaction to such an approach may be concern about tax rises and extra borrowing, but the long-term prize of restored public services, new infrastructure and stronger growth is what Britain needs to deliver long-needed rises in living standards.\u201d A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cWe have been clear that there will be no return to austerity, which is why we are focused on making this the most pro-growth Treasury in history, built on the rock of economic stability, including robust fiscal rules. \u201cDespite uncovering a \u00a322bn black hole in our public finances we are committed to our manifesto pledge to protect working people, which means no changes to their national insurance, basic, higher and additional rates of income tax or VAT.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-28T06:00:23Z",
            "content": "Pubs and restaurants are warning of closures and a tough Christmas ahead if Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget this week raises taxes and ends a Covid-era relief on business rates. Reeves is expected to reveal a tax-raising budget on Wednesday, to pay for improved public services, with Labour sources indicating the government is intending to raise taxes and cut spending by a combined \u00a340bn. Businesses across the economy are bracing for higher taxes, which could dent consumer spending. However, hospitality businesses are particularly worried because of the scheduled end next spring of the business rates relief, which could mean the tax bills charged on their properties will quadruple. Rates relief was introduced in 2020 for pubs, restaurants, bars and cafes when the government ordered all hospitality to close during the Covid-19 pandemic. Reeves\u2019s Conservative predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, last extended the business rates relief in November. The relief offers a 75% discount, capped at \u00a3110,000, until 1 April. The British Beer and Pub Association, the British Institute of Innkeeping and UKHospitality issued a joint call on Monday for Reeves to effectively make the relief permanent for hospitality businesses. The lobby groups said a new survey by NielsenIQ showed that 54% of the companies surveyed said they would reduce their employment levels, and 51% said they would cancel planned investment, if full business rates were reintroduced. More than a quarter of the businesses surveyed said they would close at least one site if their rates bills returned to pre-pandemic levels. In a joint statement, the lobby groups said: \u201cMany cash-strapped pubs, brewers, bars, restaurants and cafes, to name a few, would simply be unable to survive their rates bills quadrupling. \u201cNot only does inaction risk half of businesses having to cut jobs and cancel investment, but it also means a quarter would have to consider closing at least one site, which might be their entire business.\u201d A higher business rates bill could come with consumer spending still struggling. UK consumer confidence fell this month, according to the long-running GfK consumer confidence survey. Some analysts have warned of a \u201cvibecession\u201d that could mean spending falls even as the economy holds up relatively well. Tax-raising measures on consumers are expected to include a \u201cstealth\u201d freeze on income tax thresholds that would raise revenues while leaving headline rates the same. Some economists also believe that employers could limit pay rises in response to widely expected higher employer national insurance contributions. The accountancy firm RSM UK said 42% of UK consumers will spend less on Christmas this year if tax rises affect incomes in the budget, according to a survey of 2,000 people. Saxon Moseley, partner and head of leisure and hospitality at RSM UK, said: \u201cDespite real wages increasing, if tax changes impact consumer confidence then the hospitality industry may well see a spending hit over the all-important festive period.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-10T14:00:13Z",
            "content": "Rachel Reeves is considering raising capital gains tax as high as 39% in the budget, the Guardian can reveal, amid a scramble to raise funds for crumbling public services. Treasury modelling being reviewed by the chancellor and seen by this newspaper shows officials are testing a range of 33% to 39% for capital gains tax (CGT). The wealth tax is paid by about 350,000 people and is levied on the sale of assets including second homes and shares but at significantly lower rates than wages. Whitehall sources say there is growing concern about the limited options for tax rises to fill a hole the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) thinktank says is as big as \u00a325bn, ahead of the budget on 30 October. \u201cSome very big tax decisions are being left until very late in the day,\u201d one senior source claimed. Another said the Treasury\u2019s tax-raising plans were in \u201ccomplete disarray\u201d. Reeves and Keir Starmer have repeatedly pledged not to raise taxes for \u201cworking people\u201d, ruling out increases in income tax and national insurance. But with plans for other wealth taxes in tatters, Whitehall officials and ministers are concerned that time is running out to find ways to raise money. Officials have already warned Reeves that plans to target non-doms and private equity bosses may not raise any money, or could even cost the exchequer revenue, as wealthy individuals flee the UK. A Treasury spokesperson denied suggestions of \u201cdisarray\u201d. \u201cThese claims are inaccurate,\u201d they said, adding that they did not comment on \u201cpure speculation\u201d regarding specific tax measures before a budget. Sources said plans for big increases in CGT and inheritance tax (IHT) were also at risk of unravelling, as officials raced to present fresh modelling to the government\u2019s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), in time for it to check Treasury figures. Recent Treasury modelling shows Reeves is considering raising higher rates of CGT and has asked the OBR to assess how much money could be generated from a range of between 33% and 39% levied on second homes, for example. Under the current system, profits from the sale of second homes at up to 24% or shares in businesses, up to 20%, are taxed at a much lower rate than wages, which are taxed at up to 45%. The move would not go as far as CGT rates mirroring those of income tax, as some Labour MPs have called for. Internal documents laying out the modelling note that it is hard to predict how people will respond to higher taxes on capital gains, and present an array of scenarios for different levels. Only about 350,000 people a year pay CGT, but they contribute about \u00a315bn per annum in tax receipts, according to IFS figures. At the lowest end of a possible increase \u2013 if 28% were to move to 33% for instance \u2013 a few hundred million pounds could be raised for the exchequer, the modelling suggests. Increasing CGT to the middle of the range across different classes of assets could raise about \u00a31bn, it shows. In the more extreme scenario, such as hiking it to 39%, then the annual amount raised by CGT could actually fall after five years. Many of the findings of the Treasury modelling echo research produced by HM Revenue and Customs in June. At present, top rate taxpayers must pay 24% on gains from residential property that is not their main home, 28% on gains from \u201ccarried interest\u201d if they manage an investment fund, and 20% on gains from some other assets, according to government guidance. Rates for lower rate taxpayers are less. Wealth managers have reported a flurry of investors rushing to sell second homes and other assets before the budget, after the Guardian revealed in June that the chancellor was considering raising CGT rates. This is likely to lead to a temporary bulge in tax receipts. Reeves\u2019s tax-raising plans have come under increasing attack, with Starmer on Wednesday repeatedly refusing to say whether Labour plans to levy national insurance on employers\u2019 pension contributions. The IFS suggested doing so could raise about \u00a317bn a year. But bosses have warned of \u201cunintended consequences\u201d from such a move, warning it would hike their wage bills and put companies off topping up staff pension pots. Economists are concerned that raising the rate of CGT without a wider overhaul of its complex structure could fail to have the desired revenue-raising effect in the long term. \u201cThe government should seek to make [CGT] reform credibly lasting. It should set out clear principles and a rationale for reform and commit to the new regime for the length of the parliament. Instability and unpredictability are bad for investment,\u201d the IFS said in a tax policy paper released last week. The Guardian understands that the chancellor has ruled out adopting any tax measures that would leave the country worse off in her budget. The Treasury was given multiple opportunities to comment on detailed points regarding the internal modelling well ahead of publication but did not dispute them. However, after publication it changed its position to say: \u201cThis reporting is not based on government modelling \u2013 we do not recognise it. This is pure speculation.\u201d"

            "content": "Rachel Reeves will not change the rate of capital gains tax on the sale of second homes in the budget amid concerns about the impact on the property market. Ministers have decided to leave CGT levied on the sale of second homes and buy-to-let properties untouched because of concerns that increasing it would cost money, the Times reported. In the last budget, the Conservatives cut the top rate of CGT for property from 28% to 24%. The Office for Budget Responsibility said at the time the cut would raise nearly \u00a3700m by increasing the number of property sales and resulting income from stamp duty. Now ministers are concerned that putting up the rate again would cost the Treasury money by slowing property sales, the Guardian understands. Keir Starmer has indicated that CGT on the sale of shares and other assets, currently set at up to 20%, will increase in the budget on 30 October. The tax is expected to rise by several percentage points. Only about 350,000 people a year pay the tax, but they contribute about \u00a315bn in tax receipts, according to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said that interviews it had carried out with millionaires suggested most would not be put off investing by a rise in CGT. One, Julia Davies, told the IPPR she had \u201cnever let tax rates dictate my decisions to fund innovation or pursue opportunities\u201d, while the Photobox co-founder Graham Hobson, said the claim that increasing CGT would discourage investment was \u201csimply a myth\u201d. \u201cCapital gains tax was equal to income tax when I set up Photobox. It didn\u2019t stop me from starting and growing a successful business,\u201d Hobson said. The Treasury is considering changes to inheritance tax and pension tax relief. Reeves is drawing up plans for \u00a340bn in tax rises and spending cuts to avoid the real-terms cuts to departments that had been baked in under the last government\u2019s plans. It emerged this week that several cabinet ministers have written to Starmer to contest planned cuts to their department. The chancellor is also looking at increasing the national insurance contributions paid by businesses. The Guardian revealed this month that Reeves was considering levying NI on employers\u2019 pension contributions, which thinktanks say could bring in \u00a312-\u00a317bn. Increasing businesses\u2019 NI contributions will be controversial and has provoked a backlash from industry groups, who have called it a tax on jobs, but Starmer and Reeves have refused to rule it out. The prime minister told the BBC that Labour was \u201cvery clear in the manifesto that we wouldn\u2019t be increasing tax on working people\u201d but had made no commitments on employers\u2019 NI contributions. There is also growing speculation that Reeves will increase fuel duty for the first time since 2011, when it was frozen by George Osborne. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, told the broadcasters on Thursday that the government had \u201csome really tough choices\u201d to make."

            "date": "2024-10-20T14:44:17Z",
            "content": "Sitting down for his internship interview at Jane Street Capital in the summer of 2013, the future crypto-billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried was presented with a stack of poker chips and playing cards. But this was no ordinary game. Jane Street traders, renowned for their financial trading prowess, unveiled an evolving list of quirky rules, peppered with intriguing side bets, as they started to vet the potential recruit. The aim? To test whether Bankman-Fried had the problem-solving chops to join the secretive, fast-growing and high-speed trading firm that would eventually rival Wall Street behemoths such as Goldman Sachs. The future FTX boss bagged the internship, was hired full-time and was reportedly paid $300,000 (\u00a3230,000) in his first year. Jane Street, which shuns the limelight, made headlines this week when it emerged that it was advertising New York internships that came with a $250,000 salary. At that rate, the firm\u2019s next crop of interns \u2013 particularly those involved in quantitative research and engineering \u2013 will be paid more than Keir Starmer, who is paid about \u00a3167,000 ($218,000), and the head of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, who takes home $203,500. That is also while enjoying breakfast and lunch buffets, mentorship meetings and daily lectures on anything from coding to mock trades and, of course, poker. But those same highly paid interns do not need a background in markets or finance. Instead, Jane Street is offering the big bucks to graduates with experience in data science, machine learning and coding in order to propel future profits. But what is Jane Street and how is it able to offer such big cheques to its least experienced recruits? Jane Street\u2019s beginnings date back to 2000, when it was founded by an ex-IBM developer and a small group of traders in New York. In the decades that followed, it quietly became one of the biggest financial firms that most people have never heard of. It emerged as part of a new generation of quantitative trading outfits, meaning its traders use mathematics and statistics to determine how to bet on certain assets or financial markets. The company proudly declares itself to be \u201ca firm of puzzle solvers on and off the clock\u201d. It has particularly become known for its expertise in exchange trading funds (ETFs), which are investment funds made up of a portfolio of assets which are sliced up into shares that can be bought and sold on the market to investors. That is on top of becoming a major player in equities, bonds and options markets, which have helped push its trading volumes to new heights. Jane Street is notoriously secretive about its operations. \u201cThe first time a New York Times piece appeared about them, there was like a nuclear meltdown,\u201d one former employee told the author Michael Lewis for Going Infinite, his book on the rise and fall of Bankman-Fried. Part of that may stem from its flat leadership structure, with the firm led by a group of senior managers rather than a single chief executive. Its senior staff are also the equity holders, though only one of its founders, Rob Granieri, remains at the firm. It has also managed to foster a cult-like dedication from its 2,600-plus employees, who work across its five global offices in New York, Amsterdam, Hong Kong, Singapore and London. The last employs about 636 staff. Documents leaked to the Financial Times this year showed that Jane Street estimates that it accounted for 10.4% of all stock trading in North America last year and more than 2% of all trading in more than 20 countries. It reportedly made a 12-month profit of around $7.4bn, meaning it is catching up with well-known titans in US banking including Goldman Sachs, which reported $8.5bn in profits for 2023. It has helped Jane Street to continue to pay its workforce handsomely. The firm offered pay and benefits worth $2.4bn last year, an average of about $900,000 for each employee. Between its culture and pay, it seems to have found a winning combination, reportedly keeping staff turnover at just 6% over the last two years. Jane Street turned down the Guardian\u2019s request for an interview and declined to comment."

            "content": "Tech entrepreneurs will leave the UK \u201cen masse\u201d if the chancellor announces a significant increase in capital gains tax at this month\u2019s budget, according to a leading industry investor. Harry Stebbings, a British podcaster turned investor who raised a $400m (\u00a3310m) fund this week, said the UK was \u201ca bad place to do business\u201d because of its tax environment. The Guardian reported last week that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was considering raising capital gains tax (CGT) to between 33% and 39% in the budget on 30 October. Stebbings said plans to scrap the non-dom tax regime had also sent a negative signal but an increase in CGT \u2013 which is levied on the sale of assets such as shares and second homes \u2013 would pose the most serious concern to entrepreneurs. \u201cThe stance on capital gains tax is by far the biggest [issue],\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cWhy would you look to invest in the UK if you\u2019re looking at a 35% CGT rate, or wherever it lands.\u201d The 28-year-old said tech entrepreneurs would leave the UK if a significant increase in the tax was unveiled by Reeves. \u201cI know fewer entrepreneurs will be here. They will leave en masse,\u201d Stebbings said. By contrast, a group of millionaire business owners have urged Reeves to raise \u00a314bn through an increase in CGT, arguing it would have no impact on investment in Britain. The chancellor is considering raising CGT on the sale of shares but not second homes, the Times reported on Thursday. Keir Starmer, indicated this week that the tax would not rise as high as 39%, describing that number as \u201cgetting to the area which is wide of the mark\u201d. However, the prime minister did not elaborate further on the probable rate. For higher rate taxpayers CPT on residential property sales is 24% and for shares and other assets it is 20%. On Thursday a group of millionaire entrepreneurs backed a CGT rise in a report by the centre-left IPPR thinktank in which they urged Reeves to raise \u00a314bn by increasing the tax, suggesting such a move would not \u201cscare away real investors\u201d in Britain. The London-based fund led by Stebbings, 20VC, has become one of the most powerful players in European tech investment after its latest fundraising, which included backing from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Josh Kushner, the founder of OpenAI investor Thrive Capital. Stebbings\u2019s popular podcast, The Twenty Minute VC, has interviewed entrepreneurs including OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman and LinkedIn\u2019s Reid Hoffman. Stebbings told the Financial Times this week: \u201cWe leverage media to be the best investor.\u201d He said London and the UK faced competition as a tech base, with impressive talent building up elsewhere in Europe including in Paris, Munich and Amsterdam. \u201cMy job is to invest in amazing founders wherever they are,\u201dStebbings said. \u201cI hope they are in the UK, in London.\u201d He said there were \u201ca lot of things\u201d that were \u201cright with this country\u201d and that the tax situation was \u201cfixable\u201d. He added that he would continue to be based in the UK. Stebbings said the UK still had great potential to create leading tech businesses \u2013 pointing to recent success of the fintech sector and Google DeepMind, the London-based artificial intelligence research lab. \u201cThis is the country of Revolut, of Monzo, of TransferWise. We have unbelievable engineers spinning out of DeepMind. We should be building great businesses,\u201d he said. The Treasury has been approached for comment."

            "content": "People living in remote Indigenous communities are paying more than double the capital city prices for everyday groceries including flour, tasty cheese, apples and milk, new research has found. A basket of nine items, which also included penne pasta, beef mince, teabags, carrots and Weet-Bix cost $99.38 on average at four remote community stores in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, the research by Choice found. The same items cost $44.70 when averaged out across Woolworths, Coles, Aldi and IGA stores in all of Australia\u2019s capital cities, according to the consumer advocacy group. Choice has called on the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to explore capping the prices of essential supermarket items in remote communities. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email While the competition watchdog does not set supermarket prices, Choice wants the ACCC to recommend that the federal government develop an affordable pricing policy which could include price caps. Choice made the recommendation in its submission to the ACCC\u2019s ongoing inquiry into Australia\u2019s supermarket sector. To gather samples for its price comparison, Choice bought nine items from stores in the Great Sandy Desert and Pilbara regions in WA and in the West Daly region and on the Tiwi Islands in the NT in August. Their prices were then compared with those of identical groceries in capital centres around the country. The highest price was in the West Daly area, west of Darwin, where the items cost $110.82. Choice\u2019s Jarni Blakkarly said the price differences were \u201cpretty astounding\u201d. In capital cities, people paid $4.87 for a kilogram of apples on average, whereas the cost was $7.50 a kilo at the store Choice visited on the Tiwi Islands, he said. \u201cAvailability of food in the first place is also a big issue faced by people living in remote communities,\u201d he said. \u201cAt one store visited by our mystery shopper there was no bread to be found, and our shopper had to make do with frozen hotdog buns.\u201d Four years ago, a federal inquiry found there was a \u201ctenuous\u201d supply of affordable, nutritious food in many remote communities that had persisted despite multiple previous inquiries. Among the 2020 inquiry\u2019s recommendations was that the government establish real-time price monitoring across all remote community stores, to be reported publicly. Financial counsellor and Boandik woman Bettina Cooper said live price monitoring was a good idea but the government needed to cap the prices of essential items if it was \u201cserious about closing the gap\u201d. \u201cWe need to be closing the gap, not supporting profit-making, while our First Nations brothers and sisters in remote communities are struggling to feed their family,\u201d she said. Cooper, who works at Mob Strong Debt Help, disagreed with economists who said price caps would do little except reduce the supply of groceries. \u201cI\u2019d like to see them go and sit in a remote community and try and feed their family on a Centrelink payment and then have that conversation with them,\u201d she said. Prof Nitika Garg, a consumer behaviour researcher at the University of New South Wales, said higher prices in remote areas meant people were more likely to buy cheaper food that was less healthy but she was dubious about price caps. Before the Queensland election earlier this month, the Greens proposed capping prices on 30 essential groceries such as bread, milk and nappies across the state at January 2024 levels, with any price increases tied to wage increases. Prof Phil Lewis, who leads the University of Canberra\u2019s Centre for Labour Market Research, said capping prices did nothing but reduce supply. \u201cIf you actually try and reduce the price below what suppliers are willing to supply at, they\u2019ll stop so much,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019ll be scarcities arising in the shop.\u201d The University of Queensland\u2019s Prof John Quiggin said government subsidies such as his state\u2019s remote communities freight assistance scheme were a better way to bring down prices. \u201cWe need programs that reduce the cost of healthy food [in remote areas] and encourage people to have healthy diets,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is quite a separate problem from the problem we face in general, which is that prices have gone up and wages haven\u2019t.\u201d"

Hunter, a multimillionaire investor and philanthropist, was ambivalent about Scottish independence and was often critical of Scottish government policy but said Salmond had \u201cdevoted his life to Scotland\u201d. Speculation was rife about who had privately funded the charter flight due to bring Salmond\u2019s body home from North Macedonia on Friday, after he died suddenly at a lunch on Saturday.

Hunter, who donated \u00a3100,000 to the Labour party in 2001, said he wanted to end the speculation after significant media inquiries. \u201cWhile he and I disagreed on some of his ambitions, Alex Salmond devoted his life to Scotland and the Scottish people and as such he, and importantly his family, deserved the dignity and privacy of a private return to the home of his birth,\u201d he said in a short statement. \u201cOur deepest sympathy and thoughts are with his family at this time.

In 2001, he set up the investment firm West Coast Capital and took stakes in the theme parks company Merlin, the retirement homes developer McCarthy &amp; Stone, Travelodge, and Dobbies garden centres. That allowed him to claim the crown as Scotland\u2019s first homegrown billionaire in 2007, according to the Sunday Times rich list; the financial crisis in 2008 and onwards sliced a reputed \u00a3250m off that wealth.

            "content": "When Andrew Carter and Adam DeMartino started their business Smallhold in 2017, they set out with a simple vision they thought could have a big impact: feed people mushrooms. \u201cMushrooms are one of the most sustainable calories on the planet, in every aspect,\u201d Carter said, whether you\u2019re looking at water, waste, plastic use or greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cWe just wanted to get more people eating them.\u201d For the better part of seven years, Smallhold successfully did just that, getting specialty mushrooms such as shiitake, blue oyster and trumpets into grocery stores and on to Americans\u2019 plates. And they built a cult favorite brand while doing so \u2013 a feat made notable by how much harder it is to accomplish with produce than, say, processed snack foods. (Think about how differently you shop for chips or ice-cream, on the lookout for a specific brand you like, versus peaches or tomatoes, the brand of which you may not even notice.) As mushrooms became emblematic of a new vision of sustainability at the start of the pandemic lockdowns, achieving zeitgeist-y star status, Smallhold found itself both riding that wave and helping propel it, earning a range of buzzy media coverage and being valued at $90m at its peak. Just six years after starting in a shipping container in Brooklyn, the brand had built out farms in New York, Texas and California, and had begun selling in 1,400 stores across the country, including Whole Foods. \u201cWe gave others hope that a sustainable business could rise quickly, become popular, and change an entire category for the better,\u201d said DeMartino. Smallhold was just one of a host of food startups that have cropped up with the promise that they\u2019re growing food more sustainably or reducing waste. So it came as a disappointing shock to many when the founders both stepped down this spring and Smallhold announced that it was filing for bankruptcy shortly thereafter. Though the company was taken over by investors who restructured and brought the company out of bankruptcy at the end of August, Smallhold emerged as a \u201cshadow\u201d of the company DeMartino once envisioned; it shut down its farms and laid off much of its staff without severance, to the dismay of the founders and customers who had come to associate the brand with the ethical treatment of its employees and farmers as well as the earth. (The brand\u2019s current leadership declined to comment for this article.) What does the brand\u2019s trajectory mean for the prospects of using entrepreneurship to right traditional agriculture\u2019s wrongs? In the example of Smallhold and other produce-focused startups like it, there are lessons to be learned about what role business can \u2013 and can\u2019t \u2013 play in fixing our food system. Do: find a niche, and sell more than sustainability Elly Truesdell was working at Whole Foods as a \u201cforager\u201d who helped the grocery chain identify new local suppliers when Smallhold started out, and she remembers being impressed at their unique offering. Where most shoppers had only encountered the most common varieties of button mushrooms, Smallhold was introducing varieties with more interesting and varied flavor profiles, such as lion\u2019s mane and blue oyster. \u201cI traveled the country and visited a ton of local food stores and other grocers and very, very rarely could you see specialty mushrooms of the varieties that they were growing in grocery stores,\u201d she said. That\u2019s some of what convinced her, once she left Whole Foods to get into venture capital with a focus on food businesses, to invest in Smallhold. For a world increasingly thinking about both personal and planetary health, mushrooms hold great appeal as an easy and nutritious meat alternative. And Smallhold was paying farmers a living wage to grow them on waste material, using minimal water and electricity, composting the leftover materials after, and selling their product in compostable retail packaging (an industry first). But startups that gain a foothold in the produce aisle have to offer customers more than that to succeed, Truesdell said. \u201cYou cannot hang your hat on sustainability only. Product quality, cost \u2013 all of the things that matter in a typical food business still matter.\u201d In some ways, Smallhold excelled at that: in addition to the unique flavor and high quality of its produce, it also built a strong brand through a combination of the charming aesthetics of the mushrooms themselves, a witty social media presence and the relationships its founders built with tastemakers who helped cement Smallhold as part of the zeitgeist. Smallhold isn\u2019t the only produce company that has benefited from creating a unique visual identity. Bowery Farming, an indoor agriculture company that sells greens and berries, and Gotham Greens, which sells salad greens, dressings and herbs, are two others that have invested in top-notch design and branding. While all three companies have claimed to be growing food more sustainably than peer companies in their categories, their unique approach to branding produce is part of what lures in new customers, Truesdell noted. Don\u2019t: take on too much money Entrepreneurs who want their business to be sustainable by environmental standards have to also be sustainable in the financial sense of the word. Though what Smallhold set out to do was sell mushrooms that would help people \u201creconnect with their food, environment, and farmers\u201d, the technology it was using to do so was often what excited funders. \u201cOver time, we were really leading with that,\u201d said DeMartino. \u201cThe pitch got crafted around technology further and further.\u201d He often felt that they were adding tech that was cool, but overcomplicated things: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to press a button to open a window. You can just open the window,\u201d he said. Plus, creating and maintaining the technology infrastructure was expensive, which made building new farms costly. That in turn made becoming profitable more difficult to do \u2013 and when venture capitalists are looking for a return on their investment quickly, a slow path to profitability can be a death knell. \u201cVCs need their money back,\u201d said Ari Greensburg, professor of entrepreneurship and management at NYU Stern. \u201cThey need you to get there by five, six years, seven maximum ... If you can\u2019t do that, they abandon you.\u201d That is, in some sense, what happened to Smallhold: after years of ample VC funding, investors decided they weren\u2019t making enough progress toward profitability, stopped cutting them checks, and the company was left without adequate cashflow. Smallhold wasn\u2019t the only buzzy produce company to go bankrupt under these circumstances. AeroFarms and AppHarvest, two other indoor farming companies that had attracted big venture capital investments in the past, also declared bankruptcy last year when the VC landscape began to shift away from its former optimism about tech-based food startups. Lessons for other entrepreneurs It\u2019s easy to tell an entrepreneur that it\u2019s dangerous to take on VC funding, but often harder to offer viable alternatives for startups that need cash. But those options do exist, insisted Truesdell, especially for agriculture companies. She pointed to Ark Foods, a produce startup founded in 2013 that helped create the US market for shishito peppers, as an example. Though the company has taken on some modest equity investments from funds including Truesdell\u2019s, those haven\u2019t made up the bulk of the company\u2019s funding. \u201cThey rely a ton on farm credit and on loans from the Farm Bureau, rather than on venture dollars,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re almost always hovering at break-even or slightly profitable, so that they\u2019re not in this difficult situation that companies like Smallhold found themselves in.\u201d She named the family-owned salad and greens business Taylor Farms, which has opted to grow slowly over time rather than taking on big investments in the hopes of scaling up quickly, as another example of how to do things differently. There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all way to build or run a produce startup to ensure that it\u2019ll be around in the long run, and the most effective strategy for changing the food system for the better won\u2019t rely on entrepreneurship alone, but will incorporate policy change and regulation, too. But there are a few lessons worth trying to take away from the successes and failures of the startups that have tried to do so in the last few years: build a strong brand, even in a category like produce that hasn\u2019t historically been known for branding. Offer sustainability, but pair that with other values, such as new flavors or higher quality to lure in customers. And take financial responsibility just as seriously as planetary and social responsibility. \u201cNo matter how much you love it, this business runs on money, not on love,\u201d DeMartino said. \u201cWe needed to make really key decisions around that in order to sustain the vision of a circular economy business.\u201d Lastly, learn to define success on your own terms. Despite its eventual bankruptcy, Smallhold did help carve out a market across the nation for specialty mushrooms \u2013 and getting more people hooked on what could be the \u201cmost sustainable calories on the planet\u201d is a legacy the company\u2019s founders think is worth celebrating."

            "title": "More than 70 retailers urge Reeves to make 20% cut to business rates",
            "date": "2024-10-06T23:01:06Z",
            "content": "More than 70 retailers, including Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer and Ikea, are lobbying the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, for a 20% cut to business rates, warning that the property tax could force tens of thousands of shops to shut. In a letter to Reeves coordinated by the British Retail Consortium (BRC), executives are pushing the Treasury to introduce a \u201cretail rates corrector\u201d on the levy, which is a property-based tax charged by local councils and imposed on businesses including retailers, pubs, factories and company offices. They argue that a 20% discount would help \u201clevel the playing field\u201d for the sector, which they claim is paying more than its fair share of tax. BRC research suggests that retailers are paying 7.4% of all business taxes despite accounting for 4.9% of the UK\u2019s total economic output in 2023. They say this has curbed investment and forced retailers to shut their doors, affecting local jobs. Without swift action, the BRC said 17,000 shops could be forced to close over the next decade. \u201cThis tax burden is having a detrimental socioeconomic impact on local communities through store closures and job losses \u2013 in two-thirds of the 6,000 store closures in the UK over the past five years, the rates bill had a material impact on the decision to close,\u201d the letter said. \u201cRates are also holding back current investments we want to make in pay and upskilling our people, in new and improved stores and in the technology that will support productivity and economic growth.\u201d The letter \u2013 which had been signed by bosses including the M&amp;S chief executive, Stuart Machin, the Tesco UK CEO, Matthew Barnes, Aldi\u2019s Giles Hurley, B&amp;Q\u2019s Graham Bell, Costa Coffee\u2019s Nick Orrin and Ikea\u2019s UK and Ireland CEO, Peter Jelkeby \u2013 is part of efforts to influence tax policy in the runup to the new Labour government\u2019s first budget on 30 October. However, a steep discount in business rates may be a tough sell, as the chancellor tries to plug what she claims is a \u00a322bn hole in the public finances. Figures provided by the BRC said that the retail sector paid more than \u00a36bn in business rates last year, meaning that a 20% discount would cost the government about \u00a31.2bn. The retail sector has long complained about its tax bill. However, pressure mounted over the past two years, when an increase in inflation caused business rates to rise. The UK\u2019s September inflation figure \u2013 which in September 2023 was 6.7% \u2013 is typically used to decide the annual increase in business rates. In the party\u2019s pre-election manifesto, Labour pledged to replace the business rates system in England with a fairer regime, saying the current arrangement disincentivised investment, created uncertainty and placed an \u201cundue burden on our high streets\u201d, However, it has yet to outline what that new system will look like. The former Conservative government held several consultations on reforming business rates but failed to change the system during their time in office. \u201cRetail has been the golden goose, generating tax revenues far beyond the industry\u2019s size, but the current situation is not sustainable,\u201d said Helen Dickinson, the BRC\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe government should act to rebalance the system and ensure all industries are paying their fair share. This in turn would drive increased retail investment in people, places and communities. \u201cThe budget is the perfect opportunity to lay the groundwork for local investment that delivers for retail\u2019s customers, delivers for its employees, and delivers for the economy.\u201d A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cThe chancellor has vowed to lead the most pro-growth, pro-business Treasury in the country\u2019s history. Early action has already been taken to unlock investment to advance our national mission of growth.\u201d \u201cThe government\u2019s manifesto committed to a fairer business rates system which levels the playing field between the high street and online giants, incentivises investment, tackles empty properties and supports entrepreneurship.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-18T21:02:45Z",
            "content": "Five years ago, with an eye toward South Carolina\u2019s 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Kamala Harris dropped by a barbershop in the state capital for a roundtable with a group of Black men led by 2 Live Crew\u2019s Luther Campbell, of Me So Horny fame. Pitted against some skeptical voters, Harris won the room over with her personal stories and willingness to let her hair down some. \u201cI\u2019m all about straight talk, and there\u2019s no better place to do that than in the barbershop,\u201d she said. In that 20-minute discussion, which largely focused on entrepreneurship, Harris introduced many of the points that form the core of the Opportunity Agenda for Black Men unveiled this week. The Black barbershop ranks among the most enduring tropes in American politics \u2013 the go-to place for office-seekers looking to win the Black male vote without getting into specifics. Democrats in particular have used the setting as their official co-sign, submitting to naturalistic photo-ops in hydraulic chairs with the fellas when they aren\u2019t directly addressing Black church congregations or glad-handing at fish fries. Even Donald Trump has leveraged the barbershop trope for his own ends, dropping by a Maga-friendly location in the Bronx on Thursday for a private meet-and-greet. A product of segregation, the Black barbershop is as much a symbol of Black entrepreneurship as it is a safe space for Black men to socialize and strategize \u2013 at no point more so than during the civil rights movement. Harris could have easily gone back to the barbershop for this presidential campaign. Instead, she built from that foundation while huddling with Black male leaders away from the cameras and doing interviews with Charlamagne tha God, two former NBA players and other Black media tastemakers who cultivate a barbershop vibe with audiences. Popular narratives of Harris are at pains to characterize her as unpopular with Black men. Some polling data has detected a slight rightward drift among young Black men. But that\u2019s only part of the picture, the pollster Henry Fernandez argues. His firm, the African American Research Collaborative, has tracked voter attitudes over the past decade and found that young Black men, more so than young women, are more willing to consider a Republican candidate initially than older Black voters but eventually come home to the Democrats \u2013 which sets them apart from other young voters in other racial and cultural groups, who start out more open to considering progressives. \u201cIt reflects the fact that Black men are making a choice,\u201d says Fernandez before raising three polls he took in the run-up to the 2020 election. \u201cIn July, Black men were at 43% support for Joe Biden. In September, it was 78%. In November, it was 86%. Black men\u2019s support for Democratic candidates doesn\u2019t start out at 100%. It consolidates.\u201d Which is to say: Harris still enjoys widespread backing from Black voters in the aggregate. But her campaign has made a mission of addressing dubious Black male voters regardless. This week, while thanking Harris volunteers at a campaign field office in Pittsburgh, Barack Obama openly wondered whether Black male voters might be holding out on supporting Harris because they \u201cjust aren\u2019t feeling the idea of having a woman as president\u201d. Harris, though, isn\u2019t deterred. Through her dogged outreach to Black male voters, she has underscored the value of their vote while demonstrating how the idea of the Black barbershop as a catch-all forum has evolved. \u201cFirst of all, my barber comes to me,\u201d says Roland Martin, the former CNN contributor turned Black digital media maven. \u201cThe reason why I\u2019m saying this is because Democrats are still trying to figure out where Black men are congregating.\u201d Obama has done more than any candidate to stress the importance of the Black barbershop, including campaign stops in 2008 and 2012 \u2013 by which point Coming to America, Barbershop and other films had entrenched the Black barbershop in the mainstream imagination. Before the 2020 election, Obama appeared on The Shop, LeBron James\u2019s barbershop-inspired TV showcase for freeform conversations with luminaries from disparate arenas, to make a last-ditch pitch for Joe Biden. For Obama, the barbershop was a platform to relate the broad strokes of his cultural identity to Black men who remained wary \u2013 his obsession with sports, his pride in his Black family; at a 2012 barbershop stop in South Carolina, he traded the dozens with waiting customers before grabbing a quick shape-up. Harris, though, is more intentional about using the barbershop trope to relate her personal biography. In an April interview with BuzzFeed, she shared her \u201chair story\u201d, an allusion that hints at the fraught politics of Black hair care. At the barber shop in South Carolina in 2019, she made sure to let the brothers know she grew up celebrating Kwanzaa, a weeklong winter celebration of African American culture that was invented by a Black male PhD.

Get our free app and sign up for election alerts As much as this stretch-run media tour might look like a last-minute plan for Harris, it\u2019s worth remembering: a) she\u2019s only been in the race for two months; and b) chopping it up with Black men is not a new look for her. Those who have only just tuned in might not fully appreciate that Harris is a Howard University-educated member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority \u2013 bona fides that have kept her connected to a cultural network that includes leadership-minded Black men, a number of whom have signed on to organizing efforts like the Win With Black Men Pac. \u201cShe\u2019s been meeting with Black men for years,\u201d says Martin, a graduate of a historically Black college who is prominently active in the Pac. \u201cI was part of a dinner that she did with a group of Black men in November of last year. She was at the 100 Black Men conference in Atlanta earlier this year. At the Howard-Hampton football game in DC at the beginning of the year. Folks just had no idea because the vice-president is not covered like the president. The issue is the national media.\u201d Even as Harris met with mainstream media outlets over the past two weeks, she was careful to signal to the Black men who might also be paying attention. On 60 Minutes, she sat down with Bill Whitaker, the program\u2019s lone Black correspondent. On Howard Stern, she came out as an F1 fan who cheers for Lewis Hamilton, the series\u2019 only Black driver. On Fox News she pushed back against the host Bret Baier\u2019s attempts to cast her as incompetent and in over her head \u2013 and, of course, was labeled an \u201cangry Black woman\u201d by Trump supporters for standing her ground. \u201cWent to @FoxNews with 787 million reasons not to, and looked presidential, held her own and portrayed poise,\u201d wrote Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina state representative turned Harris surrogate. Elsewhere, Harris took the extra step of appearing on digital platforms with robust Black male followings. On All the Smoke, a sports podcast hosted by the NBA retirees Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson, she stated a desire to promote on-ramps for Black men into the cannabis industry while coming out in favor of decriminalizing marijuana. On Monday, Harris appeared on Martin\u2019s daily digital show and stressed the importance of creating more Black homeowners and uplifting Black-owned businesses. Both ideas are central tenets of her opportunity agenda \u2013 her plan to give Black men more economic opportunities through forgivable business loans, decriminalizing marijuana and protecting cryptocurrency investments. In a Tuesday digital town hall with Charlamagne tha God, co-host of The Breakfast Club, Harris reinterpreted Obama\u2019s rebuke of Black male voters as a call to arms. (\u201cWhat is happening here is we are all working on reminding everyone of what is at stake,\u201d Harris said.) She popped up again later that night at the Hip Hop awards on BET \u2013 the same network that sounded the alarm on Project 2025 at another awards show back in July. On Tuesday\u2019s show, Harris was interviewed by the rapper Fat Joe \u2013 who met with the Democratic nominee and the Kentucky governor, Andy Beshear, a rumored VP pick, in March to discuss marijuana reform. \u201cWhen the vice-president calls me,\u201d Joe said at the White House summit, \u201cI drop everything.\u201d For the past six weeks, the actor Wendell Pierce, a prominent Harris surrogate, has hosted talks at Black barbershops in key districts around the country with special guests and film screenings to drum up voter enthusiasm. This week, he pushed back against Obama\u2019s rebuke, urging Democrats to \u201cstop scapegoating Black men\u201d in an X post. In a Thursday CNN appearance, the Wire star revealed that Obama had called him in response to his post \u2013 and he further explained to the former president that Black men just wanted to be heard and taken seriously. With each appearance she makes, Harris proves that there is no such thing as a Black male monolith, or field offices where those brothers can be reliably reached any more. By meeting Black men where they are and taking in their straight talk, she doesn\u2019t just make clear that she isn\u2019t pandering for a photo op; she shows that she\u2019s willing to go farther than any presidential candidate in history to earn the Black male vote."

            "title": "Millionaire business owners urge Rachel Reeves to raise \u00a314bn from rise in capital gains tax ",
            "date": "2024-10-17T04:01:03Z",
            "content": "Rachel Reeves has been urged by a group of millionaire business owners to raise \u00a314bn from an increase in capital gains tax at this month\u2019s budget, arguing it would have no impact on investment in Britain. Ahead of the chancellor\u2019s set-piece event on 30 October, the group of wealthy investors said increasing the tax rate on asset disposals would help to raise vital funds for public services and would not lead to slower economic growth. In a report by the centre-left IPPR thinktank, which carries influence with the Treasury, the millionaire entrepreneurs said they would welcome an increase in the rate levied on capital gains to match the higher rate of income tax. The report showed that capital gains tax (CGT) was not a primary driver of investment decisions, with entrepreneurs more focused on issues including access to financing, market opportunities, and broader economic conditions. Mark Campbell, the millionaire co-founder of Higgidy pies, said higher rates of CGT would not \u201cscare away real investors\u201d in Britain. \u201cEntrepreneurs don\u2019t think about [it] when they create businesses. [It] would not have stopped us investing in Higgidy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe UK needs a fairer tax system to invest in its future, and those of us who\u2019ve benefited the most should contribute more so that we have a healthy society and economy for future entrepreneurs to operate within.\u201d Graham Hobson, the millionaire co-founder of Photobox, a photo printing website, said: \u201cThe idea that raising capital gains tax would discourage entrepreneurship is simply a myth. Entrepreneurs are driven by passion, problem-solving, and creating value \u2013 not by low taxes.\u201d Julia Davies, a millionaire investor who has backed companies including Osprey outdoor equipment, said: \u201cAs an entrepreneur and investor, I\u2019ve never let tax rates dictate my decisions to fund innovation or pursue opportunities.\u201d At present, the top rate of income tax is set at 45%, but most types of capital gain are taxed at 20% and can be as low as 10%. It is levied on the sale of shares, second homes and businesses. The report recommended equalising CGT rates with income tax rates \u2013 representing the reinstatement of the system introduced by the Conservative chancellor Nigel Lawson in the 1988 budget. This would entail a rate of 20% for basic rate income tax payers, 40% for the higher rate, and 45% for the additional rate. Earlier this month, the Guardian revealed that Reeves was exploring increasing CGT to a range of 33% to 39% in the budget, as she considers options for raising up to \u00a340bn to meet a \u201cgolden rule\u201d to balance day-to-day spending with revenue. However, HMRC analysis suggests that a large increase in CGT rates could end up costing the exchequer money because such a move could lead wealthy individuals to rearrange their tax affairs or leave the country to avoid paying higher rates. The tax raises about \u00a315bn a year, less than 2% of total tax revenue. Paid by 350,000 people, less than 1% of the adult population, as much as two-thirds of all revenue for the exchequer comes from a small subset of super-rich individuals who gain more than \u00a31m. Earlier this summer, HMRC said that while a 1% increase in the higher rates of CGT would raise \u00a3100m in 2027-28, that a 10 percentage point increase would actually cut revenues by about \u00a32bn that year. Pranesh Narayanan, research fellow at IPPR, said the tax office had not published the behavioural assumptions behind its analysis, which he said were likely to be outdated, and did not take account of broader reforms to CGT that would be required to raise \u00a314bn. \u201cThe recent fearmongering from some that increasing capital gains tax will take the economy back to the stone ages is pure hyperbole,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have spoken to multiple millionaires in the last few weeks who have made it clear that equalising capital gains tax with income tax would make absolutely no difference to their investment or entrepreneurial pursuits.\u201d A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cWe do not comment on speculation around tax changes outside of fiscal events.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-21T21:01:42Z",
            "content": "Employment rights reforms could cost businesses up to \u00a35bn a year, according to the government\u2019s own analysis, which also found the changes will benefit low-paid employees the most, with some shift workers potentially earning an extra \u00a3600 a year. In the analysis the government acknowledges that businesses will end up paying more, including for changes to sick pay, paternity leave and zero-hours contracts as well as on administrative costs. However, it found that many of the mental health and physical benefits to families and workers would save significant sums. Speaking in parliament before the bill\u2019s second reading on Monday, the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, said that most employers were already complying with the changes stipulated in the bill. She said the strengthening of workers\u2019 rights would help the economy grow long-term: \u201cSuccessful firms already know that strong employee rights mean strong growth opportunities. This landmark legislation will extend the employment protections given by the best British companies to millions more workers.\u201d The shadow business secretary, Kevin Hollinrake, said the costs \u201ccould sink\u201d some businesses, particularly those hit by new employment claims. \u201cThis is not a employment rights bill but a trade union charter,\u201d he said. The government said the costs were minimal \u2013 less than 1.5% \u2013 when compared with total employment costs and that most of the cost would represent a redistribution from companies to their workers. Total wage costs in the UK were \u00a31.3tn in 2023. Business groups said they risked being \u201cburied under a mountain of additional cost\u201d and cautioned against rushing the measures through. Shevaun Haviland, of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cThe cost burden will fall hardest on the millions of small and medium-sized firms which are the backbone of the economy. \u201cBusiness anxiety is already growing ahead of next week\u2019s budget. We share the government\u2019s desire to see sustained economic growth and are committed to working with them to reach that target. But that can\u2019t happen if businesses are buried under a mountain of additional cost.\u201d UKHospitality, which represents pubs, hotels and restaurants, welcomed the bill, but its chief executive, Kate Nicholls, called on the government to \u201cget the details right, through close consultation with businesses to avoid unintended consequences\u201d. She said zero-hours contracts were the desired contract for 90% of people on them, who wanted flexibility. A near-ban on zero-hours contracts is the biggest cost, totalling up to \u00a32bn. The government said the right to guaranteed hours could itself cost up to \u00a31bn \u2013 much directly passed on to workers \u2013 and the right to reasonable notice of shift cancellation could also cost \u00a31bn. The analysis said that the government \u201cexpect[s] that business behaviour will change so fewer shifts are cancelled, but the value of unavoidable cancellations could still be as high as \u00a3120m a year\u201d. The change is projected to save workers significant money \u2013 not just payment for shifts missed but for the costs of extra wasted childcare or transport, labelled \u201cthe insecurity premium\u201d. The government said that could be \u00a3600 a year for some, worth over \u00a3250 more a year than the last two national insurance cuts. The analysis found it would cost about \u00a3100m to enforce the right to unfair dismissal claims from day one of a new job, though it was likely the policy would reduce the risk to employees of switching jobs. Based on current patterns, the new rights could also lead to a significant rise in mediation or legal action \u2013 an increase of about 15%, which would mean an extra 20,000 additional complaints to the Acas mediation and arbitration service, 4,750 more employment tribunal cases and 875 additional cases which may require a full hearing. Other costs likely to be incurred are up to \u00a31bn in the changes to statutory sick pay, and about \u00a3100m in costs each for new rights such as bereavement leave, day one paternity leave and unpaid parental leave. Department for Work and Pensions analysis suggests the extra payments made by employers are expected to cost about \u00a3400m a year. In the analysis, the government said there were benefits that could not be easily quantified in terms of secure work and a more well-rounded family life. It said that 17m working days were lost due to stress, depression or anxiety, equivalent to more than \u00a35bn of lost output in a single year. Ministers and the Trades Union Congress have argued that the reforms are popular with voters. The TUC\u2019s general secretary, Paul Nowak, said: \u201cDespite repeated attempts to paint this bill as bad for business, this rigorous impact assessment shows that the business costs are negligible and are more than offset by the wider economic and social gains. \u201cThese changes will mostly affect those companies whose business models have been built on low-paid, insecure employment.\u201d A separate poll ahead of the budget shows voters want ministers to spend money repairing Britain\u2019s public services, even if it means increasing debt and even breaking manifesto pledges on tax. Polling by the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, carried out by Persuasion UK and shared with the Treasury and No 10, shows that swing voters in particular prioritise spending money on the public sector over reducing tax. The swings were even more pronounced among those who had switched their vote at the last election than among the voting population as a whole. The polling also shows voters are more likely to react favourably to the argument that Labour is having to raise taxes and borrowing to rebuild public services rather than to fix a budget black hole left behind by the previous government. There are signs the message is being heard at the top of government. Whitehall sources confirmed on Monday that Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, had agreed to top up the government\u2019s affordable housing programme after a standoff between her and Rayner. Reeves is likely to give less than \u00a31bn to the fund, however, despite warnings from social housing providers that they would need at least an additional \u00a32bn before the programme expires in 2026."

            "date": "2024-10-09T23:01:27Z",
            "content": "Labour\u2019s employment rights bill is the biggest step towards enacting one of its key election offers: to make sweeping changes to rights at work and improve pay. Here are the main details of the legislation, though much of it will take more than two years to consult on and implement. Day-one rights Workers will qualify for protection against unfair dismissal from day one \u2013 a benefit for 9 million people. Previously, employees must have been at their place of work for at least two years in order to qualify. There will also be day-one rights for paternity leave and unpaid parental leave. Maternity leave is already a day-one right. A full review of all parental-leave rights is promised alongside the bill. An extra 30,000 fathers or partners will be brought into scope for paternity leave, while an additional 1.5 million parents will gain flexibility, with unpaid parental leave becoming a right from day one. There will also be a requirement for employers to establish a policy for bereavement leave. Sick pay There will be a universal entitlement to sick pay from the first day of illness for employees. Workers will get rights to sick pay from day one, rather than from day four. Statutory sick pay is \u00a3116.75 a week and can be paid for up to 28 weeks, as long as the employee is earning an average of at least \u00a3123 a week. The government says this will be \u201cstrengthened\u201d by removing the lower earnings limit for all workers; though the rate could be lower for workers who aren\u2019t eligible for sick pay at all. Probation The government will consult on a statutory probation period for new hires; employees will still be able to claim for unfair dismissal. Ministers say this means there will be a \u201clighter touch\u201d approach to letting an employee go during the probation period if the role is not working out. The probation period will be consulted on and introduced in autumn 2026 to coincide with the enforcement of the new rights. The government now favours a limit of nine months\u2013 lengthened after pressure from businesses \u2013 which caused some disquiet among trade unions which had asked for a limit of six months. Zero-hours contracts More than 1 million people on zero-hours contracts will gain guaranteed working hours if they want them. Those workers, along with those on low-hours contracts, will have the right to a guaranteed-hours contract if they work regular hours over a defined period, which Labour\u2019s original proposal said would be 12 weeks. Employees can also request to remain on zero-hours contracts if that is what they would prefer. Fire and rehire Fire and rehire practices will be banned in all but the most extreme circumstances, meaning employers cannot sack employees and rehire them on worse terms and conditions. There will be carve-outs, however \u2013 a move that has caused consternation from unions. Businesses at risk of complete collapse may be able to alter terms and conditions if it is the difference between going bust. Flexible working The law will change to make flexible working the default \u201cwhere practical\u201d, and action plans must be drawn up to address gender pay gaps and to support female employees through menopause. There will also be stronger protections against dismissal during pregnancy and after returning to work from maternity leave. Enforcement The bill will establish an enforcement body called the Fair Work Agency, bringing together existing enforcement bodies, which will also enforce rights such as holiday pay. The remit of the new body is not likely to be fully clear until all the measures in the bill have been consulted on or enacted. Minimum wage The government plans to change the remit of the Low Pay Commission so it must take into account the cost of living when setting the minimum wage and remove all the age bands that set lower minimum wage for younger staff. It will mean a pay rise for hundreds of thousands of young workers. What\u2019s missing? There are significant gaps in the bill compared to the promises Labour made in its original \u201cnew deal for working people\u201d. But a document is planned that will promise to implement at least 30 more proposals, including: Guidance \u2013 but not legislation \u2013 on the right to switch off, preventing employees from being contacted out of hours, except in exceptional circumstances. Legislation to end pay discrimination, which is expected to come separately in a draft bill that will include measures to make it mandatory for large employers to report their ethnicity and disability pay gap. A consultation on a move towards a single status of worker \u2013 one of the most important changes that has been left out of the bill, which Labour sources have said needs a much longer consultation period. Reviews into the parental leave and carers\u2019 leave systems. Trade unions Union rights were a big part of the plans, though the commitments are often being delivered through other means. Angela Rayner has written to government departments telling them not to enact the Tories\u2019 minimum level of service bill and changes will be made to other union restrictions enacted by the Tories. New rights to online balloting are also expected to be introduced but no new legislation is required to do this."

            "date": "2024-10-12T11:41:11Z",
            "content": "A woman who sued her former employer over not being given a leaving card lost her case when it was revealed it had been hidden from her after only three people signed it. Karen Conaghan claimed that the \u201cfailure to acknowledge her existence\u201d at IAG, the parent company of British Airways, was a breach of equality law. However, a former colleague told an employment tribunal that managers had indeed bought a card but did not present it to Conaghan because of the low number of signatures, the Times reported. The judge, Kevin Palmer, said: \u201cHe believed it would have been more insulting to give her the card than not to give her a card at all.\u201d The tribunal was told that two men also laid off during \u201crestructuring\u201d at the company, which also owns airlines Aer Lingus and Iberia, did not receive leaving cards either. Conaghan, a former business liaison lead, brought 40 complaints against the company for sexual harassment, victimisation and unfair dismissal. But the tribunal dismissed every claim, with Palmer concluding that Conaghan, who started working at the company in 2019, had adopted a \u201cconspiracy-theory mentality\u201d, mistaking \u201cnormal workplace interactions\u201d for harassment. In one claim, she said a colleague had copied her use of the word \u201cwhiz\u201d in a card for a colleague, but corrected her spelling by writing \u201cwhizz\u201d instead. She said another employee had asked her: \u201cAre you taking the piss, Karen?\u201d The tribunal heard that this was after Conaghan suggested she had \u201cdone all of the hard work\u201d and it was his \u201cturn to do some\u201d. Conaghan moved to Richmond, North Yorkshire, in September 2021 despite it being expected that all employees live within two hours of the office in Heathrow, the tribunal heard. She was made redundant in the same year as part of a restructuring of the organisation, with colleagues saying in evidence that many people also left around the same time. Judge Palmer said that although further signatures were gathered on the leaving card after her departure, a former colleague took the view that \u201cit was inappropriate to send such a card to [her] at a later date as she had raised a grievance against him and [another colleague]\u201d. Many of the acts cited in the claim \u201ceither did not happen or, if they did happen, they were innocuous interactions in the normal course of employment\u201d, the judge ruled. He said that there was no evidence to suggest that any of Conaghan\u2019s allegations were in any way related to her sex and that one of the allegations was indicative of her \u201cview of normal interactions being something more sinister\u201d. In another, unrelated case earlier this year, an employment tribunal judge ruled that sending an employee an unwanted birthday card could amount to \u201cunwanted conduct\u201d and harassment."

            "date": "2024-10-31T14:00:22Z",
            "content": "The deputy prime minister\u2019s chief of staff has accused the government of ignoring her bullying complaint and stonewalling on her unresolved employment situation, appealing directly to the prime minister to intervene. Guardian Australia reported three weeks ago Jo Tarnawsky\u2019s concerns she had not heard from her boss, Richard Marles, since May and had been barred from her office without 24 hours\u2019 notice, after she made a complaint about behaviour by some staff that she felt was bullying and was moved out of her job. She remains technically employed but is unable to perform her role and has been forced to take blocks of miscellaneous leave since the short-term contract for a specially created position ended last month. Tarnawsky has now written to Anthony Albanese urging him to resolve the impasse, which she alleged in her letter had not progressed since she publicised her situation on 10 October. Tarnawsky\u2019s letter, seen by Guardian Australia, asked Albanese to deal personally with what she described as \u201cmatters of accountability\u201d. She wrote that there had been no official contact from the government in the past three weeks. \u201cMy lawyer\u2019s letter on 16 October to the Deputy Prime Minister and your office proposing a resolution remains unacknowledged,\u201d she wrote. She sent the letter to Albanese on Thursday and, 70 minutes later, received the first formal response to her 16 October letter \u2013 not from Marles but from the commonwealth\u2019s lawyers. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email In her letter to Albanese, Tarnawsky wrote that she had not been made aware of any investigation into her complaint since she raised it. She said the matter has been shifted away from the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service and that Marles has now referred it to Comcover \u2013 the government\u2019s insurer. \u201cI was taken aback to learn that not just the same external law firm, but the same individual lawyers engaged by the \u2018independent\u2019 PWSS have now been appointed by Comcover to act for it,\u201d she wrote to Albanese. \u201cThey have indicated my case will not be resolved quickly. Further, Comcover does not have any remit to engage on the most important items I have raised \u2013 namely, on accountability for the failures I have highlighted.\u201d The letter Tarnawsky received on Thursday afternoon came from the lawyers representing Comcover. In her letter to Albanese, she asked him to consider taking action under the ministerial code of conduct by referring her allegations to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission for investigation, reviewing Marles\u2019 position as chair of the government staffing committee and issuing an apology acknowledging that her treatment \u201chas fallen short of the standards set by your government\u201d. A spokesperson for the prime minister said that as lawyers were now engaged, it was not appropriate to comment in detail. \u201cThere are established and appropriate processes that must be followed when a claim is made against the commonwealth and those steps are being followed,\u201d the spokesperson said. Tarnawsky\u2019s lawyer, Marque Lawyers\u2019 managing partner, Michael Bradley, said his client was \u201cdoing everything within her power\u201d to have the situation resolved, short of suing her boss. \u201cHer preference would be that this is resolved,\u201d Bradley said. He said his client had proposed a solution but declined to detail it publicly. \u201cShe wants her situation resolved because she\u2019s in exactly the same situation she was in three weeks ago. Nothing has changed at all and she\u2019s still in exactly the same limbo and that\u2019s untenable.\u201d In parliament on 10 October, Marles called Tarnawsky a \u201cwonderful person\u201d who had worked for him in 2012 and who he re-employed as his chief of staff after Labor won the 2022 election. \u201cIt\u2019s to state the obvious that, in this moment, I feel very sad that events have got to where they have,\u201d Marles told the House of Representatives in response to an opposition question about the workplace situation. \u201cThis is obviously very difficult.\u201d Marles insisted he had upheld workplace standards in his dealings with Tarnawsky and had managed the situation \u201cwith Jo\u2019s welfare in mind at every moment\u201d. In response to questions from Guardian Australia about the status of Tarnawsky\u2019s complaint and her criticisms of the government, a spokesperson for Marles pointed to the deputy prime minister\u2019s comments in parliament in which he said that as the matter was in the hands of lawyers, it was difficult for him to say any more. Tarnawsky told Guardian Australia on Thursday that Marles \u2013 who remains her employer \u2013 had not responded to correspondence that proposed a resolution. \u201cMy personal belongings remain in my office,\u201d she said. \u201cI retain government IT devices. The situation is completely untenable.\u201d She said she had tried \u201cincredibly hard to resolve this privately over many months\u201d and was asking the prime minister to \u201cmeet the standard his government set\u201d. \u201cIt was never my intention to go public. But the government\u2019s continuing inaction has pushed me to this. They\u2019re not taking this seriously \u2026 The government seems determined to bury its head in the sand in the hope I will magically disappear. But I will not.\u201d"

            "content": "The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist has warned against cutting interest rates \u201ctoo far or too fast\u201d, a day after the governor, Andrew Bailey, said the central bank could move \u201cmore aggressively\u201d to lower borrowing costs. Huw Pill said there should be a gradual reduction in interest rates to make sure inflation remains near the Bank\u2019s 2% target. The pound, which fell steeply on Thursday after Bailey\u2019s comments in an interview with the Guardian, initially recovered some of its losses on Friday, before falling again to a fresh three-week low of $1.307. Analysts said the dollar was helped by a rise in job creation across the US after non-farm payrolls increased by 254,000 in September \u2013 more than 100,000 higher than had been expected. The unemployment rate also dipped to 4.1%, down from the 4.2% in the previous month, suggesting there was likely to be a delay to further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Pill, who sits on the Bank\u2019s nine-member interest rate setting committee chaired by Bailey, said: \u201cWhile further cuts in Bank rate remain in prospect should the economic and inflation outlook evolve broadly as expected, it will be important to guard against the risk of cutting rates either too far or too fast.\u201d Speaking in London at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, he added: \u201cFor me, the need for such caution points to a gradual withdrawal of monetary policy restriction.\u201d Pill said he feared a return of inflation after the recent cost of living crisis, which depressed the incomes of many households. \u201cThe recent cost of living crisis was a salutary reminder of the dislocation and pain inflation imposes, especially on the less well-off and small and medium-sized enterprises \u2013 already vulnerable segments of the economy that may struggle to protect themselves from higher prices,\u201d he said. \u201cOn this basis, price stability should not be seen as the obsession of remote technocrats in Threadneedle Street. Rather price stability is a foundation \u2013 you could even argue, the foundation \u2013 of a thriving, modern, vigorous and growing UK market economy, which provides opportunities for all: precisely what I would envisage as an \u2018economy fit for the future\u2019,\u201d he added. Bailey had told the Guardian that the Bank could become a \u201cbit more aggressive\u201d in cutting interest rates provided inflation data remained on track. The pound lost almost 2% of its value as investors bet that interest rates in the UK would be cut at a faster pace over the next year than previously expected, offering lower returns on savings. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) last month voted to leave interest rates at 5%, after a quarter-point cut in August. Markets are pricing in another quarter-point cut to 4.75% at the MPC\u2019s November meeting. Structural changes in the economy after the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war were uppermost in his mind, Pill said. The increase in the number of people leaving the labour market because of ill health has alarmed many policymakers who are concerned it will force employers to bid up wages as they compete for a smaller pool of skilled workers. Pill said: \u201cI remain concerned about the possibility of structural changes sustaining more lasting inflationary pressures.\u201d"

The gains lifted the number of extra jobs since the Albanese government took office to more than 1 million, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said. The unemployment rate in September was 4.1%, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on Thursday. Economists had predicted the rate would remain at the 4.2% rate initially reported for August. The ABS has now revised August\u2019s rate down to 4.1% The economy added 64,100 jobs last month. Economists had predicted a net gain of 25,000 jobs, or about half the 47,500 created in August, according to the ABS. Of the new jobs created in September, 51,600 were full-time roles. The participation rate, one measure of the share of working-age people in the labour market, came in at a record 67.2%. Hours worked also increased to 1.97bn. The strength of the labour market has been one reason why most households have so far been able to weather the sharpest burst of inflation and interest rate hikes in three decades. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Still, shrinking job ads and vacancies point to an emerging weakness in employment. Both Treasury and the RBA are forecasting the jobless rate will rise to about 4.4-4.5% by the middle of 2025, a figure still lower than most years since the mid-1970s. Prior to Thursday\u2019s release, the Albanese government had said almost 978,000 jobs had been added since it came to office in May 2022 and today\u2019s addition tipped that number over the 1 million mark. The next closest tally, in absolute terms, was the final term of the Howard government between 2004 and 2007. \u201cThis is the first and only time any government of any political persuasion has overseen the creation of a million new jobs in a single parliamentary term,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cWe welcome the fact that the majority of these million new jobs are full time and around half are for women.\u201d Whether the government can maintain those bragging rights will depend on the timing of the federal election and whether the RBA has started cutting its cash rate by then. Ahead of the latest data, investors were betting on a 40% chance of a rate reduction by December and a 70% chance by February. The Australian dollar moved about a third of a US cent higher to just under 67 US cents and stocks pared their gains for the day after the jobs figures landed. Those moves implied investors had reduced their estimates of how soon the RBA would be cutting the cash rate. \u201cUltimately, this means less pressure on the RBA to bring forward its rate cut timeline,\u201d said Russel Chesler, the head of investments and capital markets at VanEck. \u201cThe hot jobs market is preventing inflation from falling much further, as it is keeping services inflation persistently high. \u201cThe market is pricing in cuts to start by February 2025, but we believe rate cuts will start much later in 2025.\u201d Bjorn Jarvis, the head of labour statistics at the ABS, said employment had risen 3.1% in the past year, outpacing the 2.5% population growth pace. The employment-to-population ratio had lifted by 0.4 percentage points over that time to a record 64.4%. \u201cWhile the number of unemployed people fell slightly to 616,000 in September, overall the number of unemployed has risen by around 90,000 people since September 2023,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite this rise over the last year, there are still around 93,000 fewer unemployed people than there were just before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, when the unemployment rate was at 5.2%.\u201d"

The yield \u2013 in effect the interest rate \u2013 on benchmark 10-year UK government bonds rose by more than 0.15 percentage points to trade above 4.5% on Thursday, before falling back slightly, as financial markets reacted to Labour\u2019s first budget in 14 years. The pound also fell against the US dollar, while the FTSE 100 index lost ground amid a broader global sell-off, reflecting wider jitters over the prospect of the world\u2019s most powerful central banks keeping interest rates higher for longer. \u201cThe quiet optimism that appeared to be spreading during Rachel Reeves\u2019s speech has evaporated and a higher risk premium has returned for UK debt,\u201d said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the investment service Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cBond yields are set to stay volatile, as institutions financing government borrowing keep a more suspicious eye trained on what the swollen investment budget will be spent on.\u201d In a historic budget to begin the task of repairing battered public services and rebooting economic growth, the chancellor announced a \u00a370bn increase in spending on services and infrastructure, with more than half funded by higher taxes. City analysts said Reeves had announced a more expansionary package than anticipated, including higher near-term borrowing, before hitting her newly revised fiscal rules within five years. This would lead the government to sell more bonds, known as gilts, to cover its financing needs, analysts said. The chancellor\u2019s plans would also increase inflation, with potential to complicate the path for the Bank of England to cut interest rates. \u201cThe sell-off across the gilt curve is likely partly reflective of higher than expected issuance projections after the current fiscal year,\u201d said Shreyas Gopal, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. \u201cThe stakes are now also higher for next week\u2019s Bank of England meeting.\u201d Before the budget, financial markets widely expected the central bank to cut interest rates from their current 5% to about 3.75% by the end of next year, with a first quarter-point reduction on Thursday next week. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent Treasury watchdog, said it had raised its prediction for the base rate by 0.25 percentage points across its five-year forecast to reflect the additional stimulus Reeves\u2019s budget would have on the economy. Financial markets moved after the budget to price in fewer reductions in the base rate, predicting it would reach about 4% by the end of next year. Analysts said that while rising gilt yields reflected concerns in financial markets over Reeves\u2019s budget, the movements still stopped considerably short of the fallout triggered by Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget. David Page and Gabriella Dickens of Axa Investment Managers said: \u201cIn terms of the overall market assessment this should in no way be compared to the disastrous mini-budget delivered under Liz Truss\u2019s short reign in 2022. \u201cOn that day, gilt yields jumped 33 basis points and went on to rise by 100 basis points over the next three sessions.\u201d"

However, the ONS said the data was volatile, and especially after a series of one-off bonuses awarded to NHS and civil service staff last year that had fallen out of the annual statistics, dragging down the figures for total earnings by more than would be expected. In a sign of weakness in the labour market, the unemployment rate \u2013 which covers the whole of the UK \u2013 nudged down to 4% in the June to August period, while vacancies fell almost back to the long-term average experienced before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The last time annual pay growth fell below 5% was in June 2022, when the inflation rate had soared to 9.4% in response to rising energy and food prices. The consumer prices index has tracked downwards steadily over the past two years to hit 2% in May before a modest rise during the summer to 2.2% in August. Policymakers at the Bank of England have cut interest rates only once in response to falling inflation \u2013 from 5.25% to 5% \u2013 arguing that the relatively high level of wages could spark a rebound in shop prices. Pressure has mounted from business and consumer groups for further cuts after a slowdown in economic growth, which is expected to be flat in the third quarter of this year after an increase of more than 1% in the first half. Tax rises in Rachel Reeves\u2019s 30 October budget could also drag on economic growth, despite promises of a boost to spending on infrastructure over the rest of the parliament. The chancellor has promised to close a \u00a322bn spending gap she says was inherited from the previous Conservative administration. Reeves is expected to announce several tax rises to narrow the budget deficit, including a higher rate of capital gains tax and an increase in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions. Monica George Michail, an associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said the Bank of England was likely to view the stagnant economic situation and falling wages growth as a spur to cut rates further. She said Threadneedle Street policymakers would be cheered by a \u201cnotable fall\u201d in services sector pay growth, which fell to 3.6%, down from an average of 5.6% in the first half of this year. \u201cThis is positive news for inflation and might provide the Bank with increased confidence regarding interest rate cuts,\u201d she added. Earlier this month Bailey had suggested that the central bank could cut interest rates more aggressively if data showed the economy was slowing. Jake Finney, an economist at PwC UK, said: \u201cThe softening in demand for labour is starting to weigh on wage growth. A quarter-point cut in November still seems most likely, given signs that wage growth is moderating and increasingly dovish commentary from Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey.\u201d The trades union body, the TUC, said the fall in the unemployment rate disguised a worsening situation for young people. Youth unemployment rose to 12.8%, up 0.8 percentage points on the quarter. The number of young people in long-term unemployment has increased by 30,600 (or 53%) over the past year. The TUC general secretary, Paul Nowak, said: \u201cWe know that youth unemployment has terrible scarring effects on young people\u2019s life chances. This is not a problem we can allow to get any worse, and today\u2019s rise in long-term youth unemployment is particularly concerning.\u201d An ONS review of the number of people of working age who are not in the labour market found that the rate of inactivity declined to 21.8% in the June to August period, down 0.3 percentage points from the previous three months. The work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, said she was committed to doing more to help people back into jobs: \u201cMillions of people are locked out of work due to long-term sickness. This is not good for them, for our economy or for the taxpayer. \u201cThat\u2019s why we will bring forward the biggest reforms to employment support in a generation \u2013 overhauling jobcentres, delivering a youth guarantee so every young person is learning or earning, and new work, health and skills plans to tackle inactivity \u2013 unlocking opportunity and potential in every area of the country.\u201d"

            "content": "The latest unemployment rate should be met with cheers rather than gloom about it putting off a rate cut. We don\u2019t need higher unemployment to get a rate cut and both the government and the Reserve Bank should seize this opportunity to lock in historically low unemployment as the norm. I am by nature somewhat of a glass half-empty type. I mostly blame it on following sports teams which have a greater talent for disappointment than success. So it was peculiar last week that my immediate reaction to the latest unemployment figures was one of joy while the general response was gloom. In September, unemployment was a mere 4.1% while underemployment fell from 6.5% to 6.3%. This is absolutely good news. Historically good. Think of it like this: if you entered the labour force in October 1974, in your first 576 months of being in the labour force to January 2022, unemployment was below 4.2% just five times. In the 33 months since then it has been below 4.2% 32 times. If the graph does not display click here Right now a higher percent of adults are employed than ever before (records go back to 1966): If the graph does not display click here The surge in women working full-time means the share of all adults working full-time is as high as it has been since the 1990s recession: If the graph does not display click here We have had very strong migration over the past two years and yet unemployment is lower than anyone of working age has experienced, and more adults are working than ever before. That is astonishing. The underutilisation rate, which counts both unemployment and underemployment, is also lower now than it was before the pandemic: If the graph does not display click here That talk of a recession a few months ago seems distant \u2013 at least on the employment front. Is everything hunky dory? Of course not. The non-market sectors of education, healthcare and social assistance are contributing most of the increase hours worked, while employment growth in the \u201cmarket sector\u201d (ie those industries less reliant on government funding) is limp: If the graph does not display click here Partly this is an inevitable response after the unsustainable growth that occurred after the pandemic. But it also shows that raising interest rates 13 times does slow the economy. Ahh, I\u2019ve said it! Now we get to reason for the gloom \u2013 interest rates. The low unemployment rate means the likelihood of the next rate cut is further off than it was a month ago (or even just last week): If the graph does not display click here As someone fortunate enough to be paying off a mortgage, I would love a rate cut. As someone who is not a sociopath, I am not going to be sad if more people having a job means I\u2019ll have to wait a few more months before my mortgage repayments drop. The rates will inevitably come down \u2013 there is zero current prospect of them rising \u2013 and inflation is also down. Despite the Reserve Bank thinking the current level of unemployment is lower than it needs to be to stop inflation rising, inflation is falling. Importantly, (as Ross Gittins has also noted) the current level of unemployment is not like the mining-boom blip of early 2008 when the unemployment rate went below 4.2% for three months. It\u2019s been this low for nearly three years. This is not an aberration \u2013 it is the rule. And it should be the ceiling of what both governments and the Reserve Bank view as a standard level. The almost universal belief that the low unemployment level means no rate cut is actually rather weird given all this low unemployment has not brought with it any wages breakout. The most regular wage data we have is enterprise agreements lodged fortnightly with the Fair Work Commission. That data shows wage growth peaked a year ago: If the graph does not display click here But fears \u2013 real or otherwise \u2013 of inflation trump all right now. On Wednesday the IMF raised its predictions for inflation at the end of next year to 3.6% \u2013 surely another blow to a rate cut. But as Peter Hannam, who was one of the few to not lose his head, wrote, this was hardly news \u2013 the predictions just lined up with the most recent RBA estimates and are due to the energy rebate coming off. And while the IMF had increased its estimate for inflation from six months ago, the estimate for average inflation growth through the year is lower than was estimated 12 months ago: If the graph does not display click here Are we really going to sound the alarm because inflation is expected to average 3.3% next year? It really is time for people to calm down. Markets and commentators mostly responded to the low unemployment figures as proof that interest rates won\u2019t be cut because they just assume that low unemployment means stronger wages growth and higher inflation. But wages growth over the past two years has not risen at a pace that would prevent inflation being below 3%. This has not prevented those who lust for higher unemployment purely to satisfy their economic models wishing the RBA and government would do what they could to get unemployment up to 4.5%. For myself, I will continue to be happy that unemployment is low and instead worry that those with a job can get a decent wage rise and those looking for work can stop being forced to live in poverty. A rate cut? That would be nice, but much better news is that more Australians work now than ever before \u2013 and we should celebrate it. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

On an earnings call, Nadella said Microsoft\u2019s AI business was \u201con track to surpass an annual run-rate of $10bn next quarter, which will make it the fastest growing business in our history to reach this milestone\u201d. All eyes were on Azure, Microsoft\u2019s fastest-growing division, which has received billions of dollars of investment as the company focuses attention on artificial intelligence. Revenue from the division increased by 22%, according to a press release. A day earlier, Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, reported that its cloud business grew nearly 35% from a year earlier to $11.35bn, beating analyst estimates. Nadella said Azure now had 39,000 customers, up 80% year-over-year. The company now had AI data centers in over 60 regions around the world and Azure-OpenAI usage had more than doubled over the past six months, he added. Shares rose in after-hours trading. The company reported $3.30 earnings per share, against an anticipated $3.10 per share, on revenue of $65.59bn, against an anticipated $64.51bn. As it has invested in AI, Microsoft\u2019s financial expenditures have grown significantly. On Wednesday, its finance leases for data centers \u2013 essentially loans to pay for new assets over time \u2013 are over $108bn for leases that haven\u2019t started yet. Growing in parallel to its ballooning investments, Microsoft\u2019s demand for electricity has shot up in recent years. The company is looking to restart Three Mile Island, the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania famous for a partial meltdown in one of its reactors in 1979, as part of a project to power the tech giant\u2019s enormous fleet of data centers. Three Mile Island produced power until 2019, when it was shut down. Under the deal, Microsoft plans to purchase the plant\u2019s entire output of electricity over the next 20 years. But investors are growing wary of big tech\u2019s vast AI bet and hoping to receive a clearer picture of when the bet will begin to pay off. Between them, the seven companies \u2013 Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2013 represent $12tn in market capital and a whopping one-fifth of the S&amp;P 500, but the group has trailed the market for the past three months and have collectively fallen 3.5% in value since early July. The Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors that this was a \u201cgut-check quarter\u201d for Microsoft and Azure amid increasing competition in the AI ecosystem. \u201cOur checks for Microsoft have been solid this quarter as we continue to believe Redmond is in the driver\u2019s seat and accelerating cloud deal flow for Azure with strong momentum into 2025 and beyond,\u201d Ives wrote, referring to the location of Microsoft\u2019s headquarters in Washington state. \u201cWe maintain our \u2018outperform\u2019 rating.\u201d"

ByteDance said it had dismissed the person in August after they \u201cmaliciously interfered\u201d with the training of artificial intelligence (AI) models used in a research project. Thanks to the video-sharing app TikTok and its Chinese counterpart, Douyin, which rank among the world\u2019s most popular mobile apps, ByteDance has risen to become one of the world\u2019s most important social media companies. Like other big players in the tech sector, ByteDance has raced to embrace generative AI. Its Doubao chatbot earlier this year took over from the competitor Baidu\u2019s Ernie in the race to produce a Chinese rival to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. ByteDance has also released wireless earbuds that are integrated with Doubao, allowing users to interact with the chatbot directly without a mobile phone. The company commented on the sacking of the intern after rumours circulated widely on Chinese social media over the weekend. In a statement posted on its news aggregator service, Toutiao, ByteDance said that an intern in the commercial technology team had been dismissed for serious disciplinary violations, according to a translation. It added that its official commercial products and its large language models, the underlying technology for generative AI, had not been affected. The company said that reports and rumours on social media contained exaggerations, including over the scale of the disruption. ByteDance said this included rumours that as many as 8,000 graphical processing units, the chips used to train AI models, were affected, and that losses were in the tens of millions of dollars. ByteDance said that it had informed the intern\u2019s university and industry associations about their conduct. It comes amid scrutiny on tech companies around the world over the safety of generative AI models, and the effects of social media. ByteDance also faces particular scrutiny in the US, where it is fighting against a threatened federal ban. The company has until 19 January to sell its stake in TikTok to an approved buyer or close it. The US government contends that TikTok is a national security threat, an allegation ByteDance strongly disputes. ByteDance and TikTok were approached for comment."

Cathal Berry, now a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD, member of the Irish parliament), said he had not been surprised by a report at the weekend that the unnamed politician had been recruited \u201cas an agent of influence\u201d in a honeytrap operation. \u201cIf you are looking to affect a western country with extensive assets and a poor security culture then Ireland is ground zero,\u201d Berry told the Irish Times. \u201cHere the Russians get maximum impact for minimum effort. It is a playground for them.\u201d According to the report in the Irish Sunday Times, the aim of the operation was to build contact with loyalist paramilitaries at a time of sensitive discussions with the UK about whether there would be checks on the Irish border or not. The reported mission ties in with wider hybrid warfare efforts identified by the EU which it says can involve anything from disinformation to suspected arson and antisemitic attacks. \u201cRussia has written the manual on hybrid operations, misinformation, disinformation, cyber-attacks, anything that\u2019s deniable or that\u2019s very difficult to attribute to them,\u201d said Berry, a former second-in-command of the Irish Ranger Wing and now an independent TD for Kildare. According to the newspaper, the Irish military and security services identified the potential agent, code-named Cobalt, but he remains in office. There is no apparent evidence of him having being paid or having passed information to the Russians. He has not been arrested or charged. The opposition TD Richard Boyd Barrett has called for action by the authorities. \u201cI think anybody who has been corrupted by any external power rather than serving the interests of ordinary people has a serious case to answer,\u201d he said. The politician was said to have been recruited by Sergey Prokopiev, who worked in the embassy in Dublin from 2019-22, and was expelled two years ago after allegations he was an undeclared intelligence officer. On Sunday the taoiseach, Simon Harris, said he would not comment on matters of security but noted that Ireland was \u201cnot immune\u201d to Russian attempts to influence public discourse. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t come as any surprise to any of us that Russia seeks to influence public opinion, seeks to distort public opinion and is active in relation to that across the world and that Ireland is not immune from that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also seen a very significant increase in that level of activity since the brutal invasion by Russia of Ukraine.\u201d Asked whether he knew who the alleged agent was, Harris said he could not comment on security matters but that he was \u201csatisfied that our gardai and our intelligence services working internationally with counterparts take this issue very, very seriously\u201d. The Russian embassy said on Monday it had \u201calways believed that there is no sense or value in commenting\u201d on what it described as \u201cthe primitive anti-Russian concoctions\u201d in the Sunday Times. Russia\u2019s presence in Ireland has previously been the subject of concern, with planning permission to quadruple the size of the Russian embassy overturned by the government in 2020 due to concern over the new complex\u2019s purpose. At the time, Berry said the proposed complex, which would have included a subterranean network of 20 storage rooms, 10 power plant rooms and 13 toilets, looked more like a \u201cnerve centre\u201d for Russian intelligence."

            "date": "2024-10-23T21:30:36Z",
            "content": "Ministers have climbed down over plans to require the new football regulator to consider the government\u2019s foreign policy when making decisions about club takeovers. The move follows warnings from Uefa that this requirement could lead to some countries\u2019 bids for clubs being favoured over others and amount to political interference in football. The government will introduce the football governance bill in the House of Lords on Thursday. Setting up an independent regulator to oversee men\u2019s elite football in England was a Labour manifesto commitment, building on plans drawn up by the Conservatives in government. The bill drafted by the Tories stated the regulator\u2019s decisions on future or incumbent club owners should consider \u201cthe foreign and trade policy objectives\u201d of the UK government. This came under criticism from Uefa on the basis that it could mean special treatment for countries with which the UK has close trading and political links. England is due to co-host the 2028 European Championship with Scotland, Wales and Ireland but there were some fears this could be jeopardised by Uefa\u2019s concerns about the new regulator. Keir Starmer told reporters last month that he was in talks with Uefa to assuage its concerns. The prime minister suggested at the time that the proposals did not need to be changed and that the European football body had \u201cslightly reduced their concerns as time has gone on\u201d. In 2022 the Guardian revealed details of how Boris Johnson\u2019s government pressured the Premier League to approve the controversial takeover of Newcastle United by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund. Leaked messages published this month suggested that Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, was heavily involved in the takeover of the club. The Premier League insisted this week that it saw no reason to review the legality of the deal, which is controversial because of Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record. A CIA report concluded that Bin Salman approved the murder of the Washington Post journalist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in 2018. The crown prince has denied personal involvement. Proponents of the plan to require the regulator to consider foreign policy said it was intended to stop individuals who were sanctioned or barred from owning other UK assets from taking over clubs. There have been calls to go further and ban foreign ownership of English football clubs entirely. During the consultation period last year on the regulator\u2019s remit, some leading Premier League clubs lobbied the government to block nation states from taking control of teams in England. Newcastle\u2019s example has sparked debate while Manchester City, the reigning champions, have been owned since 2008 by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who is a key figure in the Abu Dhabi royal family and deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates. The regulator is intended to help monitor clubs\u2019 finances and improve fan engagement. It will require clubs to consult fans before changing ticket prices or relocating their home ground and have oversight over parachute payments, which are paid to clubs relegated from the Premier League. The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, is understood to have told the Premier League and its clubs that parachute payments will continue; the EFL wants them scrapped. Clubs will also need to set out what actions they are taking to improve equality, diversity and inclusion as part of a new governance code. Any club wanting to sell their stadium to related or third-party companies would need approval from the regulator, and such requests would be granted only if the club could demonstrate it was in their best long\u2011term interests, and had the backing of their fans. The new bill received a mixed response from the Premier League, which welcomed areas including fan engagement and encouraging responsible ownership but said it was concerned about \u201cunprecedented and untested powers to intervene in the distribution of the Premier League\u2019s revenues\u201d \u2013 a reference to the regulator\u2019s ability to enforce a settlement on extra funds going to the EFL and decide on the future of parachute payments. The Premier League said \u201crigid banking-style regulation\u201d could have \u201ca negative impact on the league\u2019s continued competitiveness, clubs\u2019 investment in world-class talent and, above all, the aspiration that drives our global appeal and growth\u201d It said it had provided \u00a31.6bn to the wider game and communities over the past three years. Rick Parry, the EFL chair, welcomed the bill, saying that the EFL will scrutinise \u201cthe key issue around the regulator\u2019s backstop powers in respect of financial redistribution\u201d while insisting that \u201cour intention is not to harm or hinder the strength of the Premier League\u201d. \u201cWith our clubs, we will continue to work with government and parliamentarians to consider appropriate checks and balances in the legislation to protect the hard-won position of English football, which is globally admired, a vital source of soft power and a driver of economic growth all over the country,\u201d the Premier League said. The Premier League has lobbied heavily on the bill, while also showering British MPs with hospitality in recent years. In the last parliament Starmer received more than \u00a335,000 worth of football tickets, many of which were for Premier League games. He also received more than \u00a312,000 in gifts and hospitality from the Premier League itself. Clive Betts, the Labour MP and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on football, told the Observer this month the gifts were \u201cclearly part of a campaign\u201d. He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think they can influence the regulator being set up, but they can influence what powers it has.\u201d Plans to establish the regulator were drawn up by the Conservatives following an attempt by several elite men\u2019s clubs to break away and form a European Super League. There have also been concerns about the financial mismanagement and collapse of smaller football clubs, including Bury and Macclesfield. Nandy said: \u201cEnglish football is one of our greatest exports and a source of national pride which this government wants to see thrive for generations to come. But for too long, financial instability has meant loyal fans and whole communities have risked losing their cherished clubs as a result of mismanagement and reckless spending. This bill seeks to properly redress the balance, putting fans back at the heart of the game, taking on rogue owners and crucially helping to put clubs up and down the country on a sound financial footing.\u201d Tracey Crouch, the former sports minister who first proposed the idea after a review of football governance, said: \u201dI\u2019m grateful the government is taking action to protect football from the threats of rogue owners and breakaway competitions. \u201cThe protections in the new bill reflect the fan-led review\u2019s recommendations that supporters should be placed back at the heart of the game and will have a genuine say on things like ticketing and club heritage.\u201d Gary Neville, the former Manchester United and England player, said: \u201cFootball is undoubtedly one of our country\u2019s greatest assets, but now more than ever we need an independent regulator to act as a guardian for our game, to make sure that clubs and their fans are protected for the long term.\u201d Meanwhile, supporters\u2019 groups from a number of top-flight clubs will stage protests at matches over the next fortnight in response to rising ticket prices. They will be backing the Football Supporters\u2019 Association\u2019s #StopExploitingLoyalty campaign. The actions, arranged over the next two weekends, are seen as a direct response to a range of ticket price rises and attacks on concessionary pricing bands at numerous clubs. Last weekend, fans of Spurs and West Ham protested over their clubs\u2019 withdrawals of concessionary rates before the match between the two. The FSA chair, Tom Greatrex, said: \u201cThe Premier League and its clubs really need to listen to this message \u2013 clubs must cherish and reward supporter loyalty rather than exploit it. \u201cFans feel clubs often care more about attracting one-off visitors who\u2019ll pay through the nose for a ticket while spending fortunes in the club shop, when they should be looking to reward those who go week in, week out, win or lose.\u201d Additional reporting by Kiran Stacey"

            "title": "Former foreign policy adviser to three UK PMs appointed as UN aid chief",
            "date": "2024-10-09T17:36:46Z",
            "content": "A former foreign policy adviser to three prime ministers including Gordon Brown has been appointed to the key post of UN coordinator for humanitarian affairs. Tom Fletcher is the latest in a line of six UN humanitarian chiefs from the UK. The most recent was Martin Griffiths, who stepped down in the summer. Fletcher\u2019s appointment is controversial because there has been a push from the Middle East and elsewhere for the post no longer to be monopolised by a British candidate, and that all such senior UN postings should be subject to open competition. More than 60 eminent diplomats and humanitarians wrote a letter to the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, in April saying that at a time of unprecedented humanitarian crises it would be \u201cquite wrong arbitrarily to restrict the search of a humanitarian coordinator to nationals of any one member state\u201d. Saudi Arabia and Qatar, two countries that supply large amounts of humanitarian aid, had put forward rival applications. Griffiths had also said the job is too crucial to be left to favouritism, and numerous UN resolutions have been passed calling for the appointments process to be made more transparent and more open to the global south. It is understood Guterres slowed the appointments process to prevent the Conservative government nominee, Tariq Ahmad, a former Middle East minister, being given the role. With Labour expected to win the election, he wanted to wait to give Keir Starmer a chance to make a nomination. Fletcher is seen as a gifted communicator with the diplomatic skills needed to intervene in conflicts that have triggered humanitarian crises from Gaza and Yemen to Myanmar, Sudan and Ukraine. The role is not only to raise humanitarian funds, but also to resolve the political conflicts that led to displacement and hunger. Brown sprung to Fletcher\u2019s defence, saying support for humanitarian aid needed to be radically extended to meet the emergencies engulfing more than 50 countries and affecting more than 100 million people. \u201cTom has huge diplomatic and leadership experience. He will bring creativity and resilience to this role,\u201d he said. Fletcher\u2019s appointment is particularly striking given that the UK\u2019s status as a development superpower with a large aid chequebook has been damaged by successive budget cuts that the Labour government is not expected to quickly overturn. Speaking after his appointment was confirmed by the UN in New York, Fletcher said: \u201cThe humanitarian community is underfunded, overstretched and under attack. We must reset the relationship between the world and those in direct need. We can be better neighbours and ancestors. \u201cI am grateful for the UN secretary general Guterres for giving me this opportunity to support that effort. I pay tribute to Martin Griffiths and to my future comrades in the humanitarian movement who are leading such vital work. I will defend humanitarians, humanitarian values and most importantly the people we are here to serve.\u201d His appointment is the first of a series that Starmer needs to make, including cabinet secretary, national security adviser and British ambassador to Washington. The ambassador posting is likely to be political with four candidates in the running: Tony Blair\u2019s former communications chief Peter Mandelson, the former foreign secretary David Miliband, the former international development secretary Valerie Amos, and the former EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton. Mandelson is also standing to be chancellor of Oxford University and has been told no prohibition exists on holding both jobs. The current UK ambassador to the UN, Barbara Woodward, is seen as a possible national security adviser along with the senior civil servant Olly Robbins and the former permanent secretary at the Home Office, Matthew Rycroft."

            "date": "2024-10-26T09:00:28Z",
            "content": "When Americans choose between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris next month, the decision will mark one of the most consequential elections for US foreign policy in generations that could ripple out into conflicts and redraw alliances around the world. With the candidates deadlocked in the final polls before election day, just tens of thousands of voters could decide whether world leaders next year face an American centrist in the vein of Joe Biden or a second term of office for one of the most disruptive US politicians of the last century. The elections come at a moment when foreign leaders have appealed for American leadership and diplomacy, as Israel fighting wars in Gaza and Lebanon risks spiraling into a full-scale regional conflict with Iran, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine faces further potential escalation with reports of North Korean troops being sent to the front lines, a civil war in Sudan rages on for a second year, and there are warnings of growing trade and military competition between the US and China. Trump\u2019s brand of America First politics has already sown instability among both partners and adversaries; Nato countries say that never before has the US been seen as the \u201cunpredictable ally\u201d, a country where instability around the elections is the norm and the alliance\u2019s long-term plans must be \u201cTrump-proofed\u201d. Ahead of the elections, European diplomats in Washington have expressed dismay with the Biden administration\u2019s cautious foreign policy, especially in relation to Ukraine and the White House\u2019s failed efforts to conclude a ceasefire in Gaza, while also steeling themselves for the very real potential for a Trump victory and the instability that would inject into world politics. \u201cI can\u2019t say for sure whether [Trump] would seek a deal with Putin on day one or whether he would drop a nuclear bomb on Moscow,\u201d one European ambassador said about Trump. \u201cThe truth is that it\u2019s a black box and that anyone who tells you that they know what\u2019s going on inside [his] administration is lying.\u201d Last month, Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived in Washington to vastly different receptions. At the White House he received a warm greeting in public, but privately officials responded skeptically to his \u201cvictory plan\u201d against the Russian invasion and refused to grant his request to use US-made missiles to strike targets deep inside of Russia. Then he met Donald Trump, who sought to humiliate Zelenskyy as he met him at Trump Tower in a hastily-arranged summit at the tail end of a visit to the United Nations. \u201cWe have a very good relationship,\u201d Trump said as Zelenskyy looked on stoically. \u201cAnd I also have a very good relationship \u2013 as you know \u2013 with President Putin. And I think if we win, I think we\u2019re going to get it resolved very quickly.\u201d \u201cIt takes two to tango, you know,\u201d Trump added. Meanwhile, diplomats from around the world continue to sit down with Trump and foreign policy thinkers rumoured to be tapped for his team, including with the authors of policy briefs from conservative think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation or the Trump-adjacent America First Policy Institute. \u201cCountries around the world are hedging and they have to be prepared for either outcome,\u201d said Andrew Weiss, vice-president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former director for Russian, Ukrainian and Eurasian Affairs on the national security council staff. \u201cThe Washington professional foreign policy establishment look at the possibility of Trump\u2019s return with great alarm. People know how chaotic his time in office was. They saw various foreign leaders wrap then President Trump around their finger. They saw how vulnerable and susceptible he was to calculations about personal self-interest and self-dealing, and how disinterested he was in preserving our alliances.\u201d A popular parlor game in Washington has been to predict who Trump could choose for his cabinet amongst a dwindling set of foreign policy experts still willing to work with him. Within the Republican party, there is a broader split between two camps supporting Trump: those who think that US should embrace a muscular, hawkish foreign policy traditional to Republicans, and those who believe that the US should occupy a more isolationist position. \u201cWe are not going to be the world\u2019s policeman,\u201d said Elbridge Colby, a deputy assistant secretary of defense during the first Trump administration, in an interview this week with the New York Times. \u201cWe have to understand that, because for the first time in more than a century, we are not clearly the world\u2019s largest economy. And we\u2019re definitely not the world\u2019s largest industrial power.\u201d With Israel expanding its war into Lebanon in the weeks before the election, there is considerable doubt that the White House under Harris or Trump will be prepared to meaningfully rein in Benjamin Netanyahu and find a diplomatic solution to the conflict. \u201cI think America is weak,\u201d said Yossi Melman, an Israeli journalist who specialises in security affairs, and is co-author of Spies Against Armageddon: Inside Israel\u2019s Secret Wars. \u201cAmerica is losing its influence.\u201d Washington under Biden was unable to compel either Iran or Israel to the table, he said. A Trump presidency would be \u201cextremely unpredictable\u201d, he added, but although Trump had suggested he would allow Israel to \u201cfinish what they started\u201d, his own troubled relationship with Netanyahu could interfere. \u201cHis record is not very pro-Israeli in the Netanyahu sense,\u201d said Melman. \u201cI\u2019m not ruling out that if [Trump] is a player, then he would just say: \u2018Fuck off.\u2019\u201d At the same time, there is considerable skepticism that a Harris administration would meaningfully alter Biden\u2019s policy of support for Israel even while attempting to broker a ceasefire. The vice-president has spoken out more forcefully on her sympathy for the plight of Palestinians, but at the same time she has rejected a potential arms embargo against Israel that could be used to put diplomatic pressure on the Netanyahu administration. \u201cIf Trump is elected, Netanyahu\u2019s margin for maneuver will expand,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, focusing on US foreign policy in the Middle East. \u201cIf Harris wins. I don\u2019t see much of a change in US policy anywhere\u2026 it\u2019s hard to imagine, unless there are ready made opportunities, not just crises, that you know she\u2019s going to be prepared to wade in any in a way that\u2019s different than Biden.\u201d It\u2019s a pattern that has repeated itself with the US relationship with Israel for decades now. Miller recalled when Barack Obama entered office in 2009 that he was told by an official that this time was \u201cgoing to be different.\u201d \u201cThis person said, you\u2019ll see, particularly with Israel, he\u2019s not going to deal with Netanyahu the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see it\u2019ll be tougher. It\u2019ll be stronger. None of it happened and I doubt any of it\u2019s going to happen now.\u201d As those conflicts rage on, a number of prominent Republicans have called for the US to refocus its attention toward China, with some saying Trump should divert resources from the conflicts both in Russia and in the Middle East toward controlling China\u2019s rise. \u201cThe existential threats to America, to our existence, to our kids, how they live, to our grandkids, come from one place. It\u2019s the Chinese Communist party in Beijing. It\u2019s Xi Jinping and his ambitions,\u201d said Robert O\u2019Brien, Trump\u2019s former national security advisor who is said to be seeking a position in a potential Trump administration. Some foreign officials have said that the potential for pedigreed officials such as O\u2019Brien to return to a potential Trump administration could help control his unpredictability. But new reporting has suggested that Trump has been freelancing his own foreign policy, carrying on private conversations with foreign leaders such as Putin in the years when he was out of the Oval Office. The Wall Street Journal this week reported that Elon Musk, a prominent Trump surrogate who has become his largest donor, has been in \u201cregular contact\u201d with Putin since late 2022. At one point, Putin reportedly asked Musk not to turn on his Starlink satellite network over Taiwan as a personal favour to Xi Jinping. Both men have denied the reports. Taken together, it suggests that Trump\u2019s policies in a potential administration may largely be shaped by just the candidate himself. \u201cTrump has taken positions on nearly all foreign policy issues that are really heterodox and run counter to decades of bipartisan US foreign policy expectations,\u201d said Weiss. \u201cSo if Trump comes back, the general expectation is that the quality of his leadership is going to be more chaotic and more disruptive than it was eight years ago. Because he seems bent on being his real self, as opposed to the version that was hemmed in by traditionalists when he came into office.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-25T17:30:08Z",
            "content": "This spring Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, warned bluntly that Europe should prepare itself for potential war: \u201cMaybe, depending on who is ruling in Washington, we cannot rely on the American support and on the American capacity to protect us,\u201d he said. Weeks earlier, Donald Trump had remarked that he would encourage Russia to attack Nato countries who paid too little. Japanese defence spending has soared. In South Korea, there are growing calls for an independent nuclear deterrent. America\u2019s allies are nervous as they contemplate next month\u2019s election. Autocrats, upon whom Mr Trump lavishes praise, are hopeful. The votes of tens of thousands of Americans in battleground states are likely to prove profoundly consequential for the rest of the world. The assumption is that a Trump victory would be felt first and hardest by Ukraine. Whatever his precise relationship with Vladimir Putin, with its cosy phone calls, the former president\u2019s sympathies are clear. He blamed Volodymyr Zelenskyy for starting the war with Russia. Mr Trump\u2019s running mate, JD Vance, has urged an immediate end to assistance. On the Middle East, Kamala Harris has been more sympathetic to Palestinians and critical of Israel than Joe Biden, but there is no sign yet that she differs on policy. The dramatic erosion of Arab American support does not appear to have prompted a long\u2011overdue reconsideration of arms shipments to Israel. Yet Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is thought to eagerly anticipate the return of a president who rewarded and encouraged the Israeli right. Mr Trump pulled out of the Iranian nuclear deal, with which Tehran was complying \u2013 though at least his aversion to \u201cendless wars\u201d held him back from a strike on Iran. Would that hold now? Mr Trump\u2019s presidency made the world more dangerous. Since his blustering mishandling of Kim Jong-un, North Korea has accelerated its nuclear programme and moved closer to China and Russia. The Biden administration did not reject all aspects of Mr Trump\u2019s tenure. Hawkishness on China is one of the few bipartisan issues left. But the White House\u2019s targeted approach is in contrast to Mr Trump\u2019s crude economic nationalism \u2013 threatening 60% tariffs on Chinese products and up to 20% on all imports \u2013 which could spark a global trade war. He initially wooed Taiwan, but now says it should pay the US for its defence. That reflects a nakedly short-termist, transactional approach to foreign policy \u2013 with domestic political needs the priority. The Democrats \u2013 and Ms Harris \u2013 have tacked right on immigration, but Mr Trump has snatched infants from their parents and now promises mass deportations. His fascistic language about immigrants \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of America legitimised and spread racism. He has emboldened misogynists, the far right and strongmen internationally. Ms Harris is not thought to be as emotionally attached to Israel or Europe as her boss, nor to share his vision of a civilisational clash between democracies and their foes. She says she would \u201cstand strong\u201d with Ukraine, but might be somewhat more inclined than Mr Biden to push for a deal with Russia. While most expect there would be broad continuity, it is impossible to predict exactly what a candidate will do once in office. We can be sure, however, that while Ms Harris would not always get it right on foreign policy, she would bring stability, responsibility and dedication \u2013 in contrast to Mr Trump\u2019s reckless, erratic, fact-free and narcissistic approach. And while climate action under her would still fall short of what is needed, her rival would deliberately wreck existing global accords. For all these reasons, the world cannot afford a second Trump administration. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "date": "2024-10-16T23:00:08Z",
            "content": "British doctors of BAME origin and overseas-trained medics working in the UK experience \u201cpersistent and pernicious\u201d inequality throughout their careers, the medical regulator has warned. The General Medical Council (GMC) said too many doctors are still being reported by their employers for alleged misconduct compared with white British-trained medics. Doctors also experience \u201cdiscrimination and disadvantage\u201d in their efforts to progress medical careers because of a hostile \u201cculture\u201d in too many parts of the NHS, it said. The report, by the GMC\u2019s chief executive, Charlie Massey, is intended to stamp out discrimination. In his foreword, Massey points out that the makeup of the medical workforce across the UK is changing. More than half of all the doctors who joined the GMC\u2019s register last year were trained overseas \u2013 international medical graduates (IMGs) \u2013 and \u201cthe demography of UK graduates is also increasingly diverse\u201d. But, he said: \u201cYet, for too many doctors, medicine is a story of discrimination and disadvantage. From the early days of education and training, to the leadership positions of latter years, issues of inequality are persistent and pernicious. \u201cThis unfairness is deep-rooted and longstanding. It undermines doctors\u2019 morale and ability to perform at their best. And it shames our health services. \u201cFair treatment is not the preserve of a select few \u2013 it is the right of all doctors, regardless of who they are.\u201d The report provides a detailed update on the targets the GMC set in 2021 to tackle \u201cpersistent areas of inequality\u201d. It set them in response to persistent criticism of the disproportionate number of UK-trained BAME doctors and overseas-trained medics who were being referred to it for alleged breaches of their code of conduct. Progress against those targets has been made, the report finds. For instance, the number of bodies such as NHS trusts or health boards across the UK found to have referred a disproportionate number of doctors to the GMC for investigation, based on their ethnicity or place they qualified, has fallen from 5.6% to 3.2% from 2016 to 2023. Similarly, the difference in rates of employers\u2019 referral of medics to the GMC between ethnic minority and white doctors fell from 0.28% to 0.13% between 2016 and last year. As well as the \u201csustained signs of improvement\u201d in such referrals, the \u201cattainment gap\u201d in how IMGs fare in their careers when they start training in their chosen medical speciality is also \u201cnarrowing\u201d. Massey told the Guardian that too many \u201ccultures within which doctors work are not inclusive enough\u201d, especially given the NHS\u2019s increasingly diverse medical workforce. The enduring gaps between white doctors and their British BAME counterparts and IMGs are \u201cshaming\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d, he added. However, he lauded the efforts of some NHS employers, such as the Hywel Dda health board in Wales, to help IMGs in particular settle in the UK through support with finding homes and schools, and at work through tailored induction programmes. Massey urged more NHS bodies to learn from such examples and avoid the situation where a doctor newly arrived in the UK is \u201cthrown on to\u201d a medical rota with little preparation. The British Medical Association urged the NHS to move quicker to end discrimination and make UK medicine a more welcoming and inclusive environment for doctors who are not white. Prof Philip Banfield, the BMA\u2019s chair of council, said: \u201cThe GMC recognises, in its own words, the \u2018persistent and pernicious\u2019 inequality that ethnic minority doctors and our colleagues from overseas are still forced to endure over the course of their entire careers. \u201cWhile there may be signs of progress in some areas, we will not be satisfied until doctors of all backgrounds are afforded the same opportunities, free from discrimination, and treated with equal respect and fairness.\u201d He added: \u201cThis must extend throughout their training and career development, be reflected in everyday interactions in their workplace with colleagues and patients, and in the very way the GMC conducts itself and treats doctors undergoing fitness-to-practise proceedings.\u201d The \u201cdisparities\u201d disclosed in the GMC\u2019s report are unacceptable, the Department of Health and Social Care said. \u201cWe are proud the NHS is one of the most diverse organisations in this country but these disparities in career paths are clearly unacceptable. This report shows that while progress is being made it is vital we go further and faster to address these inequalities,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cAs we fix the broken NHS and deliver our 10-year plan for health we will seek to close these gaps. We are committed to supporting NHS England\u2019s Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Improvement Plan, which sets out targeted actions to address the prejudice and discrimination \u2013 direct or indirect \u2013 faced by healthcare professionals.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-28T09:00:25Z",
            "content": "People who go to one of the UK\u2019s main customer complaints bodies for help are being \u201cmisled\u201d about their chances of success because it is inflating the number of cases upheld in favour of consumers, an academic study claims. Researchers from Warwick University say they have uncovered \u201csome very concerning practices\u201d at the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) relating to how it handles complaints, and that the \u201cgenuine\u201d customer success rate is a lot lower than the published figure. But the FOS has hit back, saying it \u201cstrongly refutes the claims\u201d and \u201cdoes not recognise the findings\u201d. The FOS was set up by parliament in 2001 and is the main complaints-handling body for people who have a problem with a financial product or service \u2013 from bank accounts, mortgages and insurance, to loans, investments and pensions. Each year more than a million people contact the FOS for help. However, it has previously come in for criticism and currently has a rating on reviews website Trustpilot of 1.3 out of five, based on more than 1,700 reviews, which the site says is a \u201cbad\u201d score. The research focuses on cases upheld in favour of the consumer. The FOS website says that, in 2023-24, across all products, it upheld 37% of the complaints it was asked to resolve. However, researchers claim that, with many of those they looked at, the FOS sided with the business, rejected the substance of the individual\u2019s complaint, and noted they would be disappointed with the finding, \u201cwith a sudden pivot to recording the judgment as an \u2018uphold\u2019 at the end\u201d. Researchers claim their analysis suggests that, rather than the advertised 37% figure, the \u201cgenuine\u201d rate for upheld cases for 2023-24 was 24%, and considerably lower than that for some individual ombudsmen. They examined a random sample of complaints classified as \u201cupheld\u201d between 1 May 2022 and 30 April 2023, and agree that two-thirds were genuinely upheld, but that, in their view, the remaining third were problematic. They say that with these, the ombudsman essentially rejected the complaint and the customer\u2019s claim for compensation, and ruled that either there would be no additional redress beyond that already offered or paid, or that just a \u201ctoken\u201d amount for distress or inconvenience, should be awarded. \u201cIn such cases it is also often noted by the ombudsman that the complainant will be dissatisfied with the result, even though it is recorded as upheld,\u201d says the study, adding: \u201cConsumers are being misled about their chances of a substantive finding in their favour.\u201d It adds that the distress and inconvenience awards are often a lot smaller \u2013 typically between \u00a350 and \u00a3300 \u2013 than the thousands that some people were seeking. The study gives the example of \u201cMs B,\u201d who complained that her insurer had unfairly withdrawn its offer to make a payout under her home insurance policy. She took legal action after suffering an injury while having a beauty treatment. Her insurer initially said her policy would cover her claim if all else failed \u2013 but it later said it had made a mistake and that the claim did not meet the requirements of the relevant section of the policy. The insurer offered her \u00a3100 compensation. However, Ms B argued it had made \u201ca negligent misrepresentation\u201d and, as a result, she had suffered \u201csevere monetary loss\u201d. She went to the FOS, but its investigator did not uphold her complaint as they were satisfied the compensation was fair. Ms B disputed this, so it was escalated to an ombudsman. But it ruled the claim did not fall within the policy cover and the insurer had made an error. It ruled the offer of \u00a3100 was fair and said it was all Ms B should get. Despite all that, and with Ms B presumably very unhappy with the final verdict, the complaint is officially recorded on the FOS system as \u201cupheld\u201d. Researchers say their findings were \u201cconcerning with regard to the credibility\u201d of the reported uphold rate at the FOS, which is funded by the financial services industry, and they speculated on whether there was any \u201ctop-down institutional pressure to inflate the uphold rate\u201d. In response, the FOS says it does not recognise the findings, adding that during the year the study looked at, more than 85% of its cases \u2013 tens of thousands \u2013 were investigated and resolved informally by investigators who issued \u201cviews\u201d to the parties involved that did not appear on its website. The FOS says it is wrong to suggest that because a compensation award was similar to, or only slightly more than, the one offered by the business, the complaint should not be classed as an uphold. A small amount of extra redress could make a big difference in some cases, and not all complainants are seeking money, it adds. It also says it does not award people a small amount of redress and then class this as an \u201cupheld\u201d case \u2013 it is the other way around. It adds: \u201cWe strongly refute the claims made by this research which looked at just 99 cases \u2013 less than 0.5% of our annual caseload \u2013 and fails to recognise that an answer from our service provides clarity to both consumers and businesses. \u201cEach year the FOS helps thousands of people settle disputes with businesses, awarding millions of pounds back in redress and compensation \u2026 While not everyone will agree with our findings, we are committed to providing answers which are fair and reasonable.\u201d \u2022 The Warwick University researchers are looking to do a more detailed analysis of FOS cases and complainants\u2019 experiences. Those interested in potentially taking part can email FOS@warwick.ac.uk Regulator\u2019s caseload rockets There\u2019s been a huge surge in complaints from unhappy consumers about financial products and services, fuelled by a relentless rise in the number of people hit by scams. Most recent data, from 1 April to 30 June this year, shows a 70% jump in complaints received by the Financial Ombudsman Service, compared with the same period last year. During just those three months, it received 74,645 new complaints. Credit cards are the most complained-about category. Most cases taken to the FOS during this period involved irresponsible or unaffordable lending claims. The second most complained-about product is motor finance, including personal contract purchase (PCP) and hire purchase. It has previously been claimed that millions of drivers could be in line for a payout if an official investigation rules that consumers have been unfairly charged inflated prices. Other products attracting a lot of complaints include current accounts and vehicle insurance. At the same time, fraud and scam complaints have hit their \u201chighest-ever level\u201d, says the FOS. More than half involve \u201cauthorised push payment scams\u201d tricking people into sending money to bank accounts operated by criminals. On top of that, buildings insurance complaints have hit a 10-year high, fuelled by storm and flood damage."

The journalists\u2019 union Somali Journalists Syndicate (SJS) said the detention of Abduqadir Mohamed Nur was a \u201cbrazen attack\u201d on the reporter and his news outlet, Risaala Media Corporation, for critical reporting of state security forces. Abdalle Ahmed Mumin, the union\u2019s secretary general, called for the National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA) to release Nur, who SJS said was taken to a detention facility known for torture. Mumin said: \u201cWe demand an independent investigation into the circumstances of this illegal act, holding those responsible accountable for violating the rights of journalists and the principles of justice.\u201d The head of Risaala Media Corporation, Mohamed Abduwahab, said he condemned \u201cthe abduction and unlawful actions\u201d against Nur, who is known as \u201cJakarta\u201d. SJS said Risaala and Nur\u2019s family had reported armed men arriving at his house at 3am on Friday to detain him and confiscate his phone and laptop. It said that this followed the arrest of other Risaala employees, who have reported critically on the security forces under President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. The arrest threatened the press and the public\u2019s access to independent reporting, it said. The Guardian reported that the journalist AliNur Salaad had been arrested in July after similar reporting on the security forces and there have been several claims of attacks on press freedom since. In August, SJS criticised attacks on journalists covering protests in Mogadishu over the cost of living. It also reported the disappearance of the journalist Ali Mohammed Ahmed (known as Ali Shujac) after he was taken away by plainclothes police officers while conducting public interviews. In July, the journalist Said Abdullahi Kulmiye was arrested for reporting on incidents of police and armed men demanding bribes at checkpoints, while the journalists Sharma\u2019arke Abdi Mahdi and Abdinur Hayi Hashi said they were shot at by four police officers in the town of Dhobley in May. The World Press Freedom Index ranks Somalia 145th out of 180 countries for journalists\u2019 ability to report freely and independently. Aside from attacks on journalists, press freedom groups have argued against a proposed information law, which the government says is designed to reduce leaks and improve the confidentiality of sources. Campaigners say it would reduce the ability of journalists to investigate and report on matters of public interest. \u201cThis could easily be misused to shield government activities from scrutiny, eroding the fundamental right to information and enabling potential abuses of power,\u201d said a letter from regional and international press freedom campaigners, including the International Federation of Journalists."

            "title": "Labour could cut financial support for farms damaged by floods",
            "date": "2024-10-05T06:00:16Z",
            "content": "Labour may cut financial support for flooded farmers, the Guardian has learned, while money to compensate them for deluges in January has still not hit their pockets. The previous Conservative government earlier this year promised up to \u00a325,000 in payments for uninsurable damage from flooding caused by Storm Henk. However, the eligibility criteria for these grants have still not been set out, leaving farmers out of pocket. The scheme has been plagued with delays, with some affected farmers not being paid because they live too far from a river. Some early claimants received money in July but thousands more who are thought to be eligible are still waiting for the financial support. Senior sources in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told the Guardian that decisions about how much money could be paid to farmers for the floods were being held up because of the spending review, and that cuts were on the table. The Conservatives had promised a \u00a350m expansion of the fund before the general election. Floods have already begun this autumn, with freshly sown crops washed away and farmers facing another unprofitable harvest season. Farmers fear that they are about to take a financial hit while still waiting for government payments from January\u2019s floods. New Met Office data shows six counties had their wettest September on record: Bedfordshire, Oxfordshire, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire. There have been floods across the country and more rain is expected by the end of this week. The National Farmers\u2019 Union vice-president, Rachel Hallos, said: \u201cBack in May, farmers impacted by the devastating storms at the start of the year were promised help through the expanded farming recovery fund offer, but this has not been forthcoming. \u201cMonths later, farm businesses are still suffering the impact of the relentless rain. Thousands of acres of farmland have been completely saturated and unusable, and we\u2019ve just finished an incredibly difficult harvest with huge variations in yield and quality. We urgently need details of when the fund will be available to help these farms recover. \u201cWith further heavy rain leaving more fields waterlogged, arable farmers are once again concerned about getting crops in the ground for next season. We cannot keep getting stuck in this cycle \u2013 we simply must invest in our water management systems. The farming recovery fund is one part, but we need a long-term plan for how we protect our towns and countryside from what is becoming more regular, and expensive, flooding events.\u201d This is the latest blow to farmer confidence from the Labour government, after the Guardian revealed ministers were mulling cutting about \u00a3100m a year from the nature-friendly farming budget. Flooding is hurting UK food security, and experts believe floods are being made worse by climate breakdown. Income from farming in England plummeted by 19% in 2023 after floods meant harvesting many crops was impossible. Farms also contributed less to England\u2019s economy in 2023 at \u00a310bn, a fall of \u00a31bn or 8.7% compared with 2022. Farmers\u2019 total income from agriculture in England was \u00a34.5bn, down \u00a31.1bn or 19.0% compared with 2022. A Defra spokesperson said that all spending commitments for the coming year were to be confirmed in the spending review, adding: \u201cThe government is working at pace, with input from representatives of the farming sector, to accelerate the building of flood defences through our new flood resilience taskforce. All farmers eligible for the initial farm recovery fund set up in April have been offered payment, with further information on the scheme set out in due course.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-02T14:51:15Z",
            "content": "Starling Bank has been fined \u00a329m by the City watchdog for \u201cshockingly lax\u201d financial crime controls that \u201cleft the financial system wide open to criminals and those subject to sanctions\u201d. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said Starling, one of the UK\u2019s most popular challenger banks, had expanded quickly but \u201cmeasures to tackle financial crime did not keep pace with its growth\u201d. The online bank, founded in 2014 by the entrepreneur Anne Boden and backed by Goldman Sachs, has grown rapidly from 43,000 customers in 2017 to 3.6 million in 2023. Banks are required by law to conduct rigorous checks on new customers to prevent fraud and money laundering, but the FCA\u2019s review of financial crime controls at challenger banks in 2021 identified serious concerns with the anti-money laundering and sanctions framework at Starling. The bank had agreed to a requirement restricting it from opening new accounts for high-risk customers until this improved, but failed to comply and opened more than 54,000 accounts for 49,183 high-risk customers between September 2021 and November 2023, the FCA said. Starling earned \u00a3900,000 in interest and fees from them. In January 2023, the bank became aware that its automated screening system had, since 2017, only been screening customers against a fraction of the full list of those subject to financial sanctions. An internal review found systemic issues in its financial sanctions framework, and the bank has since reported multiple potential breaches of financial sanctions to the relevant authorities. Therese Chambers, an executive director at the FCA, said: \u201cStarling\u2019s financial sanction screening controls were shockingly lax. It left the financial system wide open to criminals and those subject to sanctions. It compounded this by failing to properly comply with FCA requirements it had agreed to, which were put in place to lower the risk of Starling facilitating financial crime.\u201d Starling said it \u201cregrets and apologises\u201d for its failings, and has paid the fine as a full and final settlement. It added that it had rescreened transactions and reviewed its customer accounts in depth, and introduced additional safeguards. David Sproul, the bank\u2019s chair, said: \u201cI would like to apologise for the failings outlined by the FCA and to provide reassurance that we have invested heavily to put things right, including strengthening our board governance and capabilities.\u201d The FCA found that Starling\u2019s financial crime risk control had not been updated correctly, resulting in 294 customers that had previously been ditched by the bank for financial crime reasons opening new accounts. Of these customers, 161 had been previously subject to a suspicious activity report, which alerts the authorities to potential instances of money laundering or terrorist financing, and 112 customers had either a full or partial match on the fraud prevention service Cifas. The bank did not screen its customers against sanctions records for individuals from other countries, including the US, despite payments being made in dollars. A raft of sanctions have been imposed by the UK, US and EU against various Russians since Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. However, Starling\u2019s customers or prospective clients were only screened against sanctions records for individuals with UK citizenship or residency \u2013 accounting for 39 of the 3,088 people on the UK sanctions list. This meant there was a \u201cmaterial risk\u201d that Russians on the list would have been able to open or maintain accounts. Starling found that at least one person on the sanctions list had opened an account with the bank. Starling took on an average of 15,000 new business customers a month during the Covid crisis. The bank was in 2022 accused by the former minister Theodore Agnew of failing to properly review borrowers before handing out taxpayer-backed loans. Boden rejected the comments and said she was \u201cshocked\u201d by them. Starling\u2019s founder stepped down as chief executive in May last year in a surprise move, to shield the online bank from potential concerns over a conflict of interest because she was a major shareholder. She quit as a non-executive director in June to run her venture AI by Boden but retains a stake of less than 5% in Starling. The bank has talked about its intention to float on the stock market, but Boden said last year that plans had been paused amid depressed interest in the financial markets. The fine would have been nearly \u00a341m but the FCA said that, as Starling had \u201cagreed to resolve these matters\u201d, it qualified for a 30% discount under its processes."

Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel directed his 19-minute monologue on Tuesday at Republicans. \u201cWe are very divided,\u201d he said, and not just because of Donald Trump. \u201cBecause of people like, if I\u2019m being honest, me. I do a lot of mocking and belittling, and it isn\u2019t always productive. Am I biased against Donald Trump? Yes. Do I think I have good reasons for being biased against him? Yes. And I think when you hear some of those reasons, you might agree with me, even just a little bit.\u201d Kimmel spoke to \u201copen-minded\u201d voters who, he assumed, were shown the monologue by a concerned loved one. \u201cMost Americans, and you are probably one of them, don\u2019t have time to watch his rallies and his speeches and all the interviews, because you have other things to do,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have other things to do. This is all I have to do. And because I don\u2019t have other things to do, I have seen all or at least part of every interview, every speech, every all-caps social media post from this man in the past nine years.\u201d Kimmel said he wasn\u2019t going to rehash the old stuff \u2013 the \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d comment, etc \u2013 but just the \u201cwords that have come of his mouth\u201d since he has been running for president. He started with Obamacare, which Trump has, since 2016, said he would abolish without ever specifying his replacement plan. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t seen a plan for healthcare!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cIf someone who works for you, let\u2019s say it\u2019s your barber, promises to present you with a plan for trimming your hair over and over again for nine years and never does, you\u2019d probably fire that person.\u201d From healthcare to childcare to how to handle inflation, \u201che doesn\u2019t even try to answer. He just tap dances.\u201d Kimmel also shot down Trump\u2019s fearmongering about \u201csex changes\u201d at elementary schools. \u201cThis is a lie. You have to know this. You do know this \u2013 this is not real,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president should be focused on things that are actually things. There are so many difficult problems that need to be solved, and this guy keeps focusing on windmills. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda funny, these silly random rants of his,\u201d he continued, \u201cand they would be fine if he was hosting a podcast or selling knives at the farmer\u2019s market, but he\u2019s supposed to be leading us. People are listening to him. And the country is getting crazier because he makes it OK to be nuts.\u201d Calling Trump \u201cthe exact meeting point between Q-Anon and QVC\u201d, he also mocked the former president for selling branded products, such as Trump Bibles. \u201cHow does this not bother anyone? How is this not embarrassing? \u201cHe has no plan to lower grocery prices, or to make us safer, or to protect the border,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only plan he has is to file lawsuits, legal challenges, settle scores and punish his enemies. \u201cMost elections are about policy. This one is not. This is about sanity, security and democracy,\u201d he concluded. \u201cI saw a shirt the other day, it said, \u2018I support Trump because he pisses off the people who piss me off.\u2019\u201d Kimmel got it \u2013 \u201csometimes it feels like we don\u2019t have a sense of humor any more,\u201d he noted. \u201cBut is that really all we want for America? To piss each other off? I don\u2019t want that.\u201d Stephen Colbert \u201cIn just seven days, we will finally, probably still not know who won,\u201d said Stephen Colbert on The Late Show, with less than a week until \u201cAmericans try to decide between an expanded child tax credit, and the 10,000-year reich of Hamburglar Himmler.\u201d Colbert focused on the fallout from Trump\u2019s rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, in which the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe referred to Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating pile of garbage\u201d. \u201cHere\u2019s a little pro tip: when running for president, try not to October surprise yourself,\u201d said Colbert. \u201cIt\u2019s rare to tell a joke so bad that it alters the course of human history. The last time that happened was in 1914, when Archduke Franz Ferdinand said at an open mic, \u2018Serbian assassins are so ugly, their portraits hang themselves! Haha that joke killed \u2026 me! Uh-oh, world war one is starting.\u2019\u201d On Tuesday, Trump \u201cstepped up like a man and took responsibility for absolutely nothing\u201d. Speaking of Hinchcliffe, Trump claimed: \u201cI don\u2019t know him, someone put him up there. I don\u2019t know who he is \u2026\u201d As part of his damage control, Trump then posted a video of a Cuban band singing about their support for him. \u201cOK, to be fair, he may not realize that those aren\u2019t the same place,\u201d Colbert laughed. Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers reported that Trump said during his Sunday rally, \u201cthere\u2019s no place like Madison Square Garden.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s right. Very few NBA arenas could go over 50 years without seeing a championship,\u201d Meyers joked, referring to the New York Knicks. In an interview, JD Vance declined to call the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, an enemy and instead called him an \u201cadversary\u201d. \u201cWell, that makes sense. A lot of people have an adversarial relationship with their boss,\u201d Meyers quipped. At a Harris campaign event this past weekend in Pittsburgh, Biden said Elon Musk was an \u201cillegal worker\u201d when he first came to the US from South Africa (via Canada). \u201cOh, come on, that\u2019s not fair. He was never a worker,\u201d said Meyers. And the embattled New York City mayor, Eric Adams, denied claims that Trump was a fascist, and argued that \u201cwe can all dial down the temperature\u201d. \u201cWhich serves as a reminder that no matter who wins on November 5, Mayor Adams is going to need a pardon,\u201d Meyers joked."

            "date": "2024-10-01T13:00:09Z",
            "content": "Guardian perfectionist Felicity Cloake can often be found scaling recipes when testing for her column: \u201cWhen you\u2019re making six or seven versions of the same thing, sometimes you have to for your own sanity.\u201d Generally speaking, it\u2019s an easy thing to do, too, says Helen Goh, co-author of Ottolenghi Comfort \u2013 \u201cassuming you didn\u2019t fail maths, or you have a calculator.\u201d But success really depends on what you\u2019re making, of course. \u201cIn baking, for instance, trying to cream a small amount of butter and sugar in a mixer will have the beaters going round and round without making a jot of difference,\u201d Goh says. Pasta sauces, meanwhile, are \u201cfair game\u201d in Cloake\u2019s book, as are most stews and soups. That\u2019s not to say you can simply double the ingredients and be done with it, mind. \u201cSeasoning such as salt, pepper, spices and lemon juice don\u2019t always scale up or down in a neat way,\u201d Goh explains, so her trick is to add them in increments, tasting and adjusting accordingly. Next, consider how the volume of ingredients in the original recipe will impact on the cooking process, Cloake says: \u201cIf you cut down, say, a slow-cooked scrambled egg recipe, unless you have a very small pan, the smaller volume of liquid will get too much exposure to heat, and will dry out and overcook as a result.\u201d Cookware is very important, too. \u201cI found out the hard way recently, when making a Dutch baby for a bunch of hungry kids,\u201d confesses Goh, who simply doubled the batter but used the same size pan. The result? The batter rose just a quarter of the way up the sides: \u201cIt looked OK initially, but without the surface area to puff up majestically, it pooled in the centre and ended up dense and rubbery.\u201d So if, for example, you want to double a recipe, be sure to double the size of your tray or dish as well, especially if it\u2019s going in the oven. That said, it\u2019s often also best to scale up but cook in batches. Let\u2019s take a stir-fry as an example: \u201cA good one depends on wok hei [literally, \u201cthe breath of the wok\u201d] to impart the essential flavour, aroma and texture,\u201d Goh says, so overcrowding not only lowers the temperature, but also makes ingredients trickier to toss, leading to \u201csteamed rather than al dente vegetables\u201d. Cooking times might also vary, and Cloake\u2019s advice is to trust your instincts: \u201cCheck early, check often.\u201d And if you\u2019re playing around with cakes, it\u2019s going to be trial and error. \u201cA larger amount of batter in the same tin might not cook in the time specified in the original recipe,\u201d Goh says, while a smaller amount will result in overcooked cake. \u201cAdjusting the size of the pan or baking time will help, but there\u2019s no easy formula.\u201d It\u2019s much easier to scale the likes of muffins, says Meliz Berg, author of Dinner Tonight. \u201cIf you\u2019re making six instead of 12, for example, it shouldn\u2019t make a difference, as long as you\u2019re using the same size muffin cases [as in the original recipe].\u201d Ultimately, however, leftovers aren\u2019t something to be feared, but embraced. \u201cWe used to live off them when we were children,\u201d Berg says, \u201cand we still do in my house.\u201d Storing made-ahead meals in the fridge or freezer will just make dinners and snacks easier, and can be economical to boot.

            "date": "2024-10-28T10:00:27Z",
            "content": "Two poems from At the Dimensional Border In our battle to be rational, we posit, based on three points, a plane, and say it extends \u2014 not knowing whether the universe is finite or infinite \u2014 indefinitely. Heady with the notions the brain entertains, the liberties it takes. The brain with our lightweight priceless belongings suitable for starting a home, a world packed in the suitcase of our cranium. As far and farther than the eye can see, the plane extends, with no transcendence or end, and the crafty stick-figure Odysseus who long ago set off to battle foes in a fabulous Ilium \u2026 will he ever arrive at the war, or home? *** The stick-figure soldier with stick submachine gun shooting lethal lines across the plane of a page frozen in a never-ending battle will never remember he was drawn by the hand of a child who pencilled him in as indispensable and disposable \u2014 a fragment of the adult he wasn\u2019t or one of a platoon of saviors whose fate he could play with? If I, looking now, at that child, could draw an imaginary line from me to him and down to that infantryman, the scarring graphite might fade to a ceasefire, the paper re-embracing the bitter traces back into the white weave of genesis. Using Euclid\u2019s Elements as \u201cmetaphorical guide\u201d, Philip Fried began writing his 19-poem series, At the Dimensional Border, while experiencing what he describes as \u201cthe flattening effect\u201d of the Covid-19 pandemic. The New York-based writer and editor also drew on memories of reading, as a teenager, Flatlands: a Romance of Many Dimensions a novella published by Edwin A Abbot in 1884, expressing in a rather subterranean manner the schoolmaster-writer\u2019s ambition to satirise Victorian culture. I\u2019ve chosen two poems from Fried\u2019s series (not adjacent in the original text) which illuminate from different angles various further border-crossings in the primary landscape of \u201cthe border between the second and third dimensions\u201d. The definition of \u201cplane\u201d as \u201ca flat surface that extends into infinity\u201d is a useful entry into the first poem. Our \u201cbattle to be rational\u201d, it suggests, is undermined if we inhabitants of the universe don\u2019t know if the latter is finite or infinite. It\u2019s significant that the attainment of rationality is seen as a \u201cbattle\u201d: the poem moves along its own plane from the perfect poise of geometry to the human brain, \u201cheady\u201d with \u201cthe notions\u201d that it entertains and, implicitly, is entertained by. The impudence and zest of \u201ctaking liberties\u201d will land the poem in a mythical dimension, but first there\u2019s a touching portrayal of our organic set of possibilities and limitations: \u201cthe brain with our lightweight priceless belongings / suitable for starting a home, a world / packed in the suitcase of our cranium.\u201d Like all the poems in the series, this is a 13-line, \u201cnot-quite-sonnet\u201d but signals the form it echoes with a stanza break and a nicely positioned \u201cturn\u201d after the eighth. line. The traveller on the journey suggested earlier turns out to be Odysseus, now a two-dimensional \u201ccrafty stick-figure\u201d, in contrast to the imagined three-dimensional plenitude of the \u201cfabulous Ilium\u201d but the direction of his travel is uncertain. Playing on the contradictory word-marriage of \u201cend\u201d with \u201ctranscendence\u201d as, earlier, on \u201cfinite\u201d and \u201cindefinitely,\u201d Fried questions if the traveller\u2019s destinations \u2013 \u201cwar\u201d or \u201chome\u201d \u2013 will ever be attainable. The second poem traces the line back from its speaker to the pencil drawing of \u201cthe stick-figure soldier\u201d he made as a child. The soldier, whose image is somehow frighteningly life-like as he shoots \u201clethal lines across the plane of a page\u201d, is only a \u201cfragment\u201d from the child\u2019s possible adulthood. He doesn\u2019t belong, either, to the child\u2019s \u201cplatoon of saviors\u201d \u2013 toy figures, perhaps, of the comic-book heroes he writes about elsewhere, such as Wolverine and Batman. The soldier is revisited only for the speaker to consider the possibility of bringing about his extinction. The turn is elegantly registered, as in the previous poem, this time with a shift between uncertainties, from the interrogative to the subjunctive. If the adult now could draw \u201can imaginary line\u201d to the child and then to the infantryman, it seems that the latter could be erased altogether, transformed from the \u201cindispensable\u201d to the \u201cdisposable\u201d. This seems to suggest a radical re-imagination of masculinity that surpasses \u201cceasefire\u201d and leads to a delicately but insistently rhymed possibility of disappearance and re-creation, \u201cthe paper re-embracing the bitter traces / back into the white weave of genesis.\u201d This poem is a particularly fine example of Fried\u2019s ability to render large events on a small scale and reveal their significance in the granular detail. Read as anti-war writing, it evokes the limits of what might be called war\u2019s moral two-dimensionalism. And it recalls the opening poem of the series, in which the \u201cstick-figure philosopher\u201d understands, in a \u201cvision / of apocalypse\u201d which includes \u201ca mass migration upending hereness and thereness\u201d, that \u201cthe faceless are the foundation we need not explain.\u201d \u2022 You can read the complete series of poems in the Journal of Humanistic Mathematics, an innovative publication that includes fiction and poetry alongside discussion about maths. The sequence will form the final section of Fried\u2019s new collection, untethered voices, forthcoming from Salmon Press."

One of the leaders of Patriotic Alternative (PA) recently met a teenager in HMP Hull who had been jailed for racially aggravated harassment during the disturbances, his wife told supporters. The white nationalist group is sharing the names and prison addresses of some of those jailed and encouraging supporters to write to them. A former prison governor who led an independent government review of Islamist extremism in prison said he hoped a strategy was already in place when it came to managing the threat posed by the far right in prisons Ian Acheson, who reviewed the threat of Islamist extremism in prisons in 2016, cautioned against a move towards viewing the many hundreds who were convicted of criminal offences during the riots as a single group susceptible to far-right ideas, a narrative that could be welcomed by extremists. \u201cWe have to be extremely careful about gifting these people with an ideology and it\u2019s notable that many of those convicted in the riots had previous convictions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not to say that the prison service shouldn\u2019t be trying to get ahead of the curve and look at who, if anybody, in the steadily growing population of extreme rightwing offenders might be trying to proselytise others.\u201d Acheson, now an adviser on countering extremism and a visiting professor at Staffordshire University, said that when he advised the government in 2016, he was clear that there should be separate units for \u201ccharismatic\u201d Islamist prisoners acting as self-styled \u201cemirs\u201d and exerting a controlling and radicalising influence on the wider Muslim prison population. \u201cI was also clear to say that this can be applied regardless of ideological positions,\u201d he said. PA has been focusing much of its energies on a campaign around one of its leaders, Sam Melia, who was jailed for two years in March after he was found guilty of inciting racial hatred after a series of \u201cstickering\u201d incidents between 2019 and 2021. A judge described him as an antisemite with \u201cNazi sympathies\u201d. His wife, Laura Towler, recently told supporters online that her husband had spoken to one of the prisoners in HMP Hull, a teenager who she said had been sentenced to 26 months for attending a protest. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cWe have robust measures in place to manage offenders and prevent them from radicalising others, whether far-right or otherwise. This includes specialist staff training, monitoring of communications, and targeted interventions, both in custody and upon release, to disrupt harmful ideologies and reduce reoffending. Existing powers in prisons do provide for administrative segregation in the interests of \u201cgood order or discipline\u201d. This includes allowing prisoners to be compulsorily segregated as a punishment or to maintain order. In the case of terrorist offenders and those suspected of radicalisation, such prisoners are put into separation units on the basis of intelligence PA, which is led by the former BNP youth leader Mark Collett, emerged out of splits in the BNP and other groups. While it had been growing in recent years, lately it suffered from its splits, while its momentum has faltered. Some of its followers were involved in the neo-Nazi group National Action, which was subsequently banned under terrorism laws. A PA spokesperson said they were \u201cdelighted to hear that you are considering raising awareness of our fundraiser\u201d. Acheson also addressed the need to respond intelligently to the cohort of young men in prison for far-right related offences, particularly around communications. \u201cClearly, punishment has a role but it also has to have a purpose and that includes working with prisoners to get them to dissociate from their acts,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, the prison system is so degraded that we should not be expecting these people to come out with views that are any different to the ones they went in with.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-15T07:00:07Z",
            "content": "England\u2019s first women\u2019s futsal team are celebrating hitting the target before a ball has been kicked. In the absence of Football Association funding, the squad of 14 history-making players will travel to Moldova to begin qualifiers for the long overdue inaugural Fifa Futsal Women\u2019s World Cup on Wednesday after months of \u201cblood, sweat and tears\u201d raising funds to pay for kit, equipment and training camps. The team have not yet played a match owing to cost constraints and have been sharing cheaper training venues away from St George\u2019s Park with the resurrected men\u2019s squad, who have resorted to their own urgent online appeals to help plug a more daunting \u00a395,000 funding gap by 25 October to guarantee a return to competition in the Uefa 2026 Euros qualifiers four years after the team was scrapped by the FA. \u201cThe women\u2019s team was a must,\u201d said Sion Kitson, the head of performance at England Futsal, the company recruited as a \u201cpartner\u201d by the FA to govern futsal in 2022. \u201cIt needed to be done to grow the game and participation for all. The women\u2019s game is emerging across the world and we don\u2019t want to be left behind.\u201d The FA allocates some funds to England Futsal \u2013 which was founded by the former England futsal coach and now Lincoln City manager, Michael Skubala \u2013 to pay for areas such as coach development but offers nothing for the national teams. England Futsal attracted sufficient sponsorship to fund the women\u2019s trip to Moldova for the four-team tournament, which starts against Finland. Players from both women\u2019s and men\u2019s teams have launched fundraising appeals to pay their way. \u201cIt\u2019s quite an achievement,\u201d said Ali Miller, who plays club futsal for Birmingham Women and football for West Bromwich Albion. \u201cHats off to all the players and people at England Futsal for putting in blood, sweat and tears to get us to this point, ready to compete as an England team despite the funding challenges.\u201d Miller believes the debutants can cause an upset on court. \u201cQualifying for the first World Cup would be insane,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be realistic \u2013 we\u2019ve not played a match. But we\u2019re also an unknown, and we could go and wipe everyone out and reach the next round in March. We\u2019d then have a load more fundraising to do \u2026 but we\u2019d be up for that challenge.\u201d For Emma Tune, the impact will be felt beyond their attempt to reach the finals in the Philippines next year. \u201cFor young girls, seeing an England women\u2019s futsal team gives them something to aim for,\u201d said the London Helvecia captain. \u201cJust like the football women, we can have a huge impact on the rise of futsal in England.\u201d Kitson said he was \u201cconfident we\u2019ll be there or thereabouts\u201d on fundraising for the men\u2019s team to enter the six-match home and away qualifying group for Euro 2026 but appealed for potential sponsors keen to \u201cbuild new partnerships with an exciting sport\u201d to get in touch. England Futsal face a \u20ac10,000 Uefa fine should the men\u2019s team withdraw. The Guardian understands some senior figures in Fifa and Uefa are frustrated at the FA\u2019s reluctance to commit to futsal, regarded as the dominant game in schools and a professional sport as well as a football development tool in places such as Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Russia, France and Iran. In England, Pete Sturgess, the former England men\u2019s futsal coach, asked on X recently: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have a national association willing to invest in this incredible game? This can\u2019t be right.\u201d An FA spokesperson declined to say whether it would step in to cover the shortfall should the men\u2019s team fail to reach the \u00a395,000 target, adding that since 2022 the FA had provided \u201csupport for England Futsal to run CPD for coaches and referees and a mentoring programme\u201d. It said: \u201cThe launch of England Futsal has also seen the U19s men\u2019s team compete in the Uefa Euros 2022, and FA approval and endorsement for them to enter the senior England teams in Uefa and Fifa competitions, based on the programme being funded and delivered by England Futsal. We look forward to continuing to work with England Futsal.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-25T19:53:55Z",
            "content": "Timothy Darvill, who has died aged 66 of cancer, worked on international archaeological projects in the Isle of Man, Malta, Russia, Germany and the US, but was best known for his research on Stonehenge, which he fervently believed was a prehistoric healing centre. His excavations within the stone circle in 2008 were the first to be permitted there for more than 40 years. Darvill\u2019s trench in the south-east sector of the monument, between the trilithons and the outer sarsen circle, was designed to investigate the circle of bluestone pillars there, and to obtain evidence for the date of their insertion. It was thought that the bluestones represented one of the earliest phases of the monument. Charcoal recovered suggested a date of around 2300BC for the construction of the bluestone circle, but most interesting of all were finds that pointed towards significant modification in the later Roman period, with stone working going on well into the early medieval. It was clear that some stones had lost more than two-thirds of their original size thanks to such chipping and reworking. With his fellow archaeologist Geoff Wainwright, Darvill also worked on a number of sites in the Preseli hills of north Pembrokeshire, trying to identify a quarry source for the bluestones and, at the time of his death, he was about to start the final season (of a seven-year project) of excavation on an untouched early neolithic long barrow in the Cotswolds, the first to be fully investigated in nearly four decades. His work on the Isle of Man (1995-2003) found the first major areas of neolithic and early bronze age settlement and ceremonial enclosures identified on the island. Prodigiously talented, Darvill had already gained a wealth of practical archeological experience by the time he left school, and by the age of 30 had achieved more than most people manage in a whole career. He was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, the son of Michael, an engineer, and Winnie, a nurse, who both loved history and took Tim to visit heritage sites when he was a child. At All Saints\u2019 school, he participated in local excavations at weekends and during school holidays, and by 17 had risen to site supervisor. He was directing his own excavations before he went to study archaeology at Southampton University in 1976. His first archaeological paper, on neolithic Gloucestershire, was published when he was 20, and he went on to do a PhD at Southampton on the neolithic chambered tombs of Wales and western England, which he received in 1983. Darvill combined his studies with summers spent on digs, including his own project at a neolithic site near Cheltenham. His time at Southampton was a formative experience, during which he was taught by the leading prehistorian Colin Renfrew. With his fellow students Mike Parker Pearson, Bob Smith and Roger Thomas, in 1977 Darvill organised a conference titled New Approaches to Our Past, publishing the proceedings the following year. This brought Darvill to the attention of Wainwright, at English Heritage, who became his mentor, active supporter and close friend. While the other three students joined the staff of English Heritage, Darvill returned to Gloucestershire and in 1985 took the bold decision to set up his own private practice consultancy, delivering research and development projects for government agencies, developers and local authorities. Such consultancies were virtually unknown at that time, and his decision was extremely forward looking. He picked up a stream of contracts, researching and publishing strategies to ensure the preservation and management of archaeological remains, and quickly established himself as a leading light in the relatively new field of cultural resource management. Darvill had no truck with the perception of archaeologists as anti-development, and believed that working with developers was the best means of securing successful outcomes. He contributed to the environmental impact assessment for the Channel tunnel and advised on the implications of a proposed major retail development in Cirencester. With characteristic foresight he recognised that the anticipated programme of archaeological investigation in the town would be beyond the capacity of the local excavation committee, run then by people in their spare time. The relationship between archaeology and development was changing, and a more professional approach was required. He persuaded the committee that it should reconstitute itself as a limited company and registered charity. A trust was duly formed, and Darvill became its chairman in 1992, a position he held until his death. Cotswold Archaeology is now one of the largest professional archaeology companies in the UK, and the link with the archaeology of his home county was one that he cherished. Darvill was never worried by his inexperience or lack of years compared with his more senior peers. He was confident in his own abilities, did not naturally defer to those older than him, and could be combative in defending his opinions. While still in his 20s he had published Prehistoric Britain (1987), which became a standard text on many undergraduate courses. Its chapter titles drew on his love of music; for instance, the section on hunter-gatherer societies was titled Bands on the Run. Later publications included Prehistoric Britain from the Air (1996), Long Barrows of the Cotswolds (2004), Stonehenge: The Biography of a Landscape (2006) and Prehistoric Gloucestershire (2013), and he compiled the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology (2010). Appointed in 1991 to the newly established chair of archaeology and property development at Bournemouth Polytechnic (later University), aged 33, he was then the youngest person appointed to a chair of archaeology since Sir Barry Cunliffe in 1966. He was a young man in a hurry, and threw himself into the role with gusto. As director of what is now the department of archaeology and anthropology at Bournemouth, he delivered popular undergraduate units on heritage, archaeological practice and neolithic Europe over three decades. In the mid-1990s he won a contract for \u00a31m \u2013 a very large sum for an archaeological consultancy \u2013 to undertake the Monuments at Risk Survey (Mars) for English Heritage, studying the changing state of England\u2019s archaeology and providing recommendations for monitoring change at hundreds of historic sites. Later he directed the Archaeological Investigations Project, again funded by English Heritage, which produced a comprehensive listing of the more than 80,000 projects undertaken in England between 1990 and 2010. He was appointed OBE in 2010. Darvill was always most comfortable in the company of other archaeologists, talking and debating, ideally over a curry and a pint. He did find time for other things in life, particularly music, and was the guitarist in a Bournemouth-based rock group called the Standing Stones. His other interests included folk traditions and book collecting; he possessed an enormous archaeological library from which he drew much pleasure. He married his partner, Caoimhe Irvine, a fellow archaeologist, in hospital shortly before his death, and she survives him. \u2022 Timothy Charles Darvill, archaeologist, born 22 December 1957; died 5 October 2024"

            "date": "2024-10-31T10:34:09Z",
            "content": "The International Monetary Fund has welcomed the measures announced by Rachel Reeves in her first budget, saying her \u00a340bn of tax rises would boost growth \u201csustainably\u201d. In a rare intervention, the Washington-based IMF backed her increase in investment and extra spending to ease the financial pressure on public services and boost growth. A spokesperson for the fund said new budget rules showed the government was committed to bringing down the UK\u2019s debts over the longer term. \u201cWe support the envisaged reduction in the deficit over the medium term, including by sustainably raising revenue,\u201d they said, adding that the IMF approved of the government\u2019s \u201cfocus on boosting growth through a needed increase in public investment while addressing urgent pressures on public services\u201d. Meanwhile, a leading UK thinktank has warned that despite Reeves\u2019s push to invest, the budget would not end Britain\u2019s record as \u201cstagnation nation\u201d. The Resolution Foundation\u2019s assessment of Labour\u2019s first budget in almost 15 years said the chancellor had made a \u201cdecisive shift from the planned cuts set out by the last government, with better-funded public services and greater public investment coming from higher taxes and more borrowing\u201d. It said the rise in public investment, reversing planned cuts set out by the previous Tory administration, meant spending on public infrastructure would be maintained at about 2.6% of annual national income in each of the next five years. \u201cThis would be the highest five-year average in the UK since 1980-81, and bring the country close to the OECD average,\u201d the thinktank said. However, it warned that Labour\u2019s spending spree to inject \u00a370bn a year into the economy from increases in day-to-day and investment spending had \u201cnot yet delivered a decisive shift away from Britain\u2019s record as a stagnation nation\u201d. The foundation\u2019s verdict came after the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government\u2019s independent forecaster, concluded that while the budget would probably improve public services and give public investment a boost, it would do little to lift economic growth over the next five years. In a blow to Reeves, who had claimed before the budget that her measures would give the economy a boost, the OBR said a hefty rise in business taxes would limit the economy\u2019s expansion to 1.5% in the final year of the parliament, down from 2% next year. Reeves said in her speech to parliament that the OBR had agreed that her plans would improve the UK\u2019s growth prospects by 1.5% over the longer term. The Resolution Foundation said a generous outcome for the NHS in the budget left many other Whitehall departments making difficult decisions over the next five years. The health service will receive 40% of the \u00a335bn increase to day-to-day public service spending between 2023-24 and 2025-26. As a result, the 2025-26 health budget would account for 42% of all departmental spending, up from 31% in 2007-08, it said. Between 2025-26 and 2029-30 spending will increase by 1.3% on average across all Whitehall departments. Once the extra spending for health, schools and defence was ringfenced, the budget \u201cimplies \u00a310.8bn of real per person cuts to unprotected departments, sending their funding back to 2015-16 levels\u201d, the report said. Tax and benefit changes outlined in the budget would \u201cfall on everyone\u2019s shoulders\u201d once the combined impact of welfare cuts, an increase in employer national insurance rises and tax rises on consumer goods are felt evenly across the income distribution. \u201cThe poorest half of households face a 0.8% reduction in their annual income on average, while the richest half face a 0.6% decrease,\u201d the report said. \u201cHowever, increases to capital gains and inheritance taxes (not included in the modelling of day-to-day tax and benefits) are more progressive, so wealthy households will face the largest cash impact overall.\u201d Mike Brewer, the thinktank\u2019s interim chief executive, said: \u201cRachel Reeves\u2019s first ever budget was never going to be a crowd-pleaser, given the profound and often conflicting challenges she faced, from failing public services to perilous public finances, weak growth and stagnating living standards. \u201cWith Britain finally turning the page on its longstanding failure to invest thanks to a \u00a3100bn boost to public capital spending, the hope is that this short-term pain will eventually turn into a long-term living standards gain. But if it doesn\u2019t, future budgets won\u2019t be any easier to deliver, especially if further tax rises are needed.\u201d"

Shares in the e-commerce giant rose in after-hours trading. The company reported revenue of $158.9bn against analyst expectations of $157.2bn, and earnings per share of $1.43, compared to $1.16 expected by Bloomberg analysts. Amazon reported $27.5bn for the previous three months, a 19% increase, in line with analysts\u2019 expectations from the cloud computing business. The pace of growth is faster than the company reported last year, a positive sign for Wall Street. Its advertising business also brought in as much revenue as analysts expected. In August, the company reported that its Amazon Web Services division pulled in $26bn in revenue compared to $22bn for the same period in 2023. A day earlier Microsoft reported significant growth in its cloud computing division, but that failed to satisfy investors. Shares in the company dropped more than 5% on Thursday. Google reported 33% growth in its cloud business, which led to a modest increase in its stock price. \u201cInvestors need to see the monetization of AI spreading to the rest of the tech landscape,\u201d Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst, said this week. \u201cThe next few weeks will be the linchpin to confirmation that the AI \u2018use case phase\u2019 have now begun within the enterprise world.\u201d Amazon executives have previously said that in the second quarter of 2024, Amazon Web Services had an annualized revenue run rate of more than $105bn.

Investors are also looking at Amazon\u2019s effort to rival Elon Musk\u2019s space-based Internet service, known as Project Kuiper, that plans to place 3,236 satellites into low Earth orbit and then to provide global broadband access.

            "date": "2024-10-18T10:27:44Z",
            "content": "Sales growth in shops in Great Britain slowed last month as an increase in purchases of technology was tempered by the largest monthly fall in spending at supermarkets this year. The last official snapshot of consumer activity before the budget showed a modest 0.3% increase in spending in shops and online \u2013 down on August\u2019s 1% increase but better than financial markets had expected. Despite warnings from the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, for the public to be braced for tax increases in the budget on 30 October, the data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) provided evidence of falling inflation and rising real incomes encouraging consumers to spend more freely. Sales growth in the third quarter of 2024 \u2013 a better guide to the underlying trend than one month\u2019s figures \u2013 rose by 1.9%, compared with a fall of 0.2% in the second quarter. Amid reports that consumer confidence has dropped sharply on fears of a tough budget, the consensus among economists was that retail sales volumes would fall by 0.3% in September. Retail sales do not include some big-ticket items of consumer spending \u2013 including foreign travel and car sales \u2013 but the better-than-expected September figure will be a boost to Reeves as she puts the finishing touches to her tax and spending plans. The ONS said sales volumes at all non-food stores \u2013 which include clothing, household and department stores \u2013 rose by 2.5% in September. This was underpinned by 5.5% month-on-month growth from \u201cother\u201d non-food stores, led by a bumper month for computer and mobile phone retailers, which were buoyed by product launches such as Apple\u2019s new iPhone 16. Analysts suggested this was partly down to parents stocking up for pupils as the new school year started. Oliver Vernon-Harcourt, the head of retail at Deloitte, said: \u201cA back-to-school boost saw retail sales rise for a third consecutive month, with sales of computers and additional clothing and footwear bolstering growth. While many consumers continue to hold back on purchasing big-ticket items, the sale of smaller non-essential luxuries has propped up sales values.\u201d However, this was partly offset by a 2.4% fall in sales at supermarkets, the largest month-on-month fall for food stores this year. \u201cRetail sales grew in September as tech stores reported a notable rise in sales,\u201d said Hannah Finselbach, a senior statistician at the ONS. \u201cThese were only partially offset by a poor month for supermarkets, where retailers said bad weather and households continuing to cut back on luxury food items hit sales.\u201d Sales volumes rose 3.9% across the year to the end of September, the largest annual rise since February 2022. \u201cSeptember saw the strongest retail sales growth since January, and the highest sales volume since March 2022,\u201d said Kris Hamer, the director of Insight at the British Retail Consortium. \u201c[However], big-ticket items, such as furniture and other household goods, continued to take the hit from some consumers, such as those saving for Christmas or preferring to spend their money on experiences.\u201d Despite the rise, Hamer said retailers were \u201cnervously\u201d awaiting the budget at the end of the month, particularly the impact of a possible increase to employer national insurance contributions, as well as the annual inflationary increase to business rates next year. \u201cThese changes would add more pressure to an industry that already pays far more than its fair share in business taxes,\u201d Hamer said. \u201cThe chancellor should use the budget to level the playing field with other parts of the economy.\u201d Asif Aziz, the retail director at EE, said the mobile phone operator had enjoyed a fillip from the launch of the iPhone 16, with pre-orders beginning on 13 September and the handset arriving in stores a week later. He said: \u201cThese are welcome signs of light in the autumnal gloom, but as we enter the critical \u2018golden quarter\u2019 [running up to Christmas], retailers will be hoping the rise in energy bills and a potentially difficult budget will not dent this positive momentum.\u201d"

            "content": "Chinese stocks have suffered their worst fall in 27 years after efforts by Beijing to stimulate the world\u2019s second-largest economy disappointed investors. Stock markets in Asia fell sharply after China\u2019s top economic planning authority failed to announce further measures to improve flagging growth. On Tuesday, the National Development and Reform Commission held a press conference in which officials were expected to reveal specific policies to supplement the stimulus measures announced last month. However, the hoped-for policy plans were not forthcoming. Instead, the NDRC officials mostly summarised September\u2019s announcements and commented on the general economic situation. The disappointment pierced the stock frenzy that had rallied the market in the days after the September stimulus announcement. On Wednesday, the Shenzhen composite index tumbled by 8.2% in its biggest fall since May 1997, while the Shanghai stock exchange lost 6.6% and the benchmark CSI 300 slid by 7.1% after the Golden Week holiday. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was down by 1.4%. However, the markets remain higher than a month ago, before the central bank and the politburo proposed a \u201cpackage of incremental policies\u201d to stabilise China\u2019s ailing economy. The CSI 300 index is 7% higher than it was a year ago. After the stock market plunge, the State Council Information Office said it would host a press conference on Saturday attended by finance minister Lan Fo\u2019an. The theme of the news conference is \u201cintensifying countercyclical adjustment of fiscal policy to promote high-quality economic development\u201d. Certain fiscal measures, such as the issuance of government bonds, require the approval of China\u2019s legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress. The Congress\u2019s standing committee meets in late October, an event that will be closely watched by analysts and investors for signs about further stimulus measures. Richard Hunter, the head of markets for the trading platform Interactive Investor, described Wednesday\u2019s stock market falls as a reflection of \u201cinvestor disappointment\u201d. He said: \u201cThe main concern was that the raft of measures announced prior to last week\u2019s holiday \u2013 which had lit the fire under a moribund market \u2013 were not followed up with any specific actions from the authorities, or indeed further plans.\u201d Alvin Tan, the head of Asia FX strategy at RBC capital markets, told Reuters that investors had expected stimulus measures worth 2tn-3tn yuan (\u00a3200bn-\u00a3300bn) to be announced this month. Positive sentiment \u201cwill turn quickly if we don\u2019t get some package at least matching\u201d that range, Tan said. China\u2019s economy has struggled to recover from the coronavirus pandemic and is beset by a range of structural and geopolitical problems, including a struggling property market. According to official statistics, the urban youth unemployment rate reached 18.8% in August, while the urban unemployment rate across all age groups was 5.3%. There are growing concerns that China will miss its own 5% annual growth target, a relatively modest goal by the country\u2019s historical standards. Meanwhile, the government is engaged in a tit-for-tat trade war with the EU, one of China\u2019s most important trade partners. On Tuesday, Beijing announced tariffs on imports of European brandy and said it was considering duties on imported petrol cars. The levies followed a vote by EU leaders to tax imports of Chinese electric vehicles."

            "content": "Inflation weakened to its slowest pace in more than three years last month, as price growth continued to fall back from its highest levels in a generation. With concerns over the heightened cost of living at the heart of the presidential election campaign, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its final monthly inflation reading before voters head to the polls. The consumer price index rose at an annual pace of 2.4% in September, slightly higher than economists\u2019 expectations of 2.3%, and down from 2.5% in August. The so-called \u201ccore\u201d index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, increased at an annual rate of 3.3%. Over the month, prices rose 0.2%. Gasoline prices dropped by 4.1% during September, and were 15.3% lower than a year ago. But problems remain. Shelter costs rose 0.2% and food prices increased 0.4% in September, contributing over 75% of the monthly all items increase. Egg prices rose 8.4%. Though prices surged three years ago, their rapid growth has since slowed significantly from its 9.1% peak in June 2022 and prices are now rising at their slowest rate since February 2021. The US Federal Reserve, which scrambled to increase interest rates in an effort to cool the world\u2019s largest economy, started cutting rates last month. The broader US economy appears to be growing at a robust pace. American employers added 254,000 jobs last month, according to official data released on Friday, defying fears of a slowdown in the labor market. Lael Brainard, the White House national economic adviser, said: \u201cWe keep making progress, with inflation returning to pre-pandemic levels, 16m jobs created, lower interest rates, and low unemployment.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-18T13:04:24Z",
            "content": "A US startup company is offering to help wealthy couples screen their embryos for IQ using controversial technology that raises questions about the ethics of genetic enhancement. The company, Heliospect Genomics, has worked with more than a dozen couples undergoing IVF, according to undercover video footage. The recordings show the company marketing its services at up to $50,000 (\u00a338,000) for clients seeking to test 100 embryos, and claiming to have helped some parents select future children based on genetic predictions of intelligence. Managers boasted their methods could produce a gain of more than six IQ points. Experts say the development represents an ethical minefield. The information has emerged from video recordings made by the campaign group Hope Not Hate, which went undercover to investigate separate groups of activists and academics. The Guardian reviewed the recordings and conducted further research alongside Hope Not Hate. The footage appears to show experimental genetic selection techniques being advertised to prospective parents. A Heliospect employee, who has been helping the company recruit clients, outlined how couples could rank up to 100 embryos based on \u201cIQ and the other naughty traits that everybody wants\u201d, including sex, height, risk of obesity and risk of mental illness. The startup says its prediction tools were built using data provided by UK Biobank, a taxpayer-funded store of genetic material donated by half a million British volunteers, which aims to only share data for projects that are \u201cin the public interest\u201d. Selecting embryos on the basis of predicted high IQ is not permitted under UK law. While it is legal in the US, where embryology is more loosely regulated, IQ screening is not yet commercially available there. Asked for comment, managers at Heliospect said the company, which is incorporated in the US, operated within all applicable law and regulations. They said Heliospect was in \u201cstealth mode\u201d before a planned public launch and was still developing its service. They added that clients who screened fewer embryos were charged about $4,000, and that pricing on launch would be in line with competitors. Leading geneticists and bioethicists said the project raised a host of moral and medical issues. Dagan Wells, a professor of reproductive genetics at University of Oxford, asked: \u201cIs this a test too far, do we really want it? It feels to me that this is a debate that the public has not really had an opportunity to fully engage in at this point.\u201d Katie Hasson, associate director of the Center for Genetics and Society, in California, said: \u201cOne of the biggest problems is that it normalises this idea of \u2018superior\u2019 and \u2018inferior\u2019 genetics.\u201d The rollout of such technologies, she said, \u201creinforces the belief that inequality comes from biology rather than social causes\u201d. \u2018Disease-free, smart, healthy\u2019 For Michael Christensen, Heliospect\u2019s Danish CEO and a former financial markets trader, genetic selection promises a bright future. \u201cEveryone can have all the children they want and they can have children that are basically disease-free, smart, healthy; it\u2019s going to be great,\u201d he boasted during a video call in November 2023. Listening to his pitch was an undercover researcher for Hope Not Hate, posing as a UK-based professional looking to start a family. Over the course of several online meetings, the team presented their \u201cpolygenic scoring\u201d service. Heliospect does not provide IVF, but rather uses algorithms to analyse the genetic data supplied by parents to predict the specific traits of their individual embryos. The team offered a guided tour of their test website, which is not yet public. During the presentation, they claimed selecting the \u201csmartest\u201d of 10 embryos would lead to an average IQ gain of more than six points, although other traits such as height and risk of obesity or acne could be prioritised depending on personal preferences. Eventually, Christensen envisaged, the advent of lab-grown eggs would allow couples to create embryos on an industrial scale \u2013 a thousand, or even a million \u2013 from which an elite selection could be handpicked. In future, he speculated, the offering might be extended to include personality types, including providing scores for what he called the \u201cdark triad\u201d traits. Dark triad is normally a reference to machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy. Christensen said it might also be possible to develop scores for depression and creativity. \u201cBeauty is something lots of people actually ask about,\u201d he added. When contacted for comment, Heliospect said it would not condone industrial-scale egg or embryo production or elite selection and that it did not plan to offer testing for \u201cdark triad\u201d traits or beauty. Among the firm\u2019s senior staff is the academic Jonathan Anomaly, who has caused controversy after defending what he describes as \u201cliberal eugenics\u201d. A former Oxford University fellow who left an academic post in Ecuador last year to work full-time at Heliospect, Anomaly says he has advised the company on media strategy and helped recruit investors and clients based in the US and Europe. Anomaly is a well-known figure in a growing transatlantic movement that promotes development of genetic selection and enhancement tools, which he says should not be confused with coercive state-sponsored eugenics. \u201cAll we mean by [liberal eugenics] is that parents should be free and maybe even encouraged to use technology to improve their children\u2019s prospects once it\u2019s available,\u201d he told the podcast The Dissenter. Heliospect was granted access to UK Biobank data in June 2023. Founded in 2006 by the Department of Health and medical research charities, the Biobank holds the genetic information, brain scans, cognitive tests and the educational and medical records of 500,000 volunteers who signed up to share their data for life. The anonymised data it shares is credited with helping lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of cancer, heart disease and diabetes. In its application for access, Heliospect said it hoped to use advanced techniques to improve the prediction of \u201ccomplex traits\u201d. It did not disclose screening of embryos as an intended commercial application or mention IQ. When contacted by the Guardian the company said cognitive ability or intellectual disability fell within the scope of its application. UK Biobank said Heliospect\u2019s use of the data appeared to be \u201centirely consistent with our access conditions\u201d. In the UK, fertility treatments are strictly regulated, with tests performed on embryos legally restricted to a list of serious health conditions approved by regulators. During one of the recordings, the Heliospect team appeared to suggest it might be legally possible for a UK-based couple to request the genetic data for their future children that is incidentally generated during approved tests on embryos and send it overseas for analysis. They also advised that a simpler option might be travelling to the US for IVF and stated that they would abide by any national regulations. By late 2023, the founders of Heliospect claimed to have already analysed and helped select embryos for five couples, which had subsequently been implanted through IVF. \u201cThere are babies on the way,\u201d Christensen said. When contacted, Heliospect said that it specialised in genomic prediction tools with applications in embryonic screening and adult testing and that its authorised access to UK Biobank data was valuable in developing these products in a scientifically rigorous manner. It said that it was not seeking to circumvent UK regulations on embryo testing and that UK Biobank did not require companies to disclose the precise commercial applications of research. It said that it supported addressing concerns about preimplantation embryonic screening through public education, policy discussions, and properly informed debates about the technology, which it strongly believed had potential to help people. In response to questions, Anomaly stated that as a professor of philosophy, he had published provocative articles intended to stimulate debate and that \u201cliberal eugenics\u201d was accepted terminology in the academic field of bioethics. The decision to grant access to Heliospect raises questions about the ethical criteria applied when granting research access to UK Biobank. Its controls are under scrutiny after revelations in the Guardian on Thursday that a \u201crace science\u201d research group claimed to have obtained its data. Prof Hank Greely, a bioethicist at Stanford University, said: \u201cUK Biobank, and the UK government, may want to think harder about whether it needs to impose some new restrictions.\u201d In a statement, Prof Sir Rory Collins, UK Biobank\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cUK Biobank \u2026 has confirmed that its analyses of our data have been used solely for their approved purpose to generate genetic risk scores for particular conditions, and are exploring the use of their findings for preimplantation screening in accordance with relevant regulation in the US where Heliospect is based. This is entirely consistent with our access conditions. By making data available, UK Biobank is allowing discoveries to emerge that would not otherwise have been possible, saving lives and preventing disability and misery.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-15T12:29:24Z",
            "content": "At the Crown Heights, Brooklyn, bar Whoopsie Daisy, on a sunny fall afternoon, patrons drank natural wines while their children ran around the outdoor garden. Little dogs peeped out from under tables or the tops of backpacks. Modish twentysomethings took turns playing music on their cellphones. While the location was a bar, the snacks on offer were not nachos or day-old pretzels. Patrons feasted on exquisite vegan cardamon-rose baklava and saffron ice-cream sandwiches. The chef behind the snacks was no short-order cook. Lena Derisavifard, the baker-founder behind the Iranian-influenced pastry company BiBi Bakery, was clad in a denim jumpsuit, chunky green-framed sunglasses and Persian-rug-themed Vans. And the music sailing out of diners\u2019 phones was not a bog-standard bar playlist but rather a mixture of traditional Iranian music and Persian pop. Derisavifard\u2019s parents were immigrants from Iran who \u201cended up across the world\u201d, in Texas. Eating Persian meals together helped the family survive the absence of Iranian culture in the American south-west. \u201cFood was the biggest way for our family to teach us about Iran,\u201d said Derisavifard, 34. Her grandfather built an oven in the family garage, where her grandmother made bread. Growing up, Derisavifard baked with her mother, but ultimately decided to enter a more practical profession than being a chef. She majored in engineering at Southern Methodist University and after graduation got a job in finance, ultimately moving on to a healthcare non-profit. Cooking remained her passion, though. Two years ago, Derisavifard decided to take the leap into baking for money. After she got the necessary permits and LLC status, she applied to sell her baked goods in outdoor markets in Brooklyn. Last December, she started shipping her products direct to consumers nationwide. Around that time, Derisavifard applied to participate in the New York-based non-profit food business incubator Hot Bread Kitchen (HBK). She entered Start, the organization\u2019s small-business program, in fall of 2022. A finalist, she pitched the idea of BiBi Bakery during their showcase. She won and got funding to rent hours of access to a couple of commercial kitchen spaces in Brooklyn. That kitchen is where she now makes her baklava cookies and eggplant dip. She is also involved in a mentorship program that HBK rolled out earlier this year. Derisavifard receives regular coaching from an adviser, the director of operations for the cult olive oil company Graza. Their sessions focus on Derisavifard\u2019s desire to turn BiBi into a brick-and-mortar store. HBK, which started out as a social enterprise bakery 15 years ago, now specializes in training culinary entrepreneurs like Derisavifard, and has subsidized more than 670 kitchen hours in 2024 so far. Recipients of support are usually descendants of underrepresented groups. According to the American Immigration Council, in 2022 11% of immigrant women were entrepreneurs, up from 8% in 2000. Immigrant women are also statistically more likely to own businesses than women born in the US. All the HBK participants are female or gender-expansive, and many are Bipoc. At monthly meetings with mentors, they work on everything from labeling and packaging products, food science and supply-chain questions. HBK also offers instruction in business practices. The obstacles its clients face are especially great in places like Brooklyn, where rents are high and access to startup capital is limited. In such an environment, it\u2019s hard to fulfill the basic need of bringing in personal income. As Derisavifard sees it, \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to manage the income-generating aspects of the business\u201d like shopping for ingredients, packaging the product or dropping parcels off at the post office, while at the same time keeping \u201cadmin/foundational/behind-the scenes-parts\u201d of the business going, like managing her company finances on QuickBooks and devoting time to recipe development. All of these elements are needed to sustain and grow the business, said Derisavifard, but there isn\u2019t always enough time to do them all well. That\u2019s where HBK comes in, offering support to women looking to find a sustainable path in the food world. According to Azra Samiee, 38, the director of small-business programs for HBK, the food industry \u201cis a great entry point into the workforce for immigrant women\u201d. A report in Restaurant Business magazine said that 69% of mid-level restaurant workers were women. After Derisavifard left her last job, in the healthcare field, she self-funded BiBi, putting \u201call of my savings into the business\u201d. Right now, she is a one-woman show, doing everything from managing orders to the business\u2019s social media accounts, where she promotes her goods as well as various pop-up series, including an upcoming event inspired by \u201cthe lazy ritual of Iranian breakfast\u201d. It will include \u201cgrazing boards\u201d of feta cheese and walnuts, among other delicacies. So far, Derisavifard\u2019s strategy is working, albeit modestly. Based on 2024 year-to-date sales, BiBi projects it will have a 16% increase in sales from 2023. At the Whoopsie Daisy pop-up, Derisavifard handed out sepia postcards of her Persian grannies (\u201cbibi\u201d means grandmother in Persian) along with an array of desserts. Part of why she\u2019s doing this is because she wants to \u201cshare the Iranian culture in a time when people hear the word \u2018Iran\u2019\u201d and they think of grim political realities rather than the region\u2019s tastes and pleasures \u2013 or, as she put it, \u201cbarberry and saffron\u201d. Ultimately, Derisavifard said she hopes to \u201cwean\u201d herself off HBK\u2019s kitchen and coaching program and open her own bakery by 2025. She will continue to make her desserts, which include such revisionist delights as peanut-butter-and-jelly baklava. \u201cDessert might not be the soundest food,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it nourishes the soul.\u201d Alissa Quart is the executive director of the Economic Hardship Reporting Project and the author of seven books, most recently Bootstrapped: Liberating Ourselves from the American Dream"

            "date": "2024-10-26T15:19:28Z",
            "content": "Scientists are braced for the prospect of major cuts in research funding in the budget this week. Some senior figures say they worry that as much as \u00a31bn could be taken from the cash that is given to finance science projects in the UK. The main focus of scientists\u2019 concern has been the extra \u00a31bn that will be needed to pay for UK membership of the EU\u2019s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme, which Britain rejoined last year. This money may have to be found from savings elsewhere, with the \u00a38bn annual budget of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) \u2013 the UK\u2019s main backer of basic research \u2013 almost certain to be raided if no additional money is supplied by Reeves. Cuts on this level would jeopardise the nation\u2019s standing as a world leader in basic research, they say, and could leave UKRI struggling to fund new projects. \u201cThe prospect of cuts on the level being touted this week \u2013 up to \u00a31bn \u2013 and fears that UKRI would be left with no grant funding at all to offer next year is deeply concerning and will do real damage to our research and innovation ecosystem,\u201d the Nobel prize winner Prof Andre Geim and the former Manchester University president Prof Nancy Rothwell write in an article for the Observer online. \u201cPut simply, if the government makes moves to cut off the flow of R&amp;D funding now, they can\u2019t just turn the tap back on in a few years\u2019 time and expect to see the same results,\u201d say Rothwell, a physiologist, and Geim, who won his Nobel prize for his role as a co-inventor of the super-strong material graphene. Other senior scientists believe the likely cut imposed by Reeves will be lower than \u00a31bn, although they still fear there will be a significant reduction in funding \u2013 a possibility that led more than 40 of the UK\u2019s most eminent scientists to sign a letter to the Times last week. Major reductions in R&amp;D spending in Britain would have \u201csignificant negative consequences\u201d for the UK, they warned. \u201cCuts now would lead to the loss of jobs, expertise and momentum right when the sector is needed to make a vital contribution to boosting economic growth and productivity,\u201d the group said. One of the letter\u2019s signatories, Prof Ian Boyd of St Andrews University, told the Observer that he believed there was a real fear that a cut was going to be made to the UK\u2019s science budget, and that this could have a particularly damaging effect on new research. \u201cResearch projects often take years to complete, which means funding for them will have already been committed and contracts signed,\u201d he said. \u201cThat in turn means that the only way to impose any new cuts is to axe projects that have not yet been launched and are still in their planning stages. That in turn could mean there will be no new research undertaken in many areas. So the impact could be extremely severe.\u201d Boyd added: \u201cIn addition, cuts will slow down renewals of infrastructure and the training of young scientists, and reduce our capacity to use science to drive economic growth and get us out of the situation we\u2019re in at the moment.\u201d Scientists point to recent major UK scientific successes including Covid vaccines, new cancer drugs and the invention of materials such as graphene. \u201cScience is seed corn,\u201d said the Nobel prize winner Sir Paul Nurse, head of the Francis Crick Institute in London. \u201cIt is an investment in the future. It is also vital to health for research that is carried out now to become the source of new drugs and treatments for the future. So if you reduce science budgets, you are damaging future industry and the future health of the nation.\u201d The impact cuts could have was emphasised by John-Arne R\u00f8ttingen, chief executive of the Wellcome Trust, an independent funder of science in Britain. \u201cWe are committed to investing in a well-functioning research system in the UK. So if we see there are threats to the research budget, we will be very vocal in calling out the need for proper investment.\u201d Nurse \u2013 who was recently re-elected to the post of president of the Royal Society \u2013 said the UK came out near the bottom of an OECD chart of spending on basic R&amp;D. This shows there should be more, not less, government spending on science, he argued. \u201cGiven all these basic points, I just cannot believe this government would be stupid enough to make the kind of cuts that are being rumoured,\u201d he added."

            "date": "2024-10-04T14:33:55Z",
            "content": "The US homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, has warned that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) does not have enough funding to make it through the rest of this hurricane season, which started off more quietly than forecast but has roared into catastrophe with Hurricane Helene and typically runs until the end of November. The warning on Thursday underscored how the federal government is being stretched thin as top Republicans have signaled they won\u2019t give it more funding. \u201cWe are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have. We are expecting another hurricane hitting,\u201d Mayorkas said. \u201cFema does not have the funds to make it through the season.\u201d Mayorkas\u2019 comments come as the agency is providing emergency assistance to those affected by Helene, as the massive storm affected 10 states after coming ashore in Florida a week ago as a category four hurricane, which overall has killed at least 215 people. More than 150,000 households have registered with assistance from Fema, the Associated Press reported, and the agency expects that number to increase. Congress recently approved $20bn for Fema as part of a supplemental spending bill, and gave the agency power to quickly use the funds. Joe Biden has suggested calling the US Congress back from recess, which is supposed to last through the 5 November presidential election, to pass additional funding for the agency. \u201cThat is something I may have to request, but no decision has been made yet,\u201d he said at the White House on Monday. A bipartisan group of senators from affected states, including senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio of Florida, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, also called on Congress to allocate more emergency relief funding. \u201cAlthough the true level of devastation is still unfolding, it is clear that Congress must act to meet the unmet needs in our states and address the scope and scale of destruction experienced by our constituents,\u201d the group wrote in a Tuesday letter. \u201cThis may even require Congress to come back in October to ensure we have enough time to enact legislation before the end of this calendar year.\u201d House speaker Mike Johnson has signaled that supplemental funding would come from Congress, but that the body would not convene immediately to pass it. He predicted more funding would come after election day, when Congress returns from its recess, Politico reported, and that \u201cit will take some time to tabulate\u201d the extent of the damage. Other Republicans have suggested that Fema has enough funding. \u201cIt provides for up to $20bn and we\u2019re not going to run out of money to respond to natural disasters. They didn\u2019t add money, but we can use it faster, and it resolves any concerns I have,\u201d Senator John Kennedy, a hard-right Republican from Louisiana and a member of the Senate appropriations committee, told the Hill. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it in December, particularly if we keep having natural disasters.\u201d Biden rebuffed the suggestion that additional funds could wait, telling reporters on Thursday while touring affected areas in Florida and Georgia: \u201cCan\u2019t wait. People need help now.\u201d Donald Trump and other Republicans have seized on the shortfall to criticize Biden and Kamala Harris for spending money assisting migrants. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Fema, also is in charge of immigration issues. \u201cThey stole the Fema money just like they stole it from a bank so they could give it to their illegal immigrants that they want to have vote for them this season,\u201d Trump said in a speech in Michigan on Thursday. Trump has leaned into the myth of non-citizen voting to seed doubt about the 2024 election. Also, on the campaign trail in Michigan on Thursday, Trump said of Helene victims: \u201cThey\u2019re dying, and they\u2019re getting no help from our federal government because their money has been spent on people that should not be in our country.\u201d In fact, the Biden-Harris administration said that the government has provided $20m in \u201cflexible, upfront funding\u201d for the disaster and deployed 5,000 federal personnel to aid in recovery. Texas governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, echoed Trump\u2019s criticism. \u201cMayorkas and Fema \u2013 immediately stop spending money on illegal immigration resettlement and redirect those funds to areas hit by the hurricane. Put Americans first,\u201d he tweeted. Fema has spent more than $600m on assistance to migrants and an agency spokesperson noted it was misleading to suggest that the funding came at the expense of disaster relief. \u201cThe Shelter and Services Program (SSP) is a completely separate, appropriated grant program that was authorized and funded by Congress and is not associated in any way with Fema\u2019s disaster-related authorities or funding streams,\u201d a spokesperson told NBC News."

Wiegman has promised changes to Friday\u2019s starting XI as she tests out more of her squad. \u201cWe will see different faces tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want more information, I\u2019m not going to tell you, but you will see changes. We want to try out things to see players, connections and, at the same time, with so many games, is to manage the minutes too.\u201d Wiegman urged people to look at the context when discussing the four goals conceded against Germany, the only time England have conceded four under the manager. \u201cI would say look at the bigger picture, the game is improving, we\u2019re playing better players too,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have tough games all the time, which is good, you\u2019ll be exposed when you\u2019re not doing things right enough. Of course you don\u2019t want to concede goals. We\u2019re looking at how we concede goals and how we improve on these moments. Sometimes it starts with how we keep the ball, sometimes it starts with we want to press high and then when we press high, do we get the trigger moments right? Then the tactics come in and we\u2019re working on that all the time.\u201d Stanway was in a lighthearted mood. When prodded by a journalist about her comments about spending some time in the analysis room prior to the Germany game, the Bayern Munich midfielder let out a big laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll take the hit,\u201d she said amid the giggles. \u201cBut to be fair, I did my best to try to recover from the fact I messed up from the beginning. \u201cGermany are a top side and we knew that going into it. It was difficult to prepare for because they would have thrown anything at us. We didn\u2019t really know how they would play, their shape, their formation, it took a little while to adapt to what they were doing. After 30 minutes we found our feet and found the shape we wanted to be in and that allowed us to get more on the front foot and counter and get back at the scoreline. Overall, it\u2019s a learning opportunity, we gave them that scoreline with the way that we played.\u201d"

            "content": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in Croatia on Wednesday that the war could be ended no later than next year. Addressing the third Ukraine-South East Europe summit in Dubrovnik, the Ukrainian leader said: \u201cIn October, November and December, we have a real chance to move the situation towards peace and long-term stability,\u201d he said. \u201cThe situation on the battlefield creates an opportunity to make this choice \u2013 a choice in favour of decisive action to end the war no later than 2025.\u201d Zelenskyy did not spell out how and why he perceived such an opportunity. Russian forces now hold just under 20% of Ukraine\u2019s east and south. Ukraine\u2019s president will be in London on Thursday to meet the new Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer. The hastily arranged meeting comes after a Ramstein summit where Zelenskyy was going to present a \u201cvictory plan\u201d to western leaders was formally postponed after Joe Biden, the US president, cancelled his trip in order to stay at home to respond to Hurricane Milton, as Dan Sabbagh reports. Organisers said the Ramstein meeting of about 20 world leaders in Germany would be rescheduled. Ukrainian sources said Zelenskyy would travel to meet the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Berlin on Friday. Zelenskyy was in Croatia on Wednesday and is scheduled to meet Pope Francis on Friday. At the Croatia summit, Zelenskyy told the press: \u201cI will meet separately in each country with the leaders of Britain, France, Italy and Germany.\u201d A Russian ballistic missile strike on port infrastructure in Odesa region killed six Ukrainian people and wounded 11 others on Wednesday, authorities said. The attack struck a civilian container ship flying the flag of Panama, according to the region\u2019s governor, Oleg Kiper. \u201cThis is the third attack on a civilian vessel in the last four days.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s military said it made a \u201cdirect hit\u201d on a base storing Shahed drones in southern Russia\u2019s Krasnodar region. A statement said the attack near a village called Oktyabrsky was carried out jointly by naval forces and the SBU intelligence service. \u201cAccording to available information, nearly 400 strike drones were stored there,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBased on objective control results, a direct hit was made on the target. Secondary explosions were observed at the site.\u201d Earlier, the Ukrainian military said one of its drones struck an important depot storing North Korean arms along with glide bombs and other munitions in Russia\u2019s Bryansk border region. Russian authorities declared a state of emergency in the area after \u201cdetonations of explosive objects\u201d. Three weeks earlier, another drone blasted a major Russian armoury and this week a drone smashed into a key oil terminal in Russia-occupied Crimea, leaving it burning for days. Analysts have said the strikes on the Kremlin\u2019s armouries have noticeably hit Russian ammunition supplies and reduced the margin by which they outgun the Ukrainians on the battlefield. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, has accused Viktor Orb\u00e1n of a historic failure to support Ukraine, economic mismanagement and making his country a \u201cback door for foreign interference\u201d. At the European parliament in Strasbourg, she pointedly criticised Orb\u00e1n\u2019s stance on Ukraine, Jennifer Rankin reports from Brussels. \u201cThere are still some who blame this war not on Putin\u2019s lust for power but on Ukraine\u2019s thirst for freedom, so I want to ask them: would they ever blame the Hungarians for the Soviet invasion [of Hungary] in 1956?\u201d Von der Leyen criticised Orb\u00e1n for failing to follow through on an EU pledge made in 2022 to end dependency on Russian fossil fuels. \u201cInstead of looking for alternative sources [of energy], in particular, one member state just looked for alternative ways to buy fossil fuels from Russia.\u201d Von der Leyen was speaking after Orb\u00e1n set out the priorities for Hungary\u2019s six-month EU presidency. The usually routine moment in the EU calendar became a boisterous session. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s MEPs in the far-right Patriots for Europe group applauded him while pro-European parties clapped for von der Leyen. Orb\u00e1n also had to listen to a rowdy rendition of the anti-fascist song Bella Ciao from a small group, prompting the speaker, Roberta Metsola, to intervene to bring order: \u201cThis is not Eurovision.\u201d Britain on Thursday launched an Office of Trade Sanctions Implementation with new powers to penalise companies that fail to comply with restrictions on exports services to Russia. The government said that the OTSI would have powers to fine companies that breached sanctions, and also be empowered to publicise them \u2013 essentially \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d the firms involved."

            "content": "Russian troops have nearly reached the centre of Vuhledar in eastern Ukraine, according to the regional governor, Vadym Filashkin, who told Ukrainian TV the situation was very difficult. Public broadcaster Suspilne quoted two soldiers of Ukraine\u2019s 72nd Mechanized Brigade defending Vuhledar as saying that while Russian forces were in control of most of the town \u201ccertain parts\u201d remained under Ukrainian control. \u201cThe brigade has received no order to leave the city,\u201d Suspilne quoted the soldiers as saying. Vuhledar has strategic significance because of its high ground and location near the junction of the two main fronts, in eastern and southern Ukraine. The popular war blog DeepState reported that Russian forces held Vuhledar and had hoisted Russian flags throughout. Footage online showed Russian soldiers waving a flag from atop a bombed-out multi-storey building and unfurling another flag on a metal spire. Reuters said it had matched the footage to street patterns of Vuhledar. Russia\u2019s plan to hike defence spending next year \u201cis an outrage\u201d, 80-year-old pensioner Irina told Agence France-Presse in Moscow on Tuesday. \u201cWe need to end this war, and spending the budget on war is a crime.\u201d Russia is to spend more than 40% of its total budget on defence and security \u2013 more than the money allocated for social welfare and education combined. \u201cThere is not enough for anything at all. Not for treatment, not for anything,\u201d said another Irina, 70, who complained her pension was only 25,000 rubles (US$260) a month. \u201cIt\u2019s pennies. People are unprotected. It\u2019s a shame and a disgrace that the country has no money to treat its own children.\u201d Another pensioner, Elena, 68, told AFP: \u201cThe population of the country does not live so well \u2026 I am generally against military action of any kind, in any country, in ours, and in general the whole world.\u201d Some in Moscow were supportive of the budget plans. \u201cIf it is not to the detriment of education, medicine, some other social programmes \u2026 In the current situation, an increase in the amount of funding is understandable,\u201d said 49-year-old lawyer Vladimir. Another Vladimir, 50, told AFP: \u201cIn the current times, it is necessary to spend money on defence, because Nato is playing against us. We have to do something and we can\u2019t do it any other way.\u201d Authorities in Ukraine have launched an investigation into what they said was an apparent summary execution by Russian troops of 16 Ukrainian soldiers who had surrendered on the eastern frontline. Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said the alleged war crime, shown in video footage, took place on the Pokrovsk front. An apparent Russian artillery strike hit a market in the southern Ukraine city of Kherson on Tuesday, killing at least six people and wounding three others, authorities said, on a morning when people were observing a minute\u2019s silence for their military and war dead. Across Ukraine on Tuesday, traffic stopped and people on sidewalks came to a halt at 9am to commemorate those defending Ukraine and those who have sacrificed their lives. People gathered at Independence Square in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, carrying pictures of fallen soldiers. Angelina Stashenko held a portrait of her 30-year-old brother, Denys Stashenko, who was killed in action in May in the Donetsk region. His mother, Halyna Stashenko, said: \u201cI hope future generations will never forget the price our loved ones paid for their freedom \u2026 I hope Ukraine\u2019s future will be bright.\u201d Volodymyr Zelenskyy used the occasion to appeal for further support from western allies: \u201cThe daily Russian terror, the daily attempts to destroy life \u2013 all this can be stopped. Ukrainian strength and the determination of our partners must be greater than Putin\u2019s desire to spread terror.\u201d Zelenskyy hailed Ukraine\u2019s \u201cnew defence industry\u201d that has ramped up production to help fight the Russian invasion. \u201cIn the first half of this year alone, Ukraine produced 25 times more ammunition for artillery and mortars than in the whole of 2022,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s president told a defence forum in Kyiv. Almost 300 weapons companies, both Ukrainian and foreign, were in Kyiv for the conference, Zelenskyy said. \u201cIn the extremely difficult conditions of a full-scale war, under constant Russian attacks, Ukrainians were able to build a virtually new defence industry. Today, everyone can see this new Ukrainian capability.\u201d Zelenskyy said Ukraine had built up the capacity to produce four million drones a year. While much attention has focused on the billions of dollars in military aid from western backers, Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Denys Shmygal, has told a government meeting that half of the ammunition Ukraine uses at the front is produced domestically. Alongside long-range drones, Ukraine also makes the Neptune anti-ship missiles that have been used to hit Russian vessels in the Black Sea. At the end of August, Zelenskyy announced the successful test firing of the first Ukrainian-made ballistic missile. Russia is suspected of deliberately leaking chemical waste into a Ukrainian river, with deadly consequences for wildlife, write Luke Harding and Artem Mazhulin from Slabyn, Ukraine. A toxic slick was detected on 17 August coming from the Russian border village of Tyotkino. According to Kyiv, chemical waste from a sugar factory had been dumped in vast quantities into the Seym river. The pollution crossed the international border just over a mile away and made its way into the Desna river of Ukraine\u2019s Sumy region where mass die-offs of fish, molluscs and crayfish have resulted."

            "content": "At least four people died in overnight Russian bombing of Kharkiv, its mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said on Tuesday morning. The deaths took place in the Osnovianskyi district, he said. Earlier, a Russian guided bomb attack on Kharkiv on Monday shattered much of the Derzhprom building, one of the most celebrated landmarks in Ukraine\u2019s second city, dating from the 1920s and noted by Unesco. Six people were injured in the 9pm strike, adding to 13 wounded in an earlier overnight bomb attack on the city. Eight were hurt in a rocket attack in the city of Chuhuiv just to the south-east, officials said. Two people were injured and a residential building caught on fire in Kyiv\u2019s Solomianskyi district after a Russian drone attack, the mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Tuesday morning. The Sviatoshynskyi district in Kyiv\u2019s west was also hit. In the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, a Russian missile struck a three-storey residential building, killing one person and wounding at least 11 on Monday. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine\u2019s president, deplored the attack on his home town, as well as on Kharkiv, and called for renewed efforts to force Vladimir Putin to halt the war. In the southern Kherson region, a drone attack killed a medic on Monday, the regional governor said. Another three people were killed in Kherson region on Sunday. The Russian army advanced 478 sq km into Ukrainian territory in October, a record since March 2022 in the first weeks of the war, according to an AFP analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Two-thirds of the Russian gains that the news agency calculated were in the eastern Donetsk region. Russian forces are a few kilometres from Pokrovsk, which they are approaching from the south and east. They have also gained territory at the north of the front, having seized more than 40 sq km near Kupiansk. North Korea\u2019s foreign minister, Choe Son Hui, left Pyongyang on Monday to visit Russia, state media KCNA said on Tuesday. It came as the Nato chief, Mark Rutte, said after a briefing with South Korean intelligence officials that he could confirm North Korean military units had been deployed in Russia\u2019s western Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops occupy territory. He called the involvement of Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime \u201ca dangerous expansion of Russia\u2019s war\u201d and \u201ca sign of Putin\u2019s growing desperation\u201d. Zelenskyy on Monday said he expected 12,000 North Korean soldiers on Russian territory \u201csoon\u201d as he met with Nordic leaders in Iceland. He warned that about 3,000 North Korean soldiers and officers were \u201calready on Russian territory\u201d and Russia would use them in its war on Ukraine. The Pentagon said North Korea has sent 10,000 troops to eastern Russia, up from its previous estimate of 3,000. The US president, Joe Biden, called the situation \u201cvery dangerous\u201d. Matthew Miller, US state department spokesman, said Washington had also made clear to China \u201cthat we are concerned about it and that they ought to be concerned about this destabilising action by two of its neighbours, Russia and North Korea\u201d. Britain on Monday imposed sanctions on three Russian agencies and three senior figures at the agencies who it said were trying to use disinformation to \u201cundermine and destabilise Ukraine and its democracy\u201d. Britain\u2019s foreign ministry said the Social Design Agency and its partner company Structura had attempted to deliver a series of \u201cinterference operations\u201d designed to weaken international support for Ukraine. Croatia will buy up to 50 Leopard tanks from Germany in a transaction that includes sending some of its older tanks and other military equipment to Ukraine, the Croatian ministry of defence said on Monday. It added that the value of the older eastern European-made tanks and equipment would be deducted from the total price for the new Leopard 2A8 tanks that Croatia will buy. Since the start of Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022, Croatia has delivered military aid worth more than \u20ac200m to Ukraine."

            "content": "A Russian hypersonic missile struck the area of Ukraine\u2019s major Starokostiantyniv airbase on Monday morning, Kyiv said. The latest strike on Starokostiantyniv in the western Khmelnytskyi region came a day after the Dutch defence minister said the Netherlands would supply Ukraine with more F-16 jets in the coming months. There were no civilian casualties and no damage to critical infrastructure, said Serhiy Tyurin, governor of Khmelnytskyi. Two Kinzhal missiles were shot down in the Kyiv region overnight into Monday, the air force said. Debris came down in three Kyiv districts, but no major damage or casualties were reported after air defences engaged incoming targets, city authorities said. Yurii Ihnat, a Ukrainian air force spokesperson, said: \u201cDespite the fact that it\u2019s getting harder, despite [Russia\u2019s] improvements and the use of new tactics, today we have two shoot-downs \u2026 They are learning from their mistakes and from our mistakes. They are improving their technology so that we are able to shoot down fewer of them.\u201d Ukrainian air defences also shot down 32 Russian drones and a further 37 were lost on military radars, suggesting they had been disabled by electronic warfare, the air force said. Kyiv said Russian attacks had killed three civilians overnight into Monday: two brothers aged 35 and 38 in the eastern region of Sumy and a 61-year-old woman in the southern Kherson region. In the city of Kherson, the governor said a Russian strike had wounded 19 people and damaged an educational facility and various residential buildings. Ukraine also said a Russian attack had killed one person and wounded seven \u2013 including children aged two and 13 \u2013 in the city of Sloviansk in Donetsk oblast. Russian forces have entered the outskirts of the eastern Ukraine frontline city of Toretsk, Ukraine\u2019s military said late on Monday, less than a week after the fall of the bastion town of Vuhledar. \u201cThe situation is unstable, fighting is taking place literally at every entrance [to the city],\u201d Anastasiia Bobovnikova, spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, told Ukraine\u2019s national broadcaster. \u201cThe Russians have entered the eastern outskirts of the city.\u201d There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry, which said earlier on Monday that its forces inflicted damage to manpower and equipment near several settlements in the area, including near Toretsk. A Russian ballistic missile hit a Palauan-flagged civilian cargo ship in the port of Odesa on Monday, killing one person, said Oleg Kiper, the head of the Odesa region, in the second such attack in recent days. \u201cA 60-year-old Ukrainian, an employee of a private cargo handling company, was killed. Five other foreign nationals were injured.\u201d A Russian missile strike also damaged a civilian Saint Kitts and Nevis-flagged vessel loaded with corn in the Ukrainian port of Pivdennyi on Sunday, Ukraine\u2019s restoration ministry said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the war was in \u201ca very important phase\u201d as the Ukrainian army works hard to hold the bigger Russian forces at bay in the east while also holding ground in Russia\u2019s Kursk border region, which it captured two months ago. Ukraine needs to \u201cput pressure on Russia in the way that\u2019s necessary for Russia to realise that the war will gain them nothing,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s president said. \u201cWe will continue to apply even greater pressure on Russia \u2013 because only through strength can we bring peace closer.\u201d Russia\u2019s defence ministry claimed the capture of Grodivka, a settlement in the Donetsk region close to the strategically important city of Pokrovsk. There was no independent confirmation. Last week, Ukraine\u2019s army said that it had withdrawn from the mining town of Vuhledar also in the Donetsk region, handing Russia one of its most significant territorial advances in weeks. A Russian court has sentenced a 72-year-old American citizen, Stephen James Hubbard, to six years and 10 months in prison after convicting him in a closed-door trial of fighting as a mercenary for Ukraine. Investigators said Hubbard, a native of Michigan, served in a Ukrainian territorial defence unit in the eastern city of Izium, where he had been living since 2014. He was captured by Russian soldiers on 2 April 2022, and pleaded guilty, said the Ria news agency, quoting the Russian prosecutor. In interviews last month, Hubbard\u2019s sister Patricia Hubbard Fox cast doubt on his reported confession, telling Reuters he held pro-Russian views and was unlikely to have taken up arms at his age. He moved to Ukraine in 2014 and lived there for a time with a Ukrainian woman, surviving off a small pension of about $300 a month. He never learned Russian or Ukrainian, and had few connections to local people, she said. The US embassy in Moscow said it was aware of the detention of an American citizen, but declined further comment on Monday. More details emerged after Ukraine confirmed attacking the Feodosia oil terminal in occupied Crimea over Sunday night, causing a huge fire that burned into Monday. Russia\u2019s defence ministry claimed 12 Ukrainian attack drones had been downed over the peninsula overnight, out of a total of 21 deployed by Kyiv against Russian targets including six over Kursk region, and others over Belgorod, Bryansk and Voronezh. A Ukrainian sabotage operation damaged a Russian minesweeping vessel in Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad region and put it out of action, Ukraine\u2019s military spy agency, the GUR, said on Monday. Water had entered the engine of the Alexander Obukhov Alexandrit-class minesweeper through \u201ca mysterious hole\u201d in a gas pipe, the GUR said. \u201cThe ship, which was based in the city of Baltiysk and was supposed to go on combat duty, was seriously damaged.\u201d There was no immediate comment from Russia. The GUR and a pro-Kyiv Russian military group claimed responsibility earlier this year for an arson attack on a Russian warship in the Baltic Sea in April. Ukraine will not extend its gas transit agreement with Russia after it expires at the end of 2024, the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has told his pro-Russian Slovakian counterpart, Robert Fico, during talks in Ukraine. Shmyhal said that Kyiv understands the \u201cacute dependence\u201d of some states including Slovakia on the Russian gas supply but \u201cUkraine\u2019s strategic goal is to deprive the Kremlin of profits from the sale of hydrocarbons which the aggressor uses to finance the war\u201d. Shmyhal said Ukraine and Slovakia had agreed on the creation of an eastern European energy hub aiming to utilise large Ukrainian gas storage facilities. Fico said Ukraine\u2019s government had confirmed it remained interested in using its gas and oil transit systems after the deal with Russia expires. Fico opposes Ukraine joining Nato but has said he supports it becoming an EU member. Russian state media company VGTRK, which owns and operates the country\u2019s main national TV stations, came under a cyber-attack on Monday that a Ukrainian government source said Kyiv\u2019s hackers had caused coinciding with Vladimir Putin\u2019s 72nd birthday. The website of VGTRK, the All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, was not loading early on Monday and its Rossiya-24 news channel was not available online. A Ukrainian government source said: \u201cUkrainian hackers \u2018congratulated\u2019 Putin on his birthday by carrying out a large-scale attack on the all-Russian state television and radio broadcasting company.\u201d The Kremlin confirmed the attack."

            "date": "2024-10-22T16:26:19Z",
            "content": "The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has arrived in Israel to encourage efforts to revive the stalled Gaza ceasefire negotiations after Israel\u2019s killing of the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, last week. Meeting the Israeli prime minister, Blinken urged Benjamin Netanyahu to capitalise on the death of the Hamas leader by securing the release of the 7 October attack hostages and ending the conflict in Gaza. A US state department spokesperson added that Blinken had also emphasised to Netanyahu on the need for Israel to boost humanitarian assistance into Gaza, during a two-and-a-half-hour meeting in Jerusalem on Tuesday. Blinken, who has made multiple fruitless trips to the region, arrived to little evidence that either Israel or Hamas were open to movement on their preconditions for a ceasefire in Gaza, where more than a year of an Israeli offensive has claimed more than 42,000 Palestinian lives. With the US election just two weeks away, the US president, Joe Biden, asked Blinken to return to press for progress, seeing new hope after Israel\u2019s killing of Sinwar With war raging in Gaza and also with Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the prospect of a widening conflict with Iran, international diplomats have struggled not only with the specific issues involved in trying to bring the individual wars to an end but also how to sequence issues related to the connected conflicts. The state department said before the visit that Blinken would focus on ending the war in Gaza, securing the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas and alleviating the suffering of Palestinian civilians. After Israel, he is expected to visit a number of Arab countries, likely to include Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Blinken\u2019s meeting came as it was confirmed that a Hezbollah drone had struck Netanyahu\u2019s house in the Israeli seaside town of Caesarea on Saturday causing physical damage to the property. Netanyahu was not at the property at the time. According to a report on the Axios website, there has been a suggestion from Egypt, a key interlocutor with Hamas, of a much-truncated ceasefire-for-hostages deal under which living Israeli hostages would be released in exchange for a ceasefire lasting a few days, in the hope that it could help break the deadlock. Israel and Hamas accused each other of making new and unacceptable demands over the summer and negotiations ground to a halt in August. The conflicts began on 7 October 2023 when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking another 250 hostage. About 100 of the captives are still held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Blinken\u2019s arrival follows hard on the heels of that of the US special envoy, Amos Hochstein, in Beirut, seeking to advance discussions on a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. The state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Blinken would underscore the need for a dramatic increase in the amount of humanitarian aid reaching Gaza, something that Blinken and the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, made clear in a letter to Israeli officials last week. That letter reminded Israel that the Biden administration could be forced by US law to curtail some forms of military aid should the delivery of humanitarian aid continue to be hindered. Blinken\u2019s previous trips yielded little in the way of ending hostilities but he has managed to increase aid deliveries to Gaza in the past. The US, Egypt and Qatar have brokered months of talks between Israel and Hamas, trying to strike a deal in which the militants would release dozens of hostages in return for an end to the war, a lasting ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners. On top of the concerns over the continued Israeli offensives in Gaza and Lebanon is the expectation that Israel will soon launch its retaliation for last month\u2019s substantial Iranian ballistic missile strike, which targeted a number of Israeli military sites in retaliation for Israel\u2019s killing of the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. With leaked US intelligence suggesting that a response might be imminent, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has been crisscrossing the region in recent days to try to build support. Speaking in Kuwait on Tuesday, he said Gulf Arab countries had assured him they would not allow their territory \u2013 including airspace \u2013 to be used for any Israeli attack. \u201cAll the neighbours assured us that they will not allow their lands and air to be used against Iran,\u201d Araghchi said, according to the state-run Irna news agency. Gulf Arab nations such as the UAE and Qatar host major military installations, and there are concerns that an all-out regional war could draw them in. Iran has repeatedly vowed to respond to any Israeli strike. Adding impetus to the calls for progress on a ceasefire on Tuesday was the UN\u2019s Palestinian refugee agency, which called for a temporary truce to allow people to leave areas of northern Gaza, as health officials said they were running out of supplies to treat patients hurt in a renewed three-week-old Israeli offensive in the north of the coastal strip. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of Unrwa, said the humanitarian situation had reached a dire point, with bodies abandoned by roadsides or buried under rubble. \u201cIn northern Gaza, people are just waiting to die. They feel deserted, hopeless and alone,\u201d he said in a statement on X. \u201cI am calling for an immediate truce, even if for a few hours, to enable safe humanitarian passage for families who wish to leave the area &amp; reach safer places.\u201d"

            "content": "It\u2019s 9.30pm in Tel Aviv, Gaza and Beirut. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments: Senior US officials have held talks in Israel aimed at brokering a ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Two senior US envoys, Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk, met Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to talk about a ceasefire proposal for Lebanon. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said negotiators made \u201cgood progress\u201d toward a deal. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that we will see things transition in Lebanon in a not too distant future,\u201d US defense secretary Lloyd Austin said. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, who had expressed optimism of a speedy settlement \u201cin hours or days\u201d earlier on Thursday, said that Israel\u2019s \u201congoing escalation\u201d in his country \u201cdoes not inspire optimism\u201d. Netanyahu\u2019s office said the prime minister \u201cmade it clear that the main point is not this or that agreement on paper but Israel\u2019s ability and determination to enforce the agreement and thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon, in a manner that will return our residents securely to their homes\u201d. Thursday marked a day when more civilians in both Israel and Lebanon were killed since October 2023. The Lebanese health ministry said that Israeli attacks had killed 45 people in the previous 24 hours, amid bombing in the north-east Bekaa valley and infantry battles in the south. In one Bekaa village, eight people were killed from the same family. In northern Israel, seven people were killed by rocket fire from Lebanon, including four Thai agricultural workers. The Israeli army\u2019s evacuation call for several areas of south Lebanon on Thursday included a Palestinian refugee camp. Among the areas listed was Rashidieh camp, which houses thousands of Palestinian refugees. Israel issued its second evacuation order for the city of Baalbek and two surrounding villages in the Bekaa valley on Thursday afternoon, carrying out a series of airstrikes on the village of Durous a few hours later. The evacuation orders had prompted a mass exodus of residents from the city, which is home to a Unesco world heritage site. Israeli attacks killed at least one child in Lebanon each day and injured 10 others, the UN children\u2019s agency (Unicef) said. Citing the Lebanese health ministry, Unicef said 166 children have been killed since October 2023, while at least 1,168 have been injured. It awrned that the war in Lebanon is \u201cinflicting severe physical wounds and deep emotional scars\u201d on many of the country\u2019s children. Six Lebanese health workers were killed and four wounded in Israeli strikes across south Lebanon on Thursday, the health ministry said in a statement. Israel\u2019s military offensive in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 43,204 Palestinians and injured 101,641 since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said on Thursday. The toll includes 41 deaths in the previous 24 hours, according to the ministry. Palestinian authorities said three people had been killed in an Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank on Thursday. The Israeli army said it was targeting militants in the Nur Shams refugee camp in the West Bank city of Tulkarem, and had killed a Hamas militant who was involved in planning attacks. Israeli strikes killed five civilians on Syria\u2019s Qusayr region near the border with Lebanon, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based war monitor said the strikes targeted Qusayr, a town where Hezbollah operate. One strike targeted \u201ca weapons depot and a fuel storage facility for Hezbollah in the industrial city of Qusayr\u201d, killing five civilians, the Observatory said. A senior Hamas official said the group rejects any proposal for a temporary halt to more than a year of fighting in Gaza and insists on a lasting ceasefire. Mediators seeking to broker a Gaza ceasefire are expected to propose a truce of \u201cless than a month\u201d to Hamas, a source with knowledge of the talks told AFP on Wednesday. The UN should consider suspending Israel as a member state due to its continuing \u201cgenocide\u201d against the Palestinians, the divisive special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, has said. The comments on Thursday came a day after she published her latest report alleging that Israel was not just committing war crimes or crimes against humanity in Gaza, but a genocide. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned Israel could carry out the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of Gaza if the international community does not make a determined stand to prevent it. \u201cThe intention might be for the Palestinians to leave Gaza, for others to occupy it,\u201d Guterres told the Guardian. \u201cBut there has been \u2013 and I pay tribute to the courage and the resilience of the Palestinian people and to the determination of the Arab world \u2013 [an effort] to avoid the ethnic cleansing becoming a reality.\u201d A Palestinian student who was stripped of her UK student visa after remarks she made about the Israel-Gaza war has won a human rights appeal against the Home Office\u2019s decision. Israeli intelligence suggests that Iran is preparing to attack Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days, according to an Axios report. The attack may take place before the US presidential election on 5 November, the outlet said, citing two Israeli sources. The attack is expected to be carried out from Iraq using a large number of drones and ballistic missiles, the sources said. As we reported earlier, two senior US officials, Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk, met with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier on Thursday. The meetings were described as \u201csubstantive and constructive and focused on a number of issues in depth, including Iran, Lebanon, Gaza, and securing the release of hostages,\u201d a US official told the Times of Israel. The official said: There was a particular focus on efforts to secure a ceasefire deal in Lebanon that allows people on both sides of the Blue Line to return safely to their homes as well as new initiatives to secure the release of hostages, which Hamas must do without delay. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said negotiators have made \u201cgood progress\u201d toward a deal that would bring a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Washington was \u201cworking very hard\u201d on concluding arrangements on a deal that would include Hezbollah\u2019s withdrawal from the border region with Israel, Blinken said on Thursday, AFP reported. Blinken said: Based on my recent trip to the region, and the work that\u2019s ongoing right now, we have made good progress on those understandings. \u201cWe still have more work to do,\u201d he said, calling for a \u201cdiplomatic resolution, including through a ceasefire.\u201d Blinken also called for the \u201ceffective implementation\u201d of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which would calls for the disarmament of non-state groups in Lebanon and a full Israeli withdrawal from the country. The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, speaking alongside Blinken, said there was an \u201copportunity\u201d in Lebanon. Austin said: We\u2019re hopeful that we will see things transition in Lebanon in a not too distant future. The UN should consider suspending Israel as a member state due to its continuing \u201cgenocide\u201d against the Palestinians, the divisive special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories has said. Francesca Albanese was speaking to a UN committee on the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people in New York the day after she published her latest report alleging that Israel was not just committing war crimes or crimes against humanity in Gaza, but a genocide. \u201cIt is time to consider suspending the credentials of Israel as a member state of the UN,\u201d she said. I understand the sensitivity because none of you have clean hands when it comes to human rights. She added that no other country had defied so many UN resolutions for so long. In her report, Albanese claimed: Israel has pursued a pattern of conduct \u2018deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction\u2019. She is a divisive UN rapporteur, and was prevented from holding a briefing at the US Congress this week. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, described her in a tweet as unfit for office, adding: The United Nations should not tolerate antisemitism from a UN-affiliated official hired to promote human rights. Read the full story here: UN should consider suspending Israel over \u2018genocide\u2019 against Palestinians, says special rapporteur Israeli attacks killed 45 people in Lebanon in the past 24 hours, according to the latest update from the Lebanese health ministry on Thursday. It brings the total death toll in Lebanon from Israeli attacks to 2,865 since October 2023, it said. Separately, the UN children\u2019s agency (Unicef) warned that the war in Lebanon is \u201cinflicting severe physical wounds and deep emotional scars\u201d on many of the country\u2019s children. Citing the Lebanese health ministry, Unicef said 166 children have been killed since October 2023, while at least 1,168 have been injured. It said: Since October 4th of this year, at least one child has been killed and 10 injured daily. Thousands more children who have survived the many months of constant bombings physically unscathed, are now acutely distressed by the violence and chaos around them. The agency said its teams have met children \u201cgripped by overwhelming fear and increased anxiety\u201d who are \u201chaunted by nightmares, headaches, and loss of appetite\u201d. \u201cWar tears apart the safe and nurturing environments children need,\u201d it said, adding that children who are \u201cforced to endure prolonged periods of traumatic stress\u201d will face \u201csevere health and psychological risks\u201d that can last a lifetime. The European Union condemned \u201cany attempt to abrogate the 1967 agreement between Israel and UNRWA or to otherwise attempt to obstruct its capacity to operate its mandate\u201d. The comments followed Israel\u2019s decision to adopt two controversial bills banning the UN agency for Palestinian refugees from operating inside occupied Israeli territory. \u201cIf implemented, the laws will have far-reaching consequences, stopping all UNRWA\u2019s operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, de facto preventing UNRWA\u2019s vital operations in Gaza hampering UNRWA\u2019s provision of health, education and social services in the West Bank and revoking UNRWA\u2019s diplomatic privileges and immunities in Israel,\u201d said a EU statement. \u201cAs long as there is no sustainable solution to the conflict, the mandate of UNRWA will remain vital.\u201d The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said five civilians were killed Thursday in Israeli strikes on Syria\u2019s Qusayr region near the border with Lebanon, where Israel said it hit Hezbollah weapons depots. The Britain-based war monitor said the strikes targeted Qusayr, a town where Hezbollah operate. One strike targeted \u201ca weapons depot and a fuel storage facility for Hezbollah in the industrial city of Qusayr\u201d, killing five civilians, the Observatory said. The other strikes targeted warehouses and bridges according to the war monitor. The Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesman Avichay Adraee said \u201cweapons depots and headquarters used by\u201d Hezbollah were hit in the Qusayr region. Adraee said the strikes sought to thwart attempts to \u201ctransfer weapons from Iran via Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon\u201d. A chief medical official at Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza has described catastrophic conditions at the facility. \u201cThe hospital has no medical teams \u2013 doctors, surgeons, orthopaedics. More than 33 people, between doctors and nurses, have also been arrested,\u201d Eid Sabbah, the director of nursing at the hospital, told Al Jazeera. The IDF has destroyed oxygen and electricity stations, the hospital\u2019s main water pump and ambulances, Sabbah said. \u201cThe things that we have are things that can\u2019t keep people alive,\u201d he said. Over a hundred wounded patients are still in dire need inside the facility, but only three doctors remain on site, including junior doctors who aren\u2019t qualified to operate. Five days ago, a delegation from the World Health Organization brought a small amount of fuel for the generators to operate and some medical supplies, but \u201cimmediately after the delegation left the hospital on the same night, the Israeli army stormed the hospital, destroyed a lot of things inside, destroyed the medical supplies that we had received,\u201d he said. The Times of Israeli is reporting that the Israeli man killed alongside four foreign nationals by a Hezbollah rocket near Metula today was a 47-year-old called Omer Weinstein and he was a father of four. \u201cThe agreements, the papers, the proposals, the numbers [UN Security Council Resolution] 1509, 1701 \u2014 all these have their place, but they are not the main thing,\u201d he says, hours after meeting and making a similar point to top White House Middle East aides. \u201cThe main thing is our ability and our determination to enforce security, to thwart attacks against us and to act against the arming of our enemies as much as is necessary despite all the pressures and constraints \u2014 that is the main thing.\u201d Turning to address Iran, the prime minister says: \u201cThe brash words of the leaders of the regime in Iran cannot cover up the fact that Israel has greater freedom of action in Iran today than ever before. We can reach anywhere in Iran as needed.\u201d Netanyahu adds that the fight against the Iranian axis is guided by the \u201ctotal victory concept,\u201d but he stopped short of predicting when the war would end. In regards to the remaining hostages kept in Gaza by Hamas, the prime minister says that over half have returned home and they are working on securing safety for the rest, but says these negotiations will be kept behind the scenes. Acute food insecurity is expected to worsen in war-stricken Sudan and nearly two dozen other countries and territories in the next six months, largely as a result of conflict and violence, an analysis by the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization and World Food Programme has found. The latest edition of the twice-yearly Hunger Hotspots report, published on Thursday, provides early warnings on food crises and situations around the world where food insecurity is likely to worsen, with a focus on the most severe and deteriorating situations of acute hunger. An 18-month conflict has driven hunger in Sudan by disrupting food systems, causing displacement, and blocking access for humanitarian support. Weather extremes, such as floods, have also played a role in worsening food insecurity\u2026 Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told visiting US envoy Amos Hochstein and US Middle East adviser Brett McGurk that any ceasefire deal with Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah would have to guarantee Israeli security. \u201cThe prime minister specified that the main issue is not paperwork for this or that deal, but Israel\u2019s determination and capacity to ensure the deal\u2019s application and to prevent any threat to its security from Lebanon,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office said after the meeting in Jerusalem. Lebanese official media reported Israeli strikes near Baalbek on Thursday, after Israel issued evacuation warnings for the main eastern city for the second day in a row. \u201cEnemy aircraft launched four strikes on the village of Douris and the surroundings of the city of Baalbek,\u201d the National News Agency said. On 1 July 2024, the European hospital in Gaza evacuated all patients and staff. On that day I should have been shoulder to shoulder with my colleagues. I should have been tending gravely injured patients. I should have been helping them to flee. On ventilators, hooked up to IV fluids, on gurneys, in and out of consciousness and clinging to life, they had done nothing to deserve their situation, and they deserved my help. Instead, I watched from my home in Texas and read messages from the other medics, as an overcrowded hospital transformed into a ghost town. With anguish, I witnessed the tragedy unfold from afar. A week earlier, I had been in Jordan with the rest of my team, preparing to cross into Gaza for our humanitarian mission. However, less than 48 hours before we attempted the Rafah border crossing, the Israeli military refused my entry \u201cdue to Palestinian roots\u201d\u2026 It has just gone 5pm in Gaza City, Tel Aviv and Beirut. Here is a summary of the latest developments: Senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told Agence France-Press (AFP) that the group rejected the idea of a short-term pause in the fighting mooted by US and Qatari mediators. Mediators had hoped that a short pause would create a window to bring in humanitarian aid to Gaza\u2019s desperate civilian population and to negotiate a permanent ceasefire. \u201cThe idea of a temporary pause in the war, only to resume aggression later, is something we have already expressed our position on. Hamas supports a permanent end to the war, not a temporary one,\u201d he said. Senior US officials were to meet their Israeli counterparts on Thursday to discuss a possible deal to end the conflict in Lebanon and secure Israel\u2019s northern border from Hezbollah attacks. On Wednesday, Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati expressed optimism about a ceasefire in \u201cthe coming hours or days\u201d and Hezbollah\u2019s new leader Naim Qassem said the group would accept a truce under certain conditions. A rocket barrage fired by Hezbollah at Israel\u2019s north has killed five people, including an Israeli farmer and four Thai labourers. The incident occurred near the frontline near the border community of Metula, whose citizens largely evacuated close to a year ago and which sits in a closed military zone. Six Lebanese health workers were killed and four injured in Israeli strikes across south Lebanon on Thursday, the health ministry said in a statement. The Israeli army\u2019s evacuation call for several areas of south Lebanon on Thursday, included a Palestinian refugee camp. It warned it was poised to hit Hezbollah targets in those areas. Among the areas listed was Rashidieh camp, which houses thousands of Palestinian refugees. A Lebanese security source said one person was killed on Thursday by an Israeli strike on a road where a Hezbollah van carrying munitions was hit the previous day. The drone strike hit the Araya-Kahhale road which links the capital Beirut to Lebanon\u2019s eastern Bekaa valley, the source told AFP, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. It targeted a Mercedes vehicle, killing the driver, the source said, without identifying the victim. Also on Thursday, an Israeli drone strike hit a motorbike near the coastal town of Naqura, the official National News Agency (NNA) reported. Another motorbike was hit in the eastern Bekaa valley, it added. The United Nations children\u2019s agency said the Israel-Hezbollah war has seen one child die a day in Lebanon over the past month. \u201cSince October 4 of this year, at least one child has been killed and 10 injured daily,\u201d Unicef said, adding that \u201cthe ongoing war in Lebanon is upending children\u2019s lives\u201d. Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the war effort depends on the economy ahead of Israel\u2019s 2025 state budget. He said: \u201cWe cannot have a strong army if we have no way to finance it. Therefore, security depends on the economy, but the economy also depends on security. If there is an ability to damage our cities, our industry, then obviously our economic capacity would be affected.\u201d The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has warned Israel could carry out the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of Gaza if the international community does not make a determined stand to prevent it. Guterres made his appeal at a time of mounting civilian casualties from the Israeli bombardment of northern Gaza. A strike on Tuesday in Beit Lahiya district killed at least 93 people, in what the UN said was just one of at least seven \u201cmass casualty incidents\u201d across Gaza in the past week. A surge in hostilities in the Gaza Strip has raised concerns that the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d of famine will materialise, UN food agencies warned on Thursday. A report by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme estimated that 41% of the population, or 876,000 people, will face \u201cemergency\u201d levels of hunger from November until the end of April. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three people were killed on Thursday in Israeli strikes on Syria\u2019s Qusayr region near the border with Lebanon, where Israel said it hit Hezbollah weapons depots. One strike targeted \u201ca weapons depot and a fuel storage facility for Hezbollah in the industrial city of Qusayr\u201d, killing three and injuring five others, the Syrian Observatory said. The other strikes targeted warehouses near the Lebanese border and a bridge south of Qusayr, it added. Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee said \u201cweapons depots and headquarters used by\u201d Hezbollah were hit in the Qusayr region. Adraee said the strikes sought to thwart attempts to \u201ctransfer weapons from Iran via Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon\u201d. Only two doctors are still serving at the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza after raids by Israeli forces and the detention of medical staff, aid groups say. Mahmoud Shalabi, deputy director of programmes for the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, said there were only two doctors and 70 nurses working in a hospital that would usually have 500 medical staff. Medical charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said it had confirmed its employee, orthopaedic surgeon, Mohammed Obeid, was detained during a military operation on 26 October. US state department officials have identified nearly 500 potential incidents of civilian harm during Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza involving US-furnished weapons, but have not taken further action on any of them, according to three sources, including a US official familiar with the matter. Israeli police said on Thursday they had arrested an Israeli couple on suspicion of spying for Iran, barely a week after two groups allegedly working for Tehran were detained. \u201cThe thwarting of Iran\u2019s efforts to recruit Israelis continues,\u201d said a statement from the police and Israel\u2019s internal security agency, Shin Bet. The Irish peace-keeping force\u2019s base in Lebanon has been hit by a rocket, suspected to have been fired by Hezbollah. Nobody was injured, the chief of staff of the Irish Defence Force said on Thursday after a briefing with the foreign minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin. Lt Gen Sean Clancy said it had struck an unoccupied part of Camp Shamrock, 7km from the Israeli border. Three Palestinians were killed in Israeli military operations in the occupied West Bank city of Tulkarem overnight, the health ministry and an official said on Thursday. The Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry reported \u201ctwo martyrs in Nur Shams camp in Tulkarem due to the occupation\u2019s shelling\u201d. The ministry on Wednesday evening reported another death in the area, saying \u201ca martyr shot by the occupation arrived at Thabet Thabet Tulkarem government hospital\u201d. The Israeli military said its soldiers had \u201cbeen operating as part of a counter-terrorism operation in the area of Nur Shams\u201d along with police and the Shin Bet security agency. On Thursday, army said in a statement that it had \u201celiminated the terrorist Hussam Mallah\u201d, whom it identified as an important member of Hamas in the area. At least 43,204 Palestinians have been killed by Israel\u2019s military offensive in the Gaza Strip, and 101,641 injured, since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said on Thursday. The toll includes 41 deaths in the previous 24 hours. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, under pressure from US treasury secretary Janet Yellen, will sign a waiver to extend cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian banks for another month after the cabinet agreed, his spokesperson said on Thursday. Israel\u2019s military said on Thursday it shot down a drone smuggling weapons from Egyptian territory to Israel on Wednesday. Israeli officials have said during the war in Gaza that Hamas used tunnels running under the border into Egypt\u2019s Sinai region to smuggle arms. However, Egypt says it destroyed tunnel networks leading to Gaza years ago and created a buffer zone and border fortifications that prevent smuggling. A Palestinian student who was stripped of her student visa after remarks she made about the Israel-Gaza war has won a human rights appeal against the UK Home Office\u2019s decision. Dana Abu Qamar, 20, came to the attention of authorities after statements made at a university demonstration on Gaza\u2019s historical resistance to Israel\u2019s \u201coppressive regime\u201d and a subsequent interview with Sky News. Israeli emergency services said a rocket launched from Lebanon killed two people in an olive grove in northern Israel on Thursday, bringing the day\u2019s toll to seven dead, reports Agence France-Presse. Medics \u201ctreated and attempted resuscitation on a 30-year-old male and a 60-year-old female, who were then pronounced dead. A 71-year-old male with mild shrapnel injuries to his limbs was evacuated,\u201d the Magen David Adom first responders said in a statement. Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, under pressure from US treasury secretary Janet Yellen, will sign a waiver to extend cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian banks for another month after the cabinet agreed, his spokesperson said on Thursday, reports Reuters. Smotrich in June extended a waiver that allows cooperation between Israel\u2019s banking system and Palestinian banks in the West Bank, but only for four months until the end of October. The waiver allows Israeli banks to process shekel payments for services and salaries tied to the Palestinian Authority without the risk of being charged with money laundering and funding terrorism. Without it, Palestinian banks would be cut off from the Israeli financial system. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three people were killed on Thursday in Israeli strikes on Syria\u2019s Qusayr region near the border with Lebanon, where Israel said it hit Hezbollah weapons depots. The UK-based war monitor said three strikes targeted the town of Qusayr and surrounding areas. One strike targeted \u201ca weapons depot and a fuel storage facility for Hezbollah in the industrial city of Qusayr\u201d, killing three and injuring five others, the Syrian Observatory said. The other strikes targeted warehouses near the Lebanese border and a bridge south of Qusayr, according to the war monitor. Agence France-Presse reports that the Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee said \u201cweapons depots and headquarters used by\u201d Hezbollah were hit in the Qusayr region. Adraee said the strikes sought to thwart attempts to \u201ctransfer weapons from Iran via Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon\u201d. The state news agency, Sana, reported Israeli strikes on Qusayr\u2019s industrial zone and some residential neighbourhoods, saying they caused material damage. The Irish peace-keeping force\u2019s base in Lebanon has been hit by a rocket, suspected to have been fired by Hezbollah. Nobody was injured, the chief of staff of the Irish Defence Force said on Thursday after a briefing with the foreign minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin. Lt Gen Sean Clancy said it had struck an unoccupied part of Camp Shamrock, 7km from the Israeli border. The assessment was that the rocket, which was Russian made, \u201cwas travelling from north to south into Israel\u201d. There have been about 30 attacks on UN peacekeeping force bases in the blue buffer zone between Lebanon and Israel of which 20 have been attributed to the Israel Defense Forces, Unifil spokesperson Andrea Tenenti said yesterday. Israel\u2019s military offensive in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 43,204 Palestinians and injured 101,641 since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said on Thursday. The toll includes 41 deaths in the previous 24 hours, according to the ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Only two doctors are still serving at the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza after raids by Israeli forces and the detention of medical staff, aid groups say. Medical charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said it has confirmed its employee, orthopaedic surgeon, Mohammed Obeid, was detained during a military operation on 26 October. MSF said: Dr Obeid has been working tirelessly since the beginning of the war, offering his support as a doctor to multiple hospitals in Gaza. His work has saved countless lives. We call for the safety and the protection of our colleague, and for all medical staff in Gaza who work under impossible conditions and are facing horrific violence as they try to provide care.\u201d The hospital is struggling to deal with an influx of casualties after recent Israeli operations in the Beit Lahia area of Gaza, including a strike on a block of flats that killed 93 people on Tuesday. Mahmoud Shalabi, deputy director of programmes for the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, said there were only two doctors and 70 nurses working in a hospital that would usually have 500 medical staff. \u201cThat place is the only place right now that is still barely functioning with very minimum resources,\u201d said Shalabi. He added: Every now and then the United Nations go and manage to evacuate around 20 patients every, like, three days, and they bring them to Gaza City \u2026 [but] there is no space to host those patients coming from the north or from any new massacre that is happening in Gaza City.\u201d The Palestinian ministry of health said Kamal Adwan hospital had been subject to \u201crepeated attacks\u201d by Israel, including a strike on Thursday that hit the hospital\u2019s third floor, which they said damaged medical stocks. Three Palestinians were killed in Israeli military operations in the occupied West Bank city of Tulkarem overnight, the health ministry and an official said on Thursday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry reported \u201ctwo martyrs in Nur Shams camp in Tulkarem due to the occupation\u2019s shelling\u201d. Rami Alyan of the camp\u2019s popular service committee told AFP the Israeli army raided Nur Shams camp in the northern West Bank city at 2am, local time. \u201cThe occupation forces are still conducting bulldozing operations in the streets of the camp, and there are injuries,\u201d he said. The two killed were a 16-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man, he added. According to AFP, the Israeli military said its soldiers had \u201cbeen operating as part of a counter-terrorism operation in the area of Nur Shams\u201d along with police and the Shin Bet security agency. The air force \u201cstruck an armed terrorist cell that fired at the forces\u201d during the operation, the statement added. The Palestinian health ministry on Wednesday evening reported another death in the area, saying \u201ca martyr shot by the occupation arrived at Thabet Thabet Tulkarem government hospital\u201d. The official Palestinian news agency Wafa said a 30-year-old man, Hossam Mallah, was killed in Tulkarem camp, the city\u2019s other refugee camp, by \u201ca special force that infiltrated the camp with a taxi and van\u201d. The army said in its Thursday statement that it had \u201celiminated the terrorist Hussam Mallah\u201d, whom it identified as an important member of Hamas in the area \u201cwho was involved in the planning of terrorist attacks within an immediate time frame\u201d. From a few points on the periphery between Israel and Gaza, it is possible to see the bombed-out ruins of the besieged Palestinian territory; every so often, the boom and thud of airstrikes and artillery fire send plumes of grey and white smoke into the wide autumn sky. For most onlookers, the scene is apocalyptic - but for rightwing Israelis who want to resettle the strip, it\u2019s a promising new horizon. Once dismissed as the pipe dream of fringe extremists, the idea is gaining momentum thanks to Israel\u2019s military success in Gaza, and political support from Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition. Last week, near Be\u2019eri, a border kibbutz devastated by the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023, the pro-settlement organisation Nachala held a \u201cPreparing to Resettle Gaza\u201d conference, laying out its vision for the strip\u2019s future. The event was given a green light by the Israeli military despite the fact the area is still technically a closed military zone. Several hundred people showed up, including government ministers and Knesset members\u2026 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war effort depends on the economy ahead of Israel\u2019s 2025 state budget. \u201cWe cannot have a strong army if we have no way to finance it. Therefore, security depends on the economy, but the economy also depends on security. If there is an ability to damage our cities, our industry, then obviously our economic capacity would be affected.\u201d Netanyahu claims the Israeli economy has been \u201csurprisingly resilient\u201d during the last year of war. The prime minister did caution that there would be cuts elsewhere. \u201cIf you give to one place, you unfortunately have to take from another place,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are ways to do this.\u201d Our correspondent Peter Beaumont has more detail on the attack which killed five people in northern Israel (see post at 11.31GMT). A rocket barrage fired by Hezbollah at Israel\u2019s north has killed five people, including an Israeli farmer and four Thai labourers. The incident occurred near the front line near the border community of Metula, whose citizens largely evacuated close to a year ago and which sits in a closed military zone. Despite large scale evacuations of northern Israel some agricultural activity has continued in rural areas despite the rocket fire. The deaths come as Hezbollah has shifted back to concentrating most (although not all) of its fire in a 7-10 kilometre area closest to the border. Six Lebanese health workers were killed and four wounded in Israeli strikes across south Lebanon on Thursday, the health ministry said in a statement. Meanwhile, The United Nations children\u2019s agency says the Israel-Hezbollah war has seen one child die a day in Lebanon over the past month. \u201cSince October 4 of this year, at least one child has been killed and 10 injured daily,\u201d UNICEF said, adding that \u201cthe ongoing war in Lebanon is upending children\u2019s lives.\u201d Diplomatic efforts are also under way to agree a short halt to fighting in Gaza. But on Thursday, senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told Agence France-Press (AFP) that the group rejected the idea of a short-term pause in the fighting mooted by US and Qatari mediators. Mediators had hoped that a short pause would create a window to bring in humanitarian aid to Gaza\u2019s desperate civilian population and to negotiate a permanent ceasefire, but Hamas rejected this, reports AFP. \u201cThe idea of a temporary pause in the war, only to resume aggression later, is something we have already expressed our position on. Hamas supports a permanent end to the war, not a temporary one,\u201d Nunu said. Any deal to stabilise Israel\u2019s front with Lebanon is likely to come first, ahead of any ceasefire for Gaza, reports AFP. Last week, Israel\u2019s chief of general staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said: In the north, there\u2019s a possibility of reaching a sharp conclusion.\u201d In his first speech since taking over, Qassem said Hezbollah could continue to resist Israeli air and ground attacks in Lebanon for months, but he also opened the door to a negotiated truce if presented with an Israeli offer. \u201cIf the Israelis decide that they want to stop the aggression, we say we accept, but under the conditions that we see as appropriate and suitable,\u201d he said. Senior US officials were to meet their Israeli counterparts on Thursday to discuss a possible deal to end the conflict in Lebanon and secure Israel\u2019s northern border from Hezbollah attacks. The US visit came as Hamas rejected separate truce plans proposed for the fighting in Gaza (see 10.32am GMT), where Israeli strikes continued overnight, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Less than a week before the US presidential election, Washington\u2019s envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk were expected in Israel. Israeli forces continued their fierce ground and air campaign against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. On Wednesday, Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati expressed optimism about a ceasefire in \u201cthe coming hours or days\u201d and Hezbollah\u2019s new leader Naim Qassem said the group would accept a truce under certain conditions. According to Israeli media reports citing government sources, the plan brokered by the US team would see Hezbollah forces retreat about 20 miles (30 kilometres) from the border, north of the Litani river, reports AFP. Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and the Lebanese army would then take charge of the border, alongside UN peacekeepers. Lebanon would be responsible for preventing Hezbollah from rearming itself with imported weapons, and Israel would retain its rights under international law to act in self-defence. Five people were killed, including four foreign workers and one Israeli farmer, in a Hezbollah attack on Israel\u2019s northern town of Metula on Thursday, reports Reuters, citing Israel\u2019s Channel 12. UN food agencies warned on Thursday of deadly hunger levels in 16 \u201chunger hotspots\u201d in coming months, with the Palestinian territories, Sudan and South Sudan, Mali and Haiti of most concern, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Conflict is driving most of the acute food insecurity in all those areas analysed by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme. Extreme weather was a major factor in other regions, while economic inequality and high debt in many developing countries are hurting governments\u2019 capacity to react, according to the joint report covering forecasts for November 2024 to May 2025. Humanitarian action was urgently needed to prevent starvation and death in the Palestinian territories, Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti and Mali, said the report, based on research by experts from the two Rome-based United Nations agencies, reports AFP. \u201cWithout immediate humanitarian efforts and concerted international action to address severe access constraints and advocate for the de-escalation of conflict and insecurity, further starvation and loss of life are likely\u201d in those spots, it found. Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, along with Nigeria, Chad, Mozambique and Myanmar, are of \u201cvery high concern\u201d, it said. In all those countries, conflict was either a major driver of hunger, or a contributor. A surge in hostilities in the Gaza Strip has raised concerns that the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d of famine will materialise, said the report. According to AFP, it estimated that 41% of the population, or 876,000 people, will face \u201cemergency\u201d levels of hunger from November until the end of April. Nearly 16%, or 345,000 people, will experience the most serious \u201ccatastrophic\u201d levels. As of mid-October, 1.9 million people in Gaza have been displaced, it said. Conflict forces people to flee their homes, \u201cdisrupting livelihoods and income, limiting market access, and resulting in price fluctuations and erratic food production and consumption,\u201d the report said. With its focus on the most severe and worsening countries, the UN agencies said the report did not \u201crepresent all countries/territories experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity\u201d. The agencies said 2024 marked the second consecutive year of declining funding for humanitarian assistance, while 12 appeals faced funding shortfalls of more than 75%, including for Ethiopia, Yemen, Syria and Myanmar. A Palestinian student who was stripped of her student visa after remarks she made about the Israel-Gaza war has won a human rights appeal against the UK Home Office\u2019s decision. The Home Office failed to demonstrate that the presence of Dana Abu Qamar, 20, was \u201cnot conducive to public good\u201d after the law student\u2019s visa was revoked in December 2023, according to a tribunal ruling. She came to the attention of authorities after statements made at a university demonstration on Gaza\u2019s historical resistance to Israel\u2019s \u201coppressive regime\u201d and a subsequent interview with Sky News. The dual Jordanian-Canadian citizen of Palestinian origin said: For 16 years Gaza has been under blockade, and for the first time they are actively resisting, they are not on the defence, and this is truly a once in a lifetime experience.\u201d She also said: And everyone is, we are both in fear, but also in fear of what, how Israel will retaliate and how we\u2019ve seen it retaliate overnight, and the missiles that it\u2019s launched and the attacks, but also we are full of pride. We are really, really full of joy of what happened.\u201d Abu Qamar, who led the Friends of Palestine society at the University of Manchester, said she was misinterpreted and that she was seeking to support Palestinian resistance to occupation and does not condone the use of violence against civilians, nor has she expressed support for Hamas. The tribunal said the Home Office decision was a \u201cdisproportionate interference with her protected right to free speech\u201d under the European convention on human rights. It found that her statements could not be taken as support for Hamas or the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October. Syrian state media said Israeli strikes hit the town of Qusayr near the Lebanese border on Thursday, the latest in a series of raids in the area, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cAn Israeli aggression targeted the Qusayr area in the southern Homs countryside,\u201d causing \u201cmaterial damage to the industrial city and some residential neighbourhoods,\u201d the state news agency, Sana, said. A senior Hamas official said on Thursday that the group rejects any proposal for a temporary halt to more than a year of fighting in Gaza and insists on a lasting ceasefire, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cThe idea of a temporary pause in the war, only to resume aggression later, is something we have already expressed our position on. Hamas supports a permanent end to the war, not a temporary one,\u201d Taher al-Nunu, a senior leader of the group, told AFP. Mediators seeking to broker a Gaza ceasefire are expected to propose a truce of \u201cless than a month\u201d to Hamas, a source with knowledge of the talks told AFP on Wednesday. Meetings between the Mossad head David Barnea, CIA director Bill Burns and Qatar\u2019s prime minister in Doha, which concluded on Monday, discussed proposing a \u201cshort-term\u201d truce of \u201cless than a month\u201d, the source told AFP on condition of anonymity because of the talks\u2019 sensitivity. The proposal involves exchanging Israeli hostages for Palestinians in Israeli prisons and increasing aid to Gaza, the source added. \u201cUS officials believe that if a short-term deal can be reached, it could lead to a more permanent agreement,\u201d the source told AFP. Nunu said the group had not received any proposal so far, adding if it gets such a plan, it would respond. However, he reiterated the demands the group has been insisting on for months: \u201ca permanent ceasefire, withdrawal (of Israeli forces) from Gaza, the return of displaced people, sufficient humanitarian aid to Gaza and a serious prisoner exchange deal\u201d. Israel\u2019s military said on Thursday it shot down a drone smuggling weapons from Egyptian territory to Israel on Wednesday, reports Reuters. Israeli officials have said during the war in Gaza that Palestinian armed group Hamas used tunnels running under the border into Egypt\u2019s Sinai region to smuggle arms. However, Egypt says it destroyed tunnel networks leading to Gaza years ago and created a buffer zone and border fortifications that prevent smuggling. Earlier in October, the Israeli military also said it foiled a weapon smuggling attempt from Egypt after downing a drone carrying guns and bullets, reports Reuters. Israel\u2019s military issued an evacuation order for residents in Lebanon\u2019s Baalbek city and surrounding areas on Thursday, for the second day in a row, reports Reuters. A Lebanese security source said one person was killed on Thursday by an Israeli strike on a road where a Hezbollah van carrying munitions was hit the previous day, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The drone strike hit the Araya-Kahhale road which links the capital Beirut to Lebanon\u2019s eastern Bekaa valley, the source told AFP, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. It targeted a Mercedes vehicle, killing the driver, the source said, without identifying the victim. The official National News Agency (NNA) said a \u201chostile drone\u201d targeted the car on the key road that passes through the town of Araya. On Wednesday, an Israeli strike hit a Hezbollah van carrying munitions on the same highway, according to the security source, who said the attack killed the driver. The same day, municipal authorities in Araya and Kahhale called on the Lebanese army to \u201cintervene immediately\u201d to stop the road being used to transport weapons or fighters, reports AFP. Also on Thursday, an Israeli drone strike hit a motorbike near the coastal town of Naqura, NNA said. Another motorbike was hit in the eastern Bekaa valley, it added. Reuters reports that the Israeli military said on Thursday it had shot down a drone smuggling weapons from Egyptian territory to Israel on Wednesday. No other information was provided. We will update the blog as more details come in. Israeli police said on Thursday they had arrested an Israeli couple on suspicion of spying for Iran, barely a week after two groups allegedly working for Tehran were detained, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cThe thwarting of Iran\u2019s efforts to recruit Israelis continues,\u201d said a statement from the police and Israel\u2019s internal security agency, Shin Bet. The two Israelis, a couple from the central city of Lod, had been involved in gathering intelligence on \u201cnational infrastructures, security sites and tracking a female academic,\u201d the statement alleged: Rafael and Lala Goliev \u2026 residents of Lod, were arrested after they carried out tasks on behalf of an Iranian cell that recruits Israelis from the Caucasus countries in Israel.\u201d According to AFP, Israeli police charged that the couple were recruited by Elshan (Elhan) Agayev, an Azerbaijani national acting on behalf of Iranian officials. It was unclear if Agayev is based in Israel. They alleged that the Golievs carried out surveillance of sensitive Israeli sites, including the headquarters of Israel\u2019s the Mossad spy agency, and collected intelligence on an academic working at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. As AFP reports, Thursday\u2019s announcement comes little more than a week after Israeli security services said they had uncovered two other suspected spy rings. The Israeli army\u2019s evacuation call for several areas of south Lebanon on Thursday, includes a Palestinian refugee camp, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). It warned it was poised to hit Hezbollah targets in those areas. \u201cHezbollah\u2019s terrorist activities force the IDF (army) to act forcefully against it in these areas, and we do not intend to harm you,\u201d the Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X. Among the areas listed was Rashidieh camp, which houses thousands of Palestinian refugees. Al-Haush, Borgholiyeh and Ansar are among the areas in southern Lebanon ordered to evacuate, reports Al Jazeera. It cites the Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee, as ordering residents of 10 towns and villages, mostly near Tyre and Nabatieh, to evacuate. He said the army would soon \u201cforcefully act\u201d against these areas. \u201cYou are prohibited from heading south. Any movement south could be dangerous to your life,\u201d he wrote in a post on X. The Israeli army has issued evacuation calls for several southern Lebanese villages, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). More details soon \u2026 A Lebanese family planning for a daughter\u2019s wedding were killed in an Israeli strike on their home, reports the Associated Press (AP). According to a report by the AP, the Gharibs\u2019 apartment in the al-Housh district of the Tyre neighbourhood was directly hit by an Israeli airstrike on 23 September. Reda Gharib, who lives in Senegal told the AP that his family in Tyre received a call from the Israeli military to evacuate or risk their lives. His aunts decided to leave for Beirut but his father, mother and three sisters remained. Gharib\u2019s father, Ahmed, a retired Lebanese army officer, his mother, Hanan, and his three sisters were all killed in the strike. \u201cThe whole apartment was gone. It is back to bare bones. As if there was nothing there,\u201d said Gharib, speaking to the AP from the Senegalese capital, Dakar, where he has been living since 2020. The Israeli military said it struck a Hezbollah site hiding rocket launchers and missiles. Gharib told the AP his family had no connection to Hezbollah. The direct hit gutted their apartment, while those above and below suffered only damage, suggesting a specific part of the building was targeted. Gharib said it was his family\u2019s home. The strike was one of more than 1,600 Israel said it carried out on 23 September, the first day of an intensified bombardment of Lebanon it has waged for the past month. More than 500 people were killed that day, a casualty figure not observed in Gaza on a single day until the second week, said Emily Tripp, director of London-based Airwars, a conflict monitoring group. Gharib told the AP that his sister Maya was engaged and planned to marry on 12 October but as tensions with Israel grew in September, Gharib\u2019s plans to come home for the wedding were uncertain. She told him she would put it off until he could get there. After the strike, her fiance, also an army officer, found her body and those of the rest of her family in a hospital morgue in Tyre. \u201cShe was not destined to have her wedding. We paraded her as a bride to paradise instead,\u201d Gharib said. US state department officials have identified nearly 500 potential incidents of civilian harm during Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza involving US-furnished weapons, but have not taken further action on any of them, according to three sources, including a US official familiar with the matter. The incidents \u2013 some of which may have violated international humanitarian law, according to the sources \u2013 have been recorded since 7 October 2023, when the Gaza war started. They are being collected by the state department\u2019s Civilian Harm Incident Response Guidance (CHIRG), a formal mechanism for tracking and assessing any reported misuse of US-origin weapons. State department officials gathered the incidents from public and non-public sources, including media reporting, civil society groups and foreign government contacts. The mechanism, which was established in August 2023 to be applied to all countries that receive US arms, has three stages: incident analysis, policy impact assessment and coordinated department action. None of the Gaza cases had yet reached the third stage of action, said a former US official familiar with the matter. Options, the former official said, could range from working with Israel\u2019s government to help mitigate harm, to suspending existing arms export licenses or withholding future approvals. The Washington Post first reported the nearly 500 incidents on Wednesday. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has warned Israel could carry out the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of Gaza if the international community does not make a determined stand to prevent it. Guterres made his appeal at a time of mounting civilian casualties from the Israeli bombardment of northern Gaza. A strike on Tuesday in Beit Lahiya district killed at least 93 people, in what the UN said was just one of at least seven \u201cmass casualty incidents\u201d across Gaza in the past week. At the same time, aid deliveries to Gaza are reported to have fallen to their lowest level since the start of the war, leading to growing allegations that Israel\u2019s true intention is to drive the remaining Palestinian population out of at least part of Gaza. The UN secretary general, speaking on the sidelines of the COP16 biodiversity conference in Colombia, suggested that the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of Gaza had been prevented until now by its people\u2019s refusal to succumb to the intense pressure to flee their homes and by Arab resolve not to accept mass population transfers. \u201cThe intention might be for the Palestinians to leave Gaza, for others to occupy it,\u201d Guterres told the Guardian. \u201cBut there has been \u2013 and I pay tribute to the courage and the resilience of the Palestinian people and to the determination of the Arab world \u2013 [an effort] to avoid the ethnic cleansing becoming a reality.\u201d \u201cWe will do everything possible to help them remain there and to avoid ethnic cleansing that might occur if there is not strong determination from the international community,\u201d he added. You can read the full report by Patrick Greenfield in Cali, Malak A Tantesh in Gaza and Julian Borger in Jerusalem here: Israeli strikes on the West Bank\u2019s Nur Shams refugee camp on Thursday killed two Palestinians including a child, Reuters reports, citing the Palestinian health ministry. One Palestinian was shot and killed by the Israeli army overnight in West Bank\u2019s refugee camp of Tulkarm, the health ministry added. The Israeli army said on Thursday it was conducting an operation targeting \u201cterrorist infrastructure\u201d in Nur Shams. Official Palestinian news agency Wafa said a large number of Israeli vehicles and heavy bulldozers stormed the city and headed towards the Nur Shams refugee camp. According to Reuters, the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) movement, al-Quds Brigades, said in a statement they detonated a highly explosive bomb in a military bulldozer to thwart the Israeli army\u2019s raid. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister has expressed hope that a ceasefire deal with Israel could be reached within days, after Hezbollah\u2019s new leader Naim Qassem said the militant group could agree to a possible truce under certain parameters. In his first public comments a day after being named to replace former longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, Qassem said however that Israel had yet to agree to any proposal that could be discussed, and that the Iran-backed group will keep fighting until it is offered terms it deems acceptable. \u201cIf the Israelis decide to stop the aggression, we say that we accept, but according to the conditions that we see as suitable,\u201d Qassem said, speaking from an undisclosed location in a pre-recorded televised address. \u201cWe will not beg for a ceasefire.\u201d It came as Israel\u2019s security cabinet met to discuss a possible truce, but also as Israel expanded their bombardment of the group\u2019s bastions, attacking the eastern Lebanese city of Baalbek, and said it had killed another senior Hezbollah commander. Lebanese caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati said he had previously not believed a deal would be possible until after Tuesday\u2019s US presidential election. But he said he became cautiously optimistic after speaking on Wednesday with the Biden administration\u2019s Middle East envoy Amos Hochstein, who was due to travel to Israel on Thursday. \u201cHochstein, during his call with me, suggested to me that we could reach an agreement before the end of the month and before November 5th,\u201d Mikati told Lebanon\u2019s Al Jadeed television. Israel\u2019s public broadcaster Kan published what it said was a draft agreement providing for an initial 60-day truce. The document, which the broadcaster said was a leaked proposal written by Washington, said Israel would withdraw its forces from Lebanon within the first week of the 60-day ceasefire. It largely aligned with details reported earlier by Reuters. Although negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah have made significant progress in the last 24 hours, the Biden administration has not reached a final agreement with either Israel or Lebanon, Axios reported citing two US officials with direct knowledge of the matter. The draft published by Kan was dated Saturday. When asked to comment, White House national security spokesperson Sean Savett said: There are many reports and drafts circulating. They do not reflect the current state of negotiations.\u201d In other developments: The Israeli army launched heavy airstrikes on the eastern city of Baalbek, famed for its Roman temples, and nearby villages. Tens of thousands of Lebanese, including many who sought shelter in Baalbek from other areas, fled after an Israeli evacuation warning. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said 19 people were killed in Israeli strikes on two towns in the Baalbek area on Wednesday. After the airstrikes, the Israeli military said it had targeted Hezbollah fuel reservoirs in the Bekaa valley region. In his first remarks as leader, Nassim Qassem said the series of blows dealt to the group in recent weeks had \u201churt\u201d Hezbollah, but asserted that the group had been able to reorganise its ranks swiftly after Nasrallah\u2019s death. \u201cHezbollah\u2019s capabilities are still available and compatible with a long war,\u201d he said. Qassem said he would stick to the war strategy laid out by his predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by Israel last month after full-scale fighting broke out. \u201cMy work programme is a continuation of the work programme of our leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah,\u201d Qassem said, pledging to press on with \u201cthe war plan that he [Nasrallah] developed with the leadership\u201d of the Iran-backed group. Donald Trump promised that he will bring \u201cpeace\u201d to the Middle East, with the US Republican nominee for president making the pronouncement in a letter just six days before the US election for the White House on 5 November. \u201cDuring my administration, we had peace in the Middle East, and we will have peace again very soon!\u201d he said in his letter to Lebanese Americans. At least 30 people were killed as Israel pummeled Gaza with new bombardments, Palestinian medics said. Eight of today\u2019s victims were killed in northern Gaza. The area Israel hit is near to where medics said at least 93 people had been killed or reported missing on Tuesday in an Israeli strike Washington called \u201chorrifying\u201d. The UN security council \u201cstrongly warned against any attempts to dismantle or diminish\u201d the operations and mandate of the UN Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, after Israel passed a law banning its operations. In a statement adopted by consensus, the 15-member body expressed grave concern over the legislation adopted by the Israeli parliament on Monday. The Israeli army said it had killed the deputy head of Hezbollah\u2019s elite Radwan force, Mustafa Ahmad Shahadi, in a strike in the Nabatieh area of south Lebanon. \u201cIn an intelligence-directed strike, the Israeli air force struck and eliminated Mustafa Ahmad Shahadi, deputy commander of Hezbollah\u2019s Radwan forces, in the area of Nabatieh,\u201d the army said in a statement. At least 43,163 Palestinians have been killed and 101,510 injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said. The ministry said on Wednesday that 102 Palestinians had been killed and 287 injured in the past 24 hours. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah group said it had launched drones at an Israeli base in the port city of Haifa. Hezbollah fighters \u201claunched an air attack at 7.45am (0545 GMT) \u2026 with a squadron of attack drones\u201d on a \u201cbase in southern Haifa\u201d, the group said in a statement."

            "content": "Senior US officials have held talks in Israel aimed at brokering a ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, on a day when more civilians in both countries were killed in the year-long war. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, who had expressed optimism of a speedy settlement \u201cin hours or days\u201d earlier on Thursday, said that Israel\u2019s \u201congoing escalation\u201d in his country \u201cdoes not inspire optimism\u201d. The country\u2019s health ministry said that Israeli attacks had killed 45 people in the previous 24 hours, amid bombing in the north-east Bekaa valley and infantry battles in the south. In one Bekaa village, eight people were killed from the same family. In northern Israel, seven people were killed by rocket fire from Lebanon, including four Thai agricultural workers, in the worst civilian losses in Israel on a single day since Israel began its ground incursions into Lebanon on 1 October. Israel issued its second evacuation order for the city of Baalbek and two surrounding villages in the Bekaa valley on Thursday afternoon, carrying out a series of airstrikes on the village of Durous a few hours later. The evacuation orders had prompted a mass exodus of residents from the city, which is home to a Unesco world heritage site. Despite the evacuation order and danger from Israeli bombing, some residents remained. In Bednayel, a village on the outskirts of Baalbek, rescuers pulled a corpse out of the rubble of a collapsed building levelled in an Israeli airstrike the night before. Eight people from the same family were killed in the strike. \u201cThe whole village shook. I came here and I pulled my brother out from the rubble. I pulled out pieces of him,\u201d said Fadi, a 30-year-old owner of a gaming cafe, whose house was destroyed and family killed in the airstrike. He dismissed talk of a pause in the fighting between Hezbollah and Israel, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t want a ceasefire, we want to pray at al-Aqsa mosque [in Jerusalem]. I want to take revenge, from the person who dropped the missile to the one who gave the order, [Benjamin] Netanyahu.\u201d The bombing and evacuation order also affected the operations of the nearby Dar Al Amal hospital, which sits on the edge of Israel\u2019s designated area of operations in Baalbek. Of the hospital\u2019s usual 700 staff, only 350 remain, the rest being displaced, according to the hospital director, Ali Allam. Three nurses have been killed in Israeli airstrikes over the last month while they were off duty. Two senior US envoys, Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk, met Netanyahu at his office on Thursday to talk about a ceasefire proposal for Lebanon. Later, Netanyahu\u2019s office said the prime minister had \u201cthanked our American friends for their efforts\u201d but \u201cmade it clear that the main point is not this or that agreement on paper but Israel\u2019s ability and determination to enforce the agreement and thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon, in a manner that will return our residents securely to their homes\u201d. According to the Israeli state broadcaster, Kan, the US-proposed deal is similar to the agreement which ended the last Israeli-Hezbollah war in 2006. Israel would withdraw its forces from Lebanon within the first week of the agreement. The Lebanese army would be deployed along the border, while Hezbollah would end its armed presence in the south. Israel would still have the right to target Hezbollah in self-defence and to take steps to ensure Hezbollah does not reconstitute in the south, while Israeli aircraft would continue to be able to carry out aerial reconnaissance over Lebanon. It is far from clear such conditions would be acceptable to either the Lebanese government or Hezbollah. Thursday\u2019s Hezbollah attack on Israel came in two main salvoes, the first in the morning when a rocket barrage fell on fields around the northern town of Metula close to the Lebanese border. The area has been evacuated but farmers are still allowed to cultivate their land during the day, mostly with migrant workers. Four of the five victims of the Metula barrage were Thai migrant workers and the fifth was an Israeli farmer. A few hours later, a second salvo of 25 rockets hit an olive grove near Haifa where people had gathered for the harvest. The Israeli health authorities said a 30-year-old man and 60-year-old woman were killed. In the West Bank, Palestinian authorities said three people had been killed in an Israeli raid. The Israeli army said it was targeting militants in the Nur Shams refugee camp in the West Bank city of Tulkarem, and had killed a Hamas militant who was involved in planning attacks. A senior Hamas official told Agence France-Presse that the group rejected any proposal for a temporary truce with Israel, an idea reportedly floated at talks in Doha over the weekend. The group is insisting on a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Also on Thursday, Philippe Lazzarini, who heads the UN Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa, accused Israel of severely damaging the organisation\u2019s headquarters in the West Bank\u2019s Nur Shams camp. The Israeli military, however, denied responsibility for the damage, saying: \u201cThe claim that the Unrwa offices in Nur Shams were destroyed by IDF soldiers is false. \u201cTerrorists planted explosives in the proximity of the Unrwa offices that were then detonated in an attempt to harm IDF soldiers. The explosives likely caused damage to the structure.\u201d On Monday, Israel passed a law banning Unrwa from operating in the country, which could impair its work in wartorn Gaza."

            "content": "Keir Starmer has called for unity in Britain and urged the nation to \u201cunequivocally stand with the Jewish community\u201d, as he reiterated calls for immediate ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon on the anniversary of the 7 October attacks. The prime minister described it as \u201cthe darkest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust\u201d, reflecting on the deaths of more than 1,000 people who were murdered by Hamas, including the young people massacred at a music festival, raped and brutally tortured in the aftermath. While he stood firm in his commitment to help \u201cbring the hostages home\u201d, he said \u201cwe must not look the other way as civilians bear the ongoing dire consequences of this conflict in the Middle East\u201d. He continued: \u201cWe will not falter in our pursuit of peace and on this day of pain and sorrow, we honour those we lost, and continue in our determination to return those still held hostage, help those who are suffering, and secure a better future for the Middle East.\u201d His comments come as the government earlier advised Israel to show \u201crestraint\u201d, while the prime minister had warned that \u201csparks\u201d from the Middle East conflict could \u201clight touchpapers in our communities at home\u201d. A series of rallies and demonstrations took place over the weekend, with more expected to take place around the country on Monday. In London, the Met police said 17 people had been arrested after Saturday\u2019s pro-Palestinian march in central London, as part of a \u201csignificant\u201d policing operation in response to planned protest and memorial events. On Sunday afternoon, thousands of people arrived at a memorial event being held in London\u2019s Hyde Park, organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Jewish Leadership Council and other groups. Supporters waved Israeli flags and placards with the faces of the hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza as they chanted \u201cbring them home\u201d. The mother of the sole British hostage still in Gaza a year after she was taken by Hamas said her daughter has been \u201cstripped of every human right\u201d and remains \u201cin hell\u201d, as she called for her safe return. Mandy Damari spoke about her daughter Emily publicly for the first time, through tears, and called for the release of the 101 hostages who remained in Gaza, saying each one was someone\u2019s child, grandchild, parent or grandparent. \u201cHow is it that she [Emily] is still imprisoned there after one year?\u201d Damari said. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t the whole world, especially Britain, fighting every moment to secure her release?\u201d Also at the event was Tracy-Ann Oberman, the actor and playwright, who said \u201cwe must not forget our humanity\u201d, adding it was \u201cheartening\u201d to see so many people in attendance. \u201cI\u2019m here today because it\u2019s about memorial and remembrance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about remembering the terrorist attack on 7 October. It\u2019s about remembering our dead and it\u2019s about remembering our hostages, some of whom are still alive and who we desperately want to bring home.\u201d The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said in a statement: \u201cI know, like me, Jewish and Muslim Londoners \u2013 and Londoners of every religion and of no organised faith \u2013 have been left distressed and utterly heartbroken by the cycle of terror, bloodshed and suffering that has engulfed the region. Many of us have seen images, or read news reports, of the horrors on 7 October and in Palestine that will haunt us for the rest of our lives.\u201d He repeated his call for a ceasefire and acknowledged the impact of the violence abroad has had on London\u2019s communities. \u201cWe cannot allow conflict overseas to divide us here at home,\u201d he said. In Waterloo a group of Jewish and Muslim women came together to mark the anniversary and to help \u201cstop the hate on [Britain\u2019s] streets\u201d. Dubbed a \u201csafe space\u201d by organisers, the group of six Jewish women and six Muslim women shared their feelings of \u201cexhaustion\u201d, \u201cpain\u201d and \u201csuffering\u201d, often through tears, but were also keen to express their \u201chope\u201d and \u201cgratitude\u201d that they felt had come from similar acts of unity. Organisers Julie Siddiqi, a Muslim, and Laura Marks, who is Jewish, are co-founders of the Nisa-Nashim Jewish and Muslim Women\u2019s Network. They told the PA news agency the meeting was a symbol of cross-faith unity against hatred and \u201cnot being made to feel we have to pick sides\u201d. Thousands also gathered in Manchester city centre for a pro-Israel march and rally, including Greater Manchester MPs Josh Simons and Christian Wakeford. The Met said it was likely that events and gatherings of various sizes would take place across London on Monday. Peter Kyle, a UK cabinet minister, speaking on the BBC One\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, said: \u201cWe do understand deeply what Israel has suffered in this year, but the only way forward is restraint, a ceasefire to create the space for a political solution, because this is getting more complicated. The war is deepening and it is not moving towards the peace that we need, so we are urging the steps that will take us towards that peaceful settlement\u201d. The prime minister, in an article for the Sunday Times, called out the \u201cvile hatred\u201d that had been directed towards Jews and Muslims since the 7 October attacks. He urged all parties involved in the conflict to \u201cact with restraint and return to political, not military solutions\u201d, having previously expressed his concern that the \u201cregion is on the brink\u201d after Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel. Writing in the newspaper, he said: \u201cThe flames from this deadly conflict now threaten to consume the region. And the sparks light touchpapers in our own communities here at home.\u201d He added: \u201cThere are always some who would use conflict abroad to stoke conflict here. Since October 7, we have watched vile hatred against Jews and Muslims rise in our communities.\u201d The Foreign Office said more than 250 people had been able to leave Lebanon so far on the three chartered flights that had already left Beirut. There are no further scheduled charter flights, but the situation would be kept under review. The shadow foreign secretary, Andrew Mitchell, told Sky News\u2019s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips programme: \u201cThe Iranians, of course, have already responded and on both occasions when they attacked \u2013 directly from Iran \u2013 Israel, British military forces were engaged in trying to help. \u201cIsrael is a very strong ally. Of course we want to see de-escalation, we want to see negotiation and we want to see people\u2019s eyes lifted towards the possibility of a political solution.\u201d Zarah Sultana, an MP who was suspended from the Labour party for rebelling over the two-child benefit cap and is now sitting as an independent, told the BBC \u201cthere is no scenario\u201d where the UK\u2019s involvement in an attack on Iran could be justified. She added: \u201cIf we look at the past two decades of British foreign policy in the Middle East there are catalogues of failures and clearly lessons haven\u2019t been learned. When we look at what the British public think, 56% of them back a ban on arms sales to Israel, only 17% oppose that, 67% believe Israel has committed war crimes and 84% want Netanyahu arrested if he enters the UK. Clearly there\u2019s a detachment from the British public opinion and what the government are saying.\u201d The former Conservative foreign secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, said what was needed from Israelis and Palestinians was \u201cleadership that is prepared not to forget the past, but to move on to a political dialogue\u201d."

            "date": "2024-10-18T04:10:08Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden has urged Israel\u2019s prime minister to \u201cmove on\u201d and make progress towards a ceasefire in Gaza after the killing of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader and mastermind of the 7 October attack, as world leaders renewed a push for an end to the conflict. Hours after the killing on Thursday in Rafah, Gaza\u2019s southernmost town, the US president congratulated Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Sinwar \u201chas a lot of blood on his hands \u2013 American blood, Israeli blood, and others\u201d. Speaking as he arrived in Germany to meet European leaders, Biden said he felt \u201cmore hopeful\u201d about the prospects of a ceasefire and would send the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to Israel in the next four or five days. Biden joined figures including his vice-president, Kamala Harris, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in urging progress towards a ceasefire. Blinken held separate phone calls on Thursday with the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, and the Qatari prime minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, on ending the conflict in the Middle East, the US state department said. The push came as Iran\u2019s mission to the UN said the killing would strengthen the \u201cspirit of resistance\u201d and inspire future generations, while Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed group in Lebanon, announced \u201cthe transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with Israel\u201d. At time of writing, Hamas was yet to comment on the death of its leader. In a TV address, Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, described Sinwar\u2019s death as the \u201cbeginning of the end\u201d but added that Israel must \u201cstand firm on our ground\u201d and \u201ccontinue to fight\u201d. \u201cWe have demonstrated today that all those who try to harm us, this is what happens to them,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cAnd how the forces of good can always beat the forces of evil and darkness. The war is still ongoing, and it\u2019s costly.\u201d It was yet to become clear what impact Sinwar\u2019s killing would have on Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza. Most analysts said Israel remained intent on military occupation of the Palestinian territory for the foreseeable future. Ahead of his visit to Germany, Biden said: \u201cThere is now the opportunity for a \u2018day after\u2019 in Gaza without Hamas in power, and for a political settlement that provides a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike. Yahya Sinwar was an insurmountable obstacle to achieving all of those goals. That obstacle no longer exists. But much work remains before us.\u201d Earlier, Blinken called Sinwar a \u201cvicious and unrepentant terrorist\u201d and said he had repeatedly torpedoed agreements that would have ended the conflict. \u201cOn multiple occasions over the past months, Sinwar rebuffed efforts by the United States and its partners to bring this war to a close through an agreement that would return the hostages to their families and alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people,\u201d Blinken said. As news of Sinwar\u2019s death, and gruesome images of his body, spread in Gaza, many were left wondering what the future holds. \u201cThe assassination of Yahya Sinwar is a tragedy for the people of Gaza, we did not expect it,\u201d said Amal al-Hanawi, 28, from Nuseirat in the centre of the Gaza Strip where she took refuge after fleeing fighting in the north. \u201cI have the impression that Hamas is over, that there is no longer a powerful resistance, it has fallen apart,\u201d she told AFP, saying that this is \u201cexactly what Netanyahu wants\u201d. \u201cWe are exhausted, the war has gone too far, it has taken everything from us,\u201d said Shadi Nofal Abou Maher, 23, saying he hoped \u201cthe world will intervene\u201d to end the war. In Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip, a displaced Palestinian named Thabet Amour told Reuters the Palestinian fight would continue. \u201cThis is resistance that does not disappear when men disappear,\u201d he said. \u201cThe assassination of Sinwar will not lead to the end of the resistance or to a compromise or surrender and raising the white flag.\u201d In the streets as well as on social networks, some welcomed the \u201cresistance\u201d led by Sinwar, praising him for fighting until the end. \u201cHe will be remembered as a leader who died on the battlefield,\u201d said 36-year-old Ahmed Omar. Families of Israeli hostages said that while the killing of Sinwar was a significant achievement, it would not be complete while hostages remained in Gaza. Avi Marciano, the father of Noa Marciano, who was killed in captivity by Hamas, told Israeli broadcaster KAN that \u201cthe monster, the one who took her from me, who had the blood of all our daughters on his hands, finally met the gates of hell\u201d. \u201cA little justice, but no comfort,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be comfort only when Naama, Liri, Agam, Daniela and Karina, our girls\u2019 friends, return home.\u201d Some Israelis hailed the news of Sinwar\u2019s death as a sign of better things to come. \u201cI am celebrating the death of Sinwar, who has brought us nothing but harm, who has taken people hostage,\u201d said one Israeli woman, Hemda, who only gave her first name. Attending a Tel Aviv rally demanding the hostages\u2019 release, 60-year-old Sisil, who also gave only her first name, said his killing presented a \u201conce in a lifetime opportunity\u201d for \u201ca hostage deal to end the war\u201d. The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023 that killed 1,200 people and in which 250 people were taken hostage. Israel\u2019s retaliation has killed at least 42,438 people, mostly civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, which the UN considers reliable.

            "date": "2024-10-29T09:00:05Z",
            "content": "With the spooky season nearing its climax, Americans are as scared as ever \u2013 and they are generally afraid of more things, too, according to a new survey. Those findings are contained in the latest edition of the Survey of American Fears that California\u2019s Chapman University has been publishing annually around Halloween. Corrupt government officials, the US becoming involved in a third world war, and terrorism (cyber or otherwise) are all among the top 10 fears flagged by the study released in the waning stages of the 5 November presidential election \u2013 and as Russia and Israel continue warring with Ukraine and Hamas, respectively. More than half of the US is afraid of those particular global-level concerns \u2013 as they are more personal hardships such as seeing loved ones die or become ill and having enough money for the future, which are also in the study\u2019s top 10. But many of the 85 fears that the survey\u2019s 1,008 respondents were asked about \u2013 including spiders, ghosts and public speaking \u2013 had high percentage shares. For instance, nearly half of Americans \u2013 about 48% \u2013 fear the climate crisis that is primarily being driven by the burning of fossil fuels and has supercharged destructive hurricanes like Helene and Milton, which recently devastated swaths of the south-east US. It wasn\u2019t always that way, according to the study\u2019s authors. Only Americans\u2019 top fear \u2013 a corrupt government \u2013 was shared by more than 50% of the public in the US when the survey debuted in 2019, said a statement from Ed Day, an associate professor of sociology at Chapman who contributed to the research. Now all of the survey\u2019s top 10 fears are shared by more than half of respondents. \u201cThis tells me Americans are becoming more afraid in general, about everything,\u201d said a separate statement from Chapman sociology professor and department chairperson Christopher Bader. Bader said the way people get their information about the world around them is almost certainly playing a role in making them more fearful, whether of the government, nuclear or biological warfare, or deadly illnesses coming for them or those they love. \u201cSocial media and websites target people by showing them things that they are afraid of,\u201d his statement said. \u201cThrough algorithms, people are being fed their fears, and we believe that\u2019s increasing people\u2019s overall level of fear.\u201d The survey contains bad news for people afraid of flying, needles or blood. Fewer than 15% of the public shares those same phobias, according to the Chapman researchers\u2019 findings, which were released a little more than a week in advance of Halloween\u2019s arrival on Thursday. Meanwhile, despite warnings of a spike in Islamophobia amid Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, only 8.7% of the Chapman survey\u2019s respondents reported being fearful of Muslims \u2013 making that the lowest of the 85 concerns asked about. Hardly any of the survey\u2019s respondents reported being afraid of immigrants (12.2%) or of American whites no longer being the US\u2019s racial majority (16.2%) despite the racist rhetoric surrounding both topics that has seeped its way into mainstream rightwing politics. Chapman said the market research company SSRS conducted its nationally representative survey, which utilized a probability-based method. The survey\u2019s margin of error is +/-4%, said Chapman officials, who added that they conduct the research to understand what makes Americans of all creeds afraid \u2013 and the consequences that stem from that. The survey\u2019s researchers also made it a point to say that people\u2019s fears often do not align with reality. For instance, large numbers of Americans report a fear of being murdered or raped by strangers \u2013 33.3% and 29.5%, respectively. But, according to the Pew Research Center, violence in the US has been declining in recent years. Such misperceptions can translate into real-world effects, such as by convincing officials to prioritize neutralizing serial killers rather than domestic abusers, who are much more common. \u201cWe are so focused on stranger danger that it leads us to spend resources in the wrong way,\u201d Bader said in a statement. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2024 to restore missing words that did not make clear it is \u201ca fear of\u201d being murdered or raped by strangers that large numbers of Americans report."

            "date": "2024-10-29T19:38:24Z",
            "content": "The suspect accused of murdering three girls in Southport is facing new charges of possessing terrorist material and producing the highly toxic poison ricin, police have announced. Axel Rudakubana, 18, will appear at Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday charged with producing the biological toxin and having a document titled \u201cMilitary studies in the Jihad against the Tyrants \u2013 the al-Qaida training manual\u201d. Serena Kennedy, the chief constable of Merseyside police, said the murder of the three girls \u2013 Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven \u2013 was not being treated as a terrorist incident. She said no evidence pointing to a terrorist motive had been discovered. Rudakubana was arrested on 29 July shortly after a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport in the first week of the school summer holiday. As well as the three murder charges, he is also charged with 10 attempted murders for alleged attacks on a further eight children and two adults. He is also charged with possessing a bladed article. At a press conference at Merseyside police headquarters on Tuesday, Kennedy said the new charges followed a \u201clengthy and complex\u201d three-month investigation, and she made a plea for people not to speculate about the alleged offences. Ricin was discovered at Rudakubana\u2019s home in the village of Banks, about 5 miles from Southport, in early August, days after the attack. Kennedy said there was no evidence that ricin was present at Hart Space, the scene of the knife attack, and that counter-terrorism police had \u201cnot declared the events of 29 July as a terrorist incident\u201d. She said: \u201cAt this time, counter-terrorism policing has not declared the attack on Monday 29 July a terrorist incident. I recognise that the new charges may lead to speculation. \u201cThe matter for which Axel Rudakubana has been charged with under the Terrorism Act does not require motive to be established. For a matter to be declared a terrorist incident, motivation would need to be established.\u201d She added that counter-terrorism officers were continuing to assess the evidence and that the full case against Rudakubana, who was born in Cardiff, would be disclosed at the criminal trial, planned for January. \u201cI would strongly advise everyone to avoid speculation about the motivation in this case,\u201d Kenendy said. \u201cThe criminal proceedings against Axel Rudakubana are live and he has a right to a fair trial. It is extremely important that there is no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online that could prejudice these procedures.\u201d She added: \u201cMy plea is to be patient. Don\u2019t engage in rumour speculation. Don\u2019t believe everything you read on social media. We must not lose sight of the families of Elsie, Bebe and Alice, who are still grieving, and the families of the others who were present at Hart Street on 29 July. We must do everything to ensure the justice process is not prejudiced.\u201d The Guardian understands 2,000 riot officers are on standby on Tuesday, fearing the disclosure of the new charges could trigger potential unrest. Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch, who are days away from learning which of them will become the new Conservative party leader, immediately issued statements raising concerns about the approach of the police and Labour government. Jenrick said the attack was of \u201cimmense public concern\u201d and that people \u201chad a right to know the truth straight away\u201d but that he was \u201cseriously concerned that facts may have been withheld\u201d. He added: \u201cAny suggestion of a cover-up will permanently damage public trust in whether we\u2019re being told the truth about crime in our country. Keir Starmer must urgently explain to the country what he knew about the Southport attack and when he learned it. \u201cAcross the board the hard reality of mass migration is being covered up. We need the truth \u2013 and we need to change.\u201d Nazir Afzal, the former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England, condemned Jenrick for his comments. He told the Guardian: \u201cThe kind of comment Mr Jenrick has made when proceedings are active, any statements that could prejudice proceedings are unacceptable and may be unlawful. \u201cThere is no excuse for the kind of comments that are being made while proceedings are active.\u201d Neil Basu, the former head of the UK\u2019s counter-terrorism policing, also condemned Jenrick, saying such comments might jeopardise justice. \u201cThis is irresponsible, and repeating the mistakes of others, failing to calm a very volatile situation which we faced this summer. \u201cI think he is stupid, he\u2019s trying to win an election, and he is trying to whip up support among his base. He has made a stupid mistake.\u201d Badenoch said it was \u201cquite clear that there are serious questions to be asked of the police, the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] and also of Keir Starmer\u2019s response to the whole situation\u201d. She added: \u201cParliament is the right place for this to happen. While we must abide by the rules of contempt of court and not prejudice this case it is important that there is appropriate scrutiny.\u201d Downing Street denied the government had been involved in decision-making about the timing of an announcement about charges against Rudakubana. Asked if there was any government involvement in decisions on the timing, a No 10 spokesperson said: \u201cNo, charging decisions and when those are made are for the CPS.\u201d The spokesperson also said it was \u201cnot correct\u201d to say the government had been involved in withholding facts from the public. They added: \u201cCharging decisions are independently made by the CPS and I would point you to the CPS statement and statements from the police.\u201d The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, warned against speculation. \u201cThese additional charges will undoubtedly be distressing for people in Southport,\u201d she said. \u201cThe most important thing is to get justice for Bebe, Alice and Elsie and their heartbroken families, and all those affected by the attack, and nobody should put that at risk.\u201d Dominic Grieve, the former Conservative attorney general, said potentially prejudicial comments risked securing justice for the victims and their families. He told the Guardian: \u201cNo one should comment on a subjudice case in a manner that prejudices the outcome. \u201cIf a fair trial process is affected by comment in breach of the Contempt of Court Act the rights of the victims are potentially as undermined as the rights of defendants.\u201d One former Conservative minister said: \u201cI wish they had avoided the temptation to comment ... In this case, the police have explicitly warned against jumping to conclusions on the basis of the new charges. And surely the overriding objective should be to avoid any risk that trial collapses due to prejudicial public commentary.\u201d The killings led to the spread of disinformation about the suspect, and to a series of riots across England that resulted in more than 1,000 people being charged. Since the initial arrest and charging of Rudakubana, the investigation has continued, involving officers from Merseyside police assisted by counter-terrorism detectives. Dr Renu Bindra, of the UK Health Security Agency, said its experts had found no evidence that any of those present at Hart Space, first responders, or members of the public were exposed to ricin. She said its experts assessed the risk to the wider public as \u201clow\u201d. After Wednesday\u2019s magistrates court hearing, Rudakubana is next due in court on 13 November at Liverpool crown court."

            "date": "2024-10-25T15:40:45Z",
            "content": "The far-right leader Tommy Robinson has been charged under the Terrorism Act and is being held in custody before a planned march of his supporters amid fears of a repeat of violence that erupted when he was imprisoned in 2018. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, handed himself in to Folkestone police station on Friday afternoon where he was charged with failing to provide the pin to his mobile phone under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act. He was bailed to appear in court next month, Kent police said. He was then remanded in custody under a high court direction, the force said. In July Robinson allegedly refused to give police access to his mobile phone when he was stopped under the Terrorism Act at the Channel tunnel. He had been bailed subject to returning to Folkestone police station. He is also due to appear at Woolwich crown court on Monday on separate charges of contempt of court for repeating libellous allegations against a Syrian refugee. Robinson\u2019s supporters, who now control his X account, told his 1 million followers on the platform that he was being held on remand until Monday\u2019s court appearance. The Metropolitan police have said they expect a \u201cbusy day\u201d on Saturday as Robinson\u2019s supporters plan to march from Victoria to Whitehall under the banner \u201cUniting the Kingdom\u201d, while a Stand Up to Racism counter protest is also planned. The United Families and Friends Campaign is holding its annual procession from Trafalgar Square to remember relatives who have died in police custody, an event that will include protest over the acquittal this week of the firearms officer who shot dead Chris Kaba. The anti-fascist campaign Hope Not Hate predicted the planned far-right demonstration on Saturday would morph into a protest demanding Robinson\u2019s freedom. It also fears a repeat of June 2018 when five police officers were injured during clashes with Robinson\u2019s supporters. Speaking at a briefing before Robinson\u2019s charge had been confirmed, Joe Mulhall, Hope Not Hate\u2019s director of research, said: \u201cIf we look at what happened in 2018 when he was previously imprisoned it actually galvanised the Free Tommy movement, which saw the largest demonstrations we\u2019d seen in a very long time outside parliament. And they were very, very angry and confrontational. There were scenes of people throwing bottles at Downing Street and the like. I think Lennon is anticipating that will happen again. His whole thing is that he\u2019s a martyr going down for free speech.\u201d Before arriving at Folkestone police station in a black Nissan Elgrand, Robinson was asked on X by a journalist about the claim that he expected to be regarded as a free speech martyr. Robinson responded by posting a screengrab of the questions and calling the journalist a \u201cfake news wanker\u201d and adding: \u201cWrite whatever you want no 1 gives a fuck any more. We are the media.\u201d Hope Not Hate said it expected the demonstration to be larger than a gathering of Robinson\u2019s supporters in July when about 30,000 people protested against immigration. Nick Lowles, the group\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a lot angrier, regardless of whether Lennon is there or not. This one is very much aimed at the prime minister, the police, and this sense of injustice around the riots. My understanding is the police are quite concerned about the public order element. \u201cThe chatter in the football hooligan WhatsApp groups is that they are coming in quite big numbers. And given that many of the people who will be there have a kind of liking for violence or disorder, I can understand why the police are worried.\u201d The Met said there would be \u201csignificant policing presence\u201d in central London on Saturday to ensure the two rival demonstrations are kept apart. It has also imposed conditions under the Public Order Act about timings and locations of the rival demonstrations \u201cto prevent serious disruption or disorder\u201d. The deputy assistant commissioner Rachel Williams, who is leading the operation, said: \u201cWe are well prepared for what is set to be a busy day in the centre of London. \u201cOur role is to ensure that those attending the various events can do so safely and that they can exercise their right to lawful protest. We will have significant resources in place to respond to any incidents, to deal decisively with any offences, and to keep disruption to other members of the public and businesses to a minimum. \u201cWe know that when groups with opposing views come together it can lead to conflict and disorder and a key part of our role is ensuring that does not happen.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 26 October 2024. An earlier version said the United Families and Friends Campaign was \u201cplanning a protest\u201d against the acquittal of the officer who shot Chris Kaba; it has been clarified that the event is the group\u2019s annual remembrance procession, although incorporating protest over Kaba\u2019s killing."

            "content": "This blog will be closing shortly. Thank you for reading it and for the comments below the line today. You can keep up to date with the Guardian\u2019s UK politics reporting here. Here is a summary of the latest developments: Keir Starmer does not think all owners of stocks and shares fall outside his definition of \u201cworking people\u201d, Downing Street has signalled, amid confusion over who will be protected from tax rises in next week\u2019s budget. The prime minister had suggested asset owners would not fall within his conception of what a working person is. The government has been asked repeatedly to define this term, in a bid to establish which taxes may rise in the budget. On Friday morning, a Treasury minister said it was \u201cimportant to focus on\u201d where people are getting their money from in relation to the debate over the \u201cworking people\u201d definition. James Murray told Sky News that \u201ca working person is someone who goes out to work and who gets their income from work\u201d. Starmer has said he understands the \u201cstrength of feeling\u201d in the Commonwealth about reparatory justice but that countries should work together to ensure their future is \u201cnot in the shadow of the past, but is illuminated by it\u201d. Speaking in an executive session of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) hosted in Samoa, the prime minister conceded that the Commonwealth had to \u201cacknowledge our shared history \u2013 especially when it\u2019s hard\u201d. Downing Street has firmly ruled out paying reparations to its former colonies and said it\u2019s not on the agenda for the summit, but Caribbean countries have been pushing for them to be mentioned in the communique. On the subject of slavery reparations, Downing Street has said that its position on reparations also covers non-financial reparations. The prime minister\u2019s deputy spokesperson said: \u201cOur position on reparations is clear, and that goes for other forms of non-financial reparatory justice too. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s focus is on addressing the challenges that we face. Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick has said the UK should \u201cunequivocally reject\u201d claims of reparations. He said in a speech at the Henry Jackson Society: \u201cWe must unequivocally reject these claims, they are based on false and misleading narratives about our past, after all it was Britain that worked harder than nearly any other country to eradicate the slave trade.\u201d Jenrick has said the contest is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d over after a survey by ConservativeHome suggested he was trailing Kemi Badenoch by 31% to 55%. Asked whether the contest was all over, Jenrick said: \u201cAbsolutely not \u2013 this is neck and neck, that\u2019s a survey not a poll.\u201d Downing Street will announce five new freeports in next week\u2019s budget as part of its effort to drive economic growth. Ministers will set out plans to establish five new low-tax zones, plus an investment zone in the East Midlands, where businesses will benefit from tax breaks such as lower tariffs and customs. Starmer said the freeports being announced next week would \u201chave this government\u2019s stamp on them\u201d despite being a policy inherited from the Tories. Rachel Reeves must \u201cget the balance right\u201d when announcing changes to Britain\u2019s debt rules in next week\u2019s budget given the potential knock-on effects to borrowing and mortgage rates, the boss of NatWest has warned. The bank\u2019s chief executive, Paul Thwaite, said markets would be sensitive to the chancellor\u2019s reasons for releasing up to \u00a350bn of borrowing headroom after she confirmed in Washington on Thursday that she planned to rewrite her fiscal rules. The value of the UK\u2019s private healthcare market rose to a record \u00a312.4bn last year as long NHS waiting lists fuelled demand from individuals and the health service paid for nearly \u00a33.5bn of procedures to help ease the care backlog. As private medical insurance boomed, total revenues generated in the independent healthcare sector hit an all-time high in real terms pegged to 2003 prices, research revealed. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, has been charged with failing to provide the pin to his mobile phone under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, Kent police said. The charge is in relation to an incident in Folkestone on Sunday 28 July after officers stopped Robinson under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Supporters of Robinson are due to hold a demonstration on Saturday, which is expected to be met with a counter-protest from Stand Up to Racism campaigners. Downing Street is blocking moves to include a ban on smoking outdoors in the upcoming Tobacco and Vapes bill amid fierce opposition by the hospitality trade. No 10 officials privately believe that banning people from lighting up in pub gardens is \u201can unserious\u201d policy and is not backed by good evidence showing that it harms non-smokers. The SNP will need to make \u201cuncomfortable commitments\u201d to gain the support of the Scottish Greens for the budget, Lorna Slater has said. The Greens\u2019 co-leader said her party will require the Scottish government to make promises similar to those made in the Bute House agreement (BHA). AstraZeneca has said it may cut jobs at its UK operation if the government enforces a global push to make companies share profits derived from nature\u2019s genetic codes, multiple sources have told the Guardian. The alleged comments from the company came amid a concerted lobbying push by the pharmaceutical industry against the profit-sharing measures. Two Scottish pensioners have been given permission to proceed with their legal challenge against the UK and Scottish and governments\u2019 decision to cut the winter fuel payment. The case\u2019s argument rests on the accusation that both governments failed to adequately consult those of pension age on the change and did not release an equality impact assessment on the changes. Michelle O\u2019Neill has insisted the powersharing structures in Northern Ireland remain stable after several controversies that have hit Sinn F\u00e9in. In an effort to draw a line under a difficult month for her party, the first minister said she has spent four weeks answering questions on the various furores but was now keen to focus on the future for the devolved executive she jointly leads with DUP deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly. The EU executive has said it has failed to reach agreement with the UK government in a dispute over fishing rights and has triggered an arbitration process under the post-Brexit deal. The European Commission announced on Friday that it was requesting an arbitration tribunal over the UK\u2019s decision to ban industrial fishing of sandeel in the North Sea. More than 29,000 migrants have arrived in the UK so far this year after crossing the Channel, including 500 in a single day, Home Office figures show. On Thursday, 509 people made the journey in 11 boats, taking the provisional total for 2024 to date to 29,154. A former UK defence chief has warned \u201cdire consequences\u201d would follow if European leaders fail to hold their nerve and continue to support Ukraine. Jock Stirrup, who served as head of the armed forces between 2006 and 2010, acknowledged there are \u201csigns of growing war weariness\u201d and a desire to end the conflict whatever it takes. Speaking during a House of Lords debate, Lord Stirrup said it has been a \u201cdifficult\u201d year for Ukraine as weapons and personnel shortages are \u201champering\u201d its efforts to deal with the \u201cgrinding war of attrition\u201d pursued by Russia. When opening the debate, defence minister Vernon Coaker, reiterated the UK government\u2019s support for Ukraine as he said Russia\u2019s war represented a \u201csustained attack\u201d on the United Nations charter and the rules and norms that underpin security and prosperity. Businesses that import critical minerals to the UK will be given access to state-backed loans in a move to counter China\u2019s dominance in the market. The chancellor is expected to announce extra government support to encourage the import of critical minerals such as lithium, graphite and cobalt in her budget next week. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, has been charged with failing to provide the pin to his mobile phone under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, Kent police said. The charge is in relation to an incident in Folkestone on Sunday 28 July after officers stopped Robinson under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The PA news agency reports that Robinson has been bailed to appear at Westminster magistrates court on 13 November 2024. Supporters of Robinson are due to hold a demonstration on Saturday, which is expected to be met with a counter-protest from Stand Up to Racism campaigners. The Metropolitan police and British Transport Police are due to be supported by officers from other forces across the country as the Met said there will be a \u201csignificant police presence\u201d to ensure the two groups are kept apart. Robinson arrived at Folkestone police station shortly after 3pm on Friday. \u2022 This post was amended on 25 October 2024 as it initially said the counter-protest would be from Stop the War campaigners. Two Scottish pensioners have been given permission to proceed with their legal challenge against the UK and Scottish and governments\u2019 decision to cut the winter fuel payment, reports the PA news agency. The decision by the court of session means the challenge, brought by Peter and Florence Fanning, of Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, will now proceed to a procedural hearing in December ahead of a full \u201csubstantive\u201d hearing in January. The proceedings were raised with the help of the Govan Law Centre against the Scottish government and the UK work and pensions secretary after the move to end universal entitlement to the payment. The decision, which was announced by chancellor, Rachel Reeves, following Labour\u2019s election win, led to the Scottish government \u2013 which was due to take control over a similar payment through the devolved Social Security Scotland but has since announced a delay \u2013 to follow suit. According to the PA news agency, the case asks the court to rule whether the decision was unlawful, which would then allow the petitioners to ask the court to, in effect, set aside the policy and restore the winter fuel payment to all. Govan Law Centre said the permission to proceed, which was granted by Lady Hood in Edinburgh on Thursday, means the case has been assessed as having \u201ca real prospect of success\u201d in terms the applicable legislation. A spokesperson for Govan Law Centre said: Our clients are delighted that the court has granted permission for their judicial review challenge to proceed to a full hearing in early January. We await a decision on civil legal aid from the Scottish Legal Aid Board early next week in relation to the proceedings. If civil legal aid is granted we will then submit an urgent application for sanction for the employment of both junior and senior counsel and will announce our final legal team in early course.\u201d The case\u2019s argument rests on the accusation that both governments failed to adequately consult those of pension age on the change and did not release an equality impact assessment on the changes. The PA news agency reports that a freedom of information request revealed an abridged version of such an assessment had been carried out by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), with the UK government arguing a full study was not required. The Fannings\u2019 legal action was launched in September with the support of former first minster and Alba party leader Alex Salmond, who died on 12 October. The UK and Scottish governments were asked for comment by the PA news agency. The SNP will need to make \u201cuncomfortable commitments\u201d to gain the support of the Scottish Greens for the budget, Lorna Slater has said. According to the PA news agency, the Greens\u2019 co-leader said her party will require the Scottish government to make promises similar to those made in the Bute House agreement (BHA). The BHA was struck between the two parties after the 2021 Holyrood election by then first minister Nicola Sturgeon, Slater and her fellow Green co-leader Patrick Harvie. The deal saw Slater and Harvie join the government as ministers as agreement was reached across a raft of progressive policies. Those included commitments on rent controls and reforming the Gender Recognition Act to make it easier for trans people to change their legally recognised sex. Speaking to the PA news agency on Friday ahead of the Scottish Greens\u2019 conference in Greenock at the weekend, Slater said her party is willing to work with the government on its budget. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to go into negotiations on the budget with an open mind,\u201d she said, adding: But we need to be clear about what we need to see in that budget, and it\u2019s going to be the same kind of commitments that we saw under the Bute House agreement.\u201d Slater said she wants to see a \u201cclear focus\u201d on the climate emergency and poverty. \u201cThat means the SNP need to commit to doing some things which may be uncomfortable for them,\u201d she said. \u201cThings like putting in place some taxes to support local authorities, things like the cruise ship levy.\u201d The BHA ended earlier this year and then first minister Humza Yousaf sacked Slater and Harvie from his government in a move which ultimately led to his own resignation. The SNP failed to return a majority of MSPs in 2021 and relied on the Greens to form a majority. Since the BHA collapsed, the SNP has governed as a minority and it means each vote requires support from one of the opposition parties. Also speaking on Friday, Harvie said the government must use \u201cevery lever possible\u201d to protect public services in the upcoming budget, \u201cincluding improvements to the tax system\u201d. The Greens have proposed a number of taxes targeting the wealthy, including on private jets and mansions. Income tax is already higher in Scotland than elsewhere in the UK, with changes made by the Scottish government meaning anyone who earns over \u00a328,000 will begin to pay more tax than those south of the border. Harvie told the PA news agency: We\u2019ve made good progress on having a fairer tax system in terms of income so that the wealthiest, the highest earners, are paying their fair share, and people on low and middle incomes are protected. But we need to broaden that approach and make sure that we\u2019re doing everything possible to protect public services.\u201d Finance secretary Shona Robison will unveil her budget on 4 December. She has warned finances are tight, having already announced up to \u00a3500m worth of cuts to public services in the summer. Chancellor Rachel Reeves will deliver the UK budget on 30 October. The Scottish government has been approached for comment by the PA news agency. While the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, grapples with the parlous \u00a340bn funding gap in Britain\u2019s finances, another \u00a325bn of annual revenue is revving up to disappear into the sunset. As the Treasury knows all too well, turning cars electric will spell the end of that great money-spinner fuel duty. But no one appears ready to grab the wheel and tax motoring in a different way. Road pricing was the future, once, and Tony Blair, its last champion in Downing Street, is back via his TBI thinktank to push it again. Proponents of road pricing \u2013 or metering, charging, pay-per-mile \u2013 have traditionally been driven by two impulses: managing road congestion, and raising revenue fairly from motoring. The former most concerned the last Labour government; the latter has become a clear and present danger for the Treasury. That \u00a325bn from fuel duty, levied on petrol and diesel at the pumps, more or less covers the entire cost of Britain\u2019s road and railway system. Electric cars, which pay zero fuel duty, make up almost a fifth of new registrations. The TBI is the latest group to weigh in ahead of Reeves\u2019 30 October budget, urging her to introduce a road charge of 1p per mile for cars and vans, and 2.5p to 4p for lorries and HGVs \u2013 \u201ca crucial step in reforming motoring taxation for the electric-vehicle era [and] preventing a growth-stifling rise in congestion\u201d. It follows the Campaign for Better Transport, which suggests pay-per-mile charges initially for electric vehicles only. A host of other groups, including the RAC, have also declared the need for similar reform. The head of the National Infrastructure Commission, Sir John Armitt, said road pricing was \u201cinevitable\u201d. But is it? Motorists have got used to being treated with kid gloves come budget time. Since 2010, Conservative chancellors have made great play of freezing fuel duty instead of supposedly scheduled rises \u2013 with Rishi Sunak\u2019s temporary 5p cut in 2022 leaving it at 52.9p \u2013 to much acclaim from the rightwing press, for whom fuel duty and protecting the interests of the \u201cwhite-van man\u201d has become a totemic issue. Inflationary rises \u2013 the kind applied to rail fares \u2013 would have pushed duty past \u00a31 per litre, netting the exchequer at least \u00a320bn a year more today. It is a phrase that crops up 21 times in the Labour manifesto, 12 times in the Conservative manifesto, and has been used in the House of Commons more than 3,500 times in the last decade. So, surely everyone knows what \u201cworking people\u201d are \u2013 don\u2019t we? Perhaps not. In the buildup to next week\u2019s budget there has been ever-increasing scrutiny and a parallel lack of clarity about what Labour\u2019s manifesto commitment to not raise taxes on \u201cworking people\u201d actually means in practice. While ministers may want to insist that nothing can be given away in advance of a budget, they have faced inevitable questions about what they would view as a working person, often with mixed results. Speaking to broadcasters in Samoa, Keir Starmer said he would not use the term for people who had income from assets such as shares or property. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t come within my definition,\u201d he said. Downing Street hastily clarified that the prime minister did not mean people who owned small amounts of, for example, stocks or shares. There was, inevitably, a long round of questions at the subsequent No 10 media briefing about precisely who did fit the definition. Starmer\u2019s spokesperson set this out as \u201cthose who have to rely on their pay packets and do not always have the means to write a cheque, and it is those who are hardest hit by economic instability\u201d. What the PM had been referring to, she added, was \u201cthe broadest sense of who was in his mind\u2019s eye when it comes to the importance of economic stability\u201d \u2013 in other words, to an extent a working person is whoever Starmer sees them as being. Amid this slightly salad-like cascade of words sit two interlocking definitions, the first economic and relatively precise, the other political and notably more woolly. Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell has written an opinion piece for the Guardian. In it he says that as she delivers her budget, Rachel Reeves must not forget Labour\u2019s historic mission. Here is a snippet: With the constant drip of stories about possible tax hikes or reinterpretations of the fiscal rules, it\u2019s easy to forget the underlying purpose of any budget. There are two fundamental but straightforward questions to guide a chancellor\u2019s thinking. The first is what society do you want to create? The second is what are the economic measures that will aid its creation? Labour\u2019s historic mission has been to ensure a good standard of living through decent wages, access to health services and education not dependent on what you could pay, and housing you could afford. But above all else Labour pledged to build a society where poverty would no longer exist by creating a safety net to ensure the most vulnerable, children and unemployed, sick, elderly or disabled people, were no longer at risk. To achieve all this, the postwar Labour government introduced the most progressive, civilising innovation in our country\u2019s history, the welfare state, funded by a redistributive system of taxation. Any budget under a Labour government since then should be measured on its contribution to achieving this mission. You can read the full piece here: Thank you all for your contributions and discussion so far. Comments below the line will close at 3pm today. Michelle O\u2019Neill has insisted the powersharing structures in Northern Ireland remain stable after several controversies that have hit Sinn F\u00e9in, reports the PA news agency. In an effort to draw a line under a difficult month for her party, the first minister said she has spent four weeks answering questions on the various furores but was now keen to focus on the future for the devolved executive she jointly leads with DUP deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly. \u201cI spent four weeks now answering questions, where I\u2019m focused on now is the business of government,\u201d O\u2019Neill told the BBC. She added: \u201cEmma and I have a lot of work to get through. We\u2019re determined to continue to lead from the front on all the key issues. That\u2019s the job at hand. That\u2019s the job that I\u2019m committed to as first minister.\u201d The PA news agency reports that on a visit to the opening of a new Irish language school in Strabane, Co Tyrone, O\u2019Neill insisted that the institutions at Stormont were \u201cstable\u201d. \u201cGovernment is stable, the executive is stable,\u201d she said, adding: We are there to work together. I believe there\u2019s a collective will across the executive to make politics work here. I believe that\u2019s what the public demand and deserve. I\u2019m determined to lead that executive.\u201d Her comments come a day after the executive office posted a social media video that saw O\u2019Neill and Little-Pengelly speak positively about the potential for the coalition administration. Sinn F\u00e9in has been criticised in recent weeks for its handling of a number of controversies, including that of former press officer Michael McMonagle and ex-senator Niall O Donnghaile. Keir Starmer\u2019s refusal to discuss enslavement reparations has only magnified the issue, writes the Guardian\u2019s community affairs correspondent, Aamna Mohdin. In her analysis piece, Mohdin writes: The government\u2019s current position puts it out of step with a number of UK institutions, such as the Church of England, the University of Glasgow and Lloyds Bank \u2013 as well as the Guardian \u2013 who, in recent years, have not only issued formal apologies but announced proposals for reparatory justice. The insistence on focusing on \u201ccurrent future-facing challenges\u201d such as climate resilience and debt restructuring went down like a lead balloon with legal experts, campaigners and the Caribbean Community (Caricom). Many felt it showed a deep ignorance of what the campaign for reparative justice actually is. Others bristled at the top-down approach to announce what will and will not be discussed at the meeting \u2013 and what they describe as an attempt to shut down meaningful discussions. The furore displays a gap in race and equality policymaking in No 10, which confirmed in its daily press briefing that Starmer does not have a specific race adviser. You can read the full piece here: Conservative former Foreign Office minister Tariq Ahmad acknowledged the \u201cwise words and wisdom\u201d from Jock Stirrup on Ukraine (see 1.34pm BST). According to the PA news agency, during a House of Lords debate Ahmad said: A bit of learning here for ministers: listening to the noble and gallant Lord [Stirrup] was something I found extremely beneficial.\u201d Labour former minister John Spellar, making his maiden speech, said: I also warn, as Lord Stirrup did, against the complacent view that a deal with Putin that allows him to claim victory will end the war. It may end the battle, it will not end the war and we need absolutely to understand that.\u201d The PA news agency reports that when opening the debate, defence minister Vernon Coaker, reiterated the UK government\u2019s support for Ukraine as he said Russia\u2019s war represented a \u201csustained attack\u201d on the United Nations charter and the rules and norms that underpin security and prosperity. He said: That is why Russia must lose and be seen to lose because global security is indivisible. What happens in Ukraine has an impact around the world.\u201d Lord Coaker also told peers: Regardless of who wins the US election, it is pretty clear a new US president will be looking towards European Nato allies to step up and take greater responsibility for European security.\u201d A former UK defence chief has warned \u201cdire consequences\u201d would follow if European leaders fail to hold their nerve and continue to support Ukraine, reports the PA news agency. Jock Stirrup, who served as head of the armed forces between 2006 and 2010, acknowledged there are \u201csigns of growing war weariness\u201d and a desire to end the conflict whatever it takes. But he said this would be a \u201cdisastrous mistake\u201d and make the prospect of a wider war more likely, as he predicted Russian president Vladimir Putin would ultimately ignore any settlement with Ukraine. Western officials earlier this month said they could not \u201csee any prospect for a negotiation anytime soon\u201d over the war, which has been ongoing since 2014 with Russia launching a full-scale invasion in February 2022. Speaking during a House of Lords debate, Lord Stirrup said it has been a \u201cdifficult\u201d year for Ukraine as weapons and personnel shortages are \u201champering\u201d its efforts to deal with the \u201cgrinding war of attrition\u201d pursued by Russia. According to the PA news agency, he told peers: But we should not assume that all the pressures are on the Ukrainian side. The appearance of North Korean soldiers in the conflict and the widening of the pool of prisoners, which Russia seeks to recruit soldiers from for the frontline underscores the difficulties that Putin is facing. The FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) assesses that these difficulties will reach crisis proportions by the end of 2025/beginning of 2026. The question then is how Ukraine is to stay in the fight until then. But for Ukraine to stay in the fight, Europe and ideally the United States must stay in the fight. In both regions, however, there are signs of growing war weariness and a desire to end the conflict whatever it takes. This would be a disastrous mistake.\u201d On the \u201clogical consequences\u201d of such a near-term settlement, Stirrup said he presumed an international agreement would be drawn up and signed by both sides. But the independent crossbench peer warned: We\u2019ve been there before and we\u2019ve seen only too clearly how little Putin regards or respects such agreements. The moment he feels they constrain his ambitions, he casts them aside without a second thought. Any piece of paper to which he puts his name would have about as much value as the one Neville Chamberlain waved in front of the cameras at Heston Aerodrome in 1938.\u201d Stirrup said neither side would be satisfied with an outcome that left the other in control of part of Ukraine, explaining: Putin would simply pursue his assault on his neighbour by undercover means while the Ukrainians would do the same in an effort to regain their lost territories until open fighting eventually broke out again.\u201d According to the PA news agency, he went on to express concerns over potential nuclear proliferation and Russia using food as a \u201cpolitical tool\u201d to spread its \u201cmalign influence more widely\u201d in Africa. Stirrup concluded: I don\u2019t aim to convince the minister or the government, I do not doubt their resolve. But European leaders need to do a much better job at explaining to their citizens the dire consequences that would attend a failure of nerve over Ukraine. Negotiating from a position of relative weakness would not bring an end to the conflict, it would carry huge nuclear risks, it would create fissures within western Europe, it will weaken deterrence and it\u2019d make a wider war more rather than less likely. It will leave our children and grandchildren a fearful legacy for which they would surely and rightly condemn us.\u201d The EU executive has said it has failed to reach agreement with the UK government in a dispute over fishing rights and has triggered an arbitration process under the post-Brexit deal. The European Commission announced on Friday that it was requesting an arbitration tribunal over the UK\u2019s decision to ban industrial fishing of sandeel in the North Sea. Rishi Sunak\u2019s government closed the sandeel fishery in March 2024 to protect puffin and kittiwake birds that depend on the small fish for food, as well as restricting harmful bottom trawling that damages fragile sealife on the seafloor. But the EU argues that decision breaches the post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation agreement that gives European fishing boats catch rights in UK waters. After several months of inconclusive talks to resolve the dispute, the commission said it was moving to the next step in the dispute resolution process. A commission spokesperson said on Friday: Since no such mutually agreeable solution was found during the consultations, we are now simply proceeding with the next steps in line with the trade and cooperation agreement to find a solution.\u201d The EU remained \u201copen to finding a mutually agreeable solution\u201d, the spokesperson added. Under the TCA, either the EU or UK can request an arbitration panel, which will consist of three members: nominees from both sides and a mutually agreed chair. The panel should be established within 10 days of any request and is expected to give a binding ruling in around four to five months. When the previous government confirmed the closure of sandeel fishing at the start of this year, it quoted the head of the RSPB describing the decision as \u201ca vital lifeline from our government for our seabirds when they need it most\u201d. The commission claims that measures are already in place to protect sandeel in line with scientific advice. Downing Street will announce five new freeports in next week\u2019s budget as part of its effort to drive economic growth. Ministers will set out plans to establish five new low-tax zones, plus an investment zone in the East Midlands, where businesses will benefit from tax breaks such as lower tariffs and customs. Freeports operated without great impact in the UK between 1984 and 2012, when they were phased out by David Cameron. Rishi Sunak re-established them while he was chancellor to try to offset post-Brexit tariffs and create the conditions for long-term stable investment. Since 2021, eight have been opened in England and two each in Scotland and Wales. Keir Starmer said the freeports being announced next week would \u201chave this government\u2019s stamp on them\u201d despite being a policy inherited from the Tories. Read the full story here: More than 29,000 migrants have arrived in the UK so far this year after crossing the Channel, including 500 in a single day, Home Office figures show. On Thursday, 509 people made the journey in 11 boats, taking the provisional total for 2024 to date to 29,154. This is 10% higher than the 26,501 recorded this time last year but 24% lower than the 38,129 people making the journey at this stage in 2022. On the subject of slavery reparations, Downing Street has said that its position on reparations also covers non-financial reparations. The prime minister\u2019s deputy spokesperson said: Our position on reparations is clear, and that goes for other forms of non-financial reparatory justice too. The prime minister\u2019s focus is on addressing the challenges that we face. They added the prime minister has \u201cbeen clear that the issues that have come up the most\u201d at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting are \u201cclimate change and also the opportunities presented in terms of trade and growth between this grouping of like-minded nations\u201d. We have a bit more from No 10 on the confusion over the Labour manifesto\u2019s definition of \u201cworking people\u201d who would be protected from tax rises. Asked whether people with stocks and shares are classed as \u201cworking people\u201d, the prime minister\u2019s deputy spokesperson said: The point that the prime minister was making in his interviews yesterday is that it is those who cannot always write a cheque who are the hardest hit by economic shocks - and that\u2019s why it\u2019s vital that we restore economic stability and that\u2019s what you\u2019ll see set out in terms of the approach at the budget next week. The spokesperson later added: He was speaking about who is at the forefront of his mind\u2019s eye in terms of the priorities and the decisions that the government takes when it comes to economic stability. Rachel Reeves must \u201cget the balance right\u201d when announcing changes to Britain\u2019s debt rules in next week\u2019s budget given the potential knock-on effects to borrowing and mortgage rates, the boss of NatWest has warned. The bank\u2019s chief executive, Paul Thwaite, said markets would be sensitive to the chancellor\u2019s reasons for releasing up to \u00a350bn of borrowing headroom after she confirmed in Washington on Thursday that she planned to rewrite her fiscal rules. Thwaite said it was not a surprise that the new Labour government was looking to change the way public debt was measured in order to boost its spending power, noting that the UK had \u201cmany different fiscal frameworks in recent years\u201d. However, he added that the way in which financial markets react to those changes, and the subsequent knock-on effects to borrowing and mortgage rates, will depend on what the government plans to spend that money on. \u201cThe market will take into account, really, what\u2019s trying to be achieved by any change,\u201d Thwaite said after the bank reported its third-quarter results on Friday. \u201cSo [they will focus on] what does that mean for spending, what does it mean for investments, what does it mean for tax, rather than the specific rules per se.\u201d The warning comes two years after the disastrous mini-budget of the then prime minister, Liz Truss, in which announcements over unfunded tax cuts for the wealthy triggered a market meltdown and a surge in borrowing costs that hit homeowners across the country. Businesses that import critical minerals to the UK will be given access to state-backed loans in a move to counter China\u2019s dominance in the market. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is expected to announce extra government support to encourage the import of critical minerals such as lithium, graphite and cobalt in her budget next week. Companies that bring supplies of critical minerals into the UK will be able to access state-backed loans under the UK export finance mechanism. Critical minerals are key raw materials for technologies used in the supply of renewable energy and production of electric car batteries. They are also used in the defence and aerospace industries. The move is intended to make it easier for UK businesses to import critical minerals from Commonwealth countries such as Australia, which has huge deposits of lithium and other raw materials. Demand for critical minerals is expected to far exceed supply over the next decade. Countries are increasingly reliant on imports from China, which has bought up critical mineral reserves around the world. China controlled 72% of the world\u2019s supply of lithium and 68% of cobalt in 2022, according to figures from the Chatham House thinktank. The announcement was to be made on the margins of the Commonwealth summit in Samoa. Asked whether western countries should be countering China\u2019s influence in Commonwealth countries in the Indo-Pacific, a UK government spokesperson said it was \u201can incredibly important strategic area\u201d. They said: The Pacific is a crucial area for geopolitics, security and economic interests. By 2050 over half of global growth will come from the wider Indo-Pacific and 60% of global shipping trade already transits in this region.\u201d Downing Street is blocking moves to include a ban on smoking outdoors in the upcoming Tobacco and Vapes bill amid fierce opposition by the hospitality trade. No 10 officials privately believe that banning people from lighting up in pub gardens is \u201can unserious\u201d policy and is not backed by good evidence showing that it harms non-smokers. Differences of opinion in government about an outdoor ban, and uncertainty about the potential risks of pressing ahead with it, lie behind the delayed publication of its long-promised landmark bill. It will make the UK the world\u2019s first country to progressively raise the age at which people can buy tobacco until no one can do so legally. Keir Starmer has insisted that he is ready to face down critics of his drive to eradicate smoking because action is needed to reduce the 80,000 annual death toll from Britain\u2019s biggest killer. But No 10 was said to be \u201cspooked\u201d by strongly worded warnings that job losses and pub closures will result if smoking in some outdoor settings is outlawed, despite the prime minister\u2019s repeated insistence that \u201cnanny state\u201d jibes will not stop him taking robust action to improve public health. The Guardian understands that Morgan McSweeney, the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, is not keen on proceeding with it, despite Starmer\u2019s previous refusal to rule it out. \u201cIt is an unserious policy. Nobody really believes smoking outdoors is a major health problem,\u201d one Downing Street official said. The trade body UKHospitality said the ban threatens \u201cserious economic harm to hospitality venues\u201d and would hit nightclubs, hotels, cafes and restaurants as well as pubs. The British Beer and Pub Association said the plan was \u201cdeeply concerning and difficult to understand\u201d and \u201cyet another blow to the viability of our nation\u2019s vital community assets\u201d. Ending smokers\u2019 ability to go outside a pub to have a cigarette, for example in a beer garden, \u201cwould have a devastating impact on pubs already struggling\u201d with rising costs, it claimed. You can read the full piece by Pippa Crerar and Denis Campbell here: AstraZeneca has said it may cut jobs at its UK operation if the government enforces a global push to make companies share profits derived from nature\u2019s genetic codes, multiple sources have told the Guardian. The alleged comments from the company came amid a concerted lobbying push by the pharmaceutical industry against the profit-sharing measures. Sources told the Guardian that the British-Swedish biotech company \u2013 which made $5.96bn (\u00a34.59bn) profit last year \u2013 made the comments during a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs roundtable meeting last week to discuss a proposed new global levy on drugs derived from the digital forms of biodiversity. A spokesperson for AstraZeneca denied the comments were made by their representative. The genetic codes of nature \u2013 which, when stored digitally, are known as digital sequence information (DSI) \u2013 are playing a growing role in new drug development in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. But there is widespread anger among biodiverse countries about how DSI is being used by multinational companies to develop commercial products \u2013 almost always for free. Most of the world\u2019s remaining biodiversity is concentrated in poorer countries. They argue that the free use of this genetic information amounts to \u201cbiopiracy\u201d, and say companies should share profits when indigenous species are used to develop commercial products. Global leaders have already agreed in principle that these benefits should be shared more fairly. They are now gathered in Cali, Colombia, at the biodiversity Cop16, in negotiations over what form that sharing should take. Ideas under consideration include a 1% global tax on profits of goods derived from DSI, which could cost the Cambridge-based company as much as $60m if enforced by the UK government [that figure represents an estimated maximum, as not all of the firm\u2019s profit would be derived from DSI]. Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick has said the UK should \u201cunequivocally reject\u201d claims of reparations, reports the PA news agency. \u201cWhile the topic of overseas aid and reparations is being discussed, let me confront it head on,\u201d he said in a speech at the Henry Jackson Society. He added: We must unequivocally reject these claims, they are based on false and misleading narratives about our past, after all it was Britain that worked harder than nearly any other country to eradicate the slave trade.\u201d Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick has said the contest is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d over after a survey by ConservativeHome suggested he was trailing Kemi Badenoch by 31% to 55%, reports the PA news agency. Asked whether the contest was all over, Jenrick said: Absolutely not \u2013 this is neck and neck, that\u2019s a survey not a poll.\u201d He claimed that previous polls had shown the contest to be \u201cneck and neck\u201d, adding: There\u2019s everything to fight for, and I\u2019m certainly going off around the country as I have throughout the summer. And I think my message is resonating with members and with the public that we need to learn our lessons, we need to have strong and clear policies now, not the vague promise of one tomorrow, unite the party and take the fight to Labour as quickly as possible.\u201d Additionally, Jenrick said in a speech at the Henry Jackson Society in London that the UK \u201cmust\u201d spend 3% of GDP on defence. He added: Because we should not be borrowing or taxing more, this money should come from our overseas aid budget\u201d. \u201cOur generosity will soon look very foolish if our weakness contributes to a war,\u201d he added. He also said that \u201c3% of GDP should be the new Nato standard expected of all member states\u201d. The value of the UK\u2019s private healthcare market rose to a record \u00a312.4bn last year as long NHS waiting lists fuelled demand from individuals and the health service paid for nearly \u00a33.5bn of procedures to help ease the care backlog. As private medical insurance boomed, total revenues generated in the independent healthcare sector hit an all-time high in real terms pegged to 2003 prices, research revealed. The total value of work done in hospitals, clinics and by privately practising doctors, including cataract removals, knee surgery and MRI scans, was \u00a31bn higher than in 2022, according to the latest report by the health data provider LaingBuisson. More patients went private last year as the NHS waiting list peaked at 7.77 million in September, up sharply from 4.57 million at the end of 2019. Increasing numbers took out private medical insurance to fund their treatment, while there has been a decline in those paying out of their own pockets, LaingBuisson said. To help clear the backlog, the NHS paid more to private providers to offer treatments. It spent \u00a32.1bn in private hospitals last year \u2013 up from \u00a31.9bn in 2022 \u2013 accounting for nearly a third of their revenues, compared with 10% two decades ago. The NHS spent a further \u00a31.5bn at private clinics. Of 1.3m procedures carried out by private hospitals and clinics in 2023, nearly 445,000 were funded by the health service, the report found. Cataract surgery is the most common private procedure, costing about \u00a32,000 for private payers and less for NHS contracts. Chemotherapy, upper gastrointestinal endoscopies, colonoscopies, hip replacements, knee arthroscopies and replacements and hernia repair were the top private procedures. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, wants to use the private sector to cut the NHS care backlog. This week, he said delays within the health service spelled a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d for some NHS patients, as Keir Starmer stressed the need for more use of AI and technology. A group that emerged out of a faction of the Conservative party has become a forum for Britain\u2019s splintered far right. A private conference hosted earlier this month by the Traditional Britain Group (TBG) was attended by figures from the Homeland party, an extreme nationalist group, as well as rivals from other groups such as Patriotic Alternative. Speakers at the conference, held behind closed doors in a luxury London hotel, included Gerold Otten, a member of Germany\u2019s Bundestag for the rising Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party, and Lynda Rose, an Anglican priest and the CEO of a Christian pressure group working with senior conservative figures in the Church of England. Another keynote speaker was David Clews, a former Tory councillor who runs a conspiracy theory website, which was a prolific spreader of misinformation against the backdrop of this summer\u2019s riots. The TBG, which was founded by a former officer of the Monday Club after the Conservative party severed links with the group, gained prominence after the then Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg addressed its annual dinner. He then \u201cdissociated\u201d himself from it and later described his attendance as a \u201cmistake\u201d. Among those attending the TBG\u2019s annual conference on Saturday at St Ermin\u2019s hotel in Westminster, which is owned by the Marriott Group, were at least three activists from the Homeland party, which is regarded as one of the most dangerous groups on the British far right. They included Kenny Smith, a former BNP activist who was previously admonished after pleading guilty to firearms charges, and Anthony Burrows, a parish councillor who lost a shotgun licence and had three shotguns seized by police because of concerns over his far-right links. Rose, the CEO of the socially conservative Voice for Justice UK Christian campaign group, told the Guardian she was not, and is not, aware of any links of delegates to the conference with far-right or extremist groups. She said: I have no knowledge of the affiliations of members within the Traditional Britain group.\u201d She said she had attended to inform delegates of the work of the Commission of Inquiry into Discrimination Against Christians (CIDAC). The continuing row over ministers\u2019 definition of working people came as the chancellor signalled she would rewrite the way government debt is measured in her first budget. During a round of broadcast interviews while attending the International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington DC, Rachel Reeves said she faced difficult choices but insisted her budget would \u201cbegin to fix the NHS and start to rebuild our economy\u201d, reports the PA news agency. The cost of government borrowing increased in response to speculation the chancellor would change debt rules to spend billions more on investments. Tory former chancellor Jeremy Hunt said increased borrowing could increase the cost of mortgages for hundreds of thousands of households. Reeves confirmed a technical change in the way she would measure progress against the target of managing debt. Writing in the Financial Times, Reeves said her fiscal rules would be \u201cthe rock of stability at the core of my budget\u201d. Labour\u2019s 2024 election manifesto said Reeves would follow two rules: the current budget would be in balance so that day-to-day costs are met by revenues; the second rule is that debt must be falling as a share of the economy by the fifth year of the economic forecast. On Thursday she confirmed that the way debt is measured as part of that target would be changed to allow greater flexibility. According to the PA news agency, Reeves said: My fiscal rules will do two things. The first and most important: my stability rule will mean that day-to-day spending will be matched by revenues. Given the state of the public finances and the need to invest in our public services, this rule will bite hardest. Alongside tough decisions on spending and welfare, that means taxes will need to rise to ensure this rule is met. I will always protect working people when I make these choices, while taking a balanced approach. Crucially, my stability rule will also cover the interest on our national debt and unlike the previous government I won\u2019t cut capital budgets to make up for shortfalls in the day-to-day running costs of departments. My second fiscal rule, the investment rule, will get debt falling as a proportion of our economy. That will make space for increased investment in the fabric of our economy, and ensure we don\u2019t see the falls in public sector investment that were planned under the last government.\u201d Reeves is expected to target public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL) as her new benchmark for government debt rather than the current measure of underlying public sector net debt, reports the PA news agency. Keir Starmer does not think all owners of stocks and shares fall outside his definition of \u201cworking people\u201d, Downing Street has signalled, amid confusion over who will be protected from tax rises in next week\u2019s budget. The prime minister had suggested asset owners would not fall within his conception of what a working person is. The government has been asked repeatedly to define this term, in a bid to establish which taxes may rise in the budget. Labour\u2019s manifesto said the party would not increase taxes on working people, including VAT, national insurance, and income tax. During a broadcast interview at a Commonwealth summit in Samoa, Starmer told Sky News that he does not consider people who have an income from assets such as shares of property to be working people. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t come within my definition,\u201d he said. The hint at who falls outside the scope of Starmer\u2019s definition could point to where tax rises might come from in the budget. Among the levies which are reportedly under consideration for a hike are capital gains tax, inheritance tax, and fuel duty, reports the PA news agency. In a partial climbdown on Starmer\u2019s position, Downing Street later clarified that people who hold a small amount of savings in stocks and shares still count as working people. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said Starmer meant someone who primarily gets their income from assets in his interview. On Friday morning, a Treasury minister said it was \u201cimportant to focus on\u201d where people are getting their money from in relation to the debate over the \u201cworking people\u201d definition. James Murray told Sky News that \u201ca working person is someone who goes out to work and who gets their income from work\u201d. Pushed further on whether a working person could also get income from shares or property, Murray added: We\u2019re talking about where people get their money from, and so working people get their money from going out to work. And it\u2019s that money that we\u2019re talking about in terms of those commitments we made around income tax, around national insurance. That\u2019s what\u2019s important to focus on, where people are getting their money from, getting their money from going out to work.\u201d Eleni Courea reporting from Apia: Keir Starmer has said he understands the \u201cstrength of feeling\u201d in the Commonwealth about reparatory justice but that countries should work together to ensure their future is \u201cnot in the shadow of the past, but is illuminated by it\u201d. Speaking in an executive session of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) hosted in Samoa, the prime minister conceded that the Commonwealth had to \u201cacknowledge our shared history \u2013 especially when it\u2019s hard\u201d. Downing Street has firmly ruled out paying reparations to its former colonies and said it\u2019s not on the agenda for the summit, but Caribbean countries have been pushing for them to be mentioned in the communique. \u201cI understand the strength of feeling here and that there are some calls to face up to the harms and injustices of the past through reparatory justice,\u201d Starmer told leaders. \u201cThe UK believes the most effective way to maintain a spirit of respect and dignity is by working together to make sure the future is not in the shadow of the past, but is illuminated by it.\u201d The Guardian reported this week that the UK was open to discussing non-cash forms of reparatory justice such as reforming financial institutions Starmer had been due to hold a bilateral meeting on Friday with the president of Ghana Nana Akufo-Addo, who has spoken in favour of reparations in the past, but it was called off because of timing constraints. Keir Starmer has confronted calls for the UK to pay reparations for its historical part in the slave trade while surrounded by Commonwealth leaders. Speaking at an executive session of a Commonwealth summit in Samoa, the prime minister said it was important to acknowledge a \u201chard\u201d shared history, and that he understood the \u201cstrength of feeling\u201d about reparations, reports the PA news agency. Flanked by leaders from Uganda and Tanzania, Starmer said he wanted to work \u201ctogether to make sure the future is not in the shadow of the past\u201d, and promised to host a UK-Caribbean forum with leaders of the nations most affected by slavery\u2019s legacy. The prime minister has insisted reparations are not on the table for the Commonwealth summit, even as leaders from Caribbean and African member states have called for discussions on the issue. The UK has conceded that the issue of reparations could be included in a document due to be signed off at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting this week. The PA news agency reports that sources accept that there could be a reference to reparatory justice in the communique, but officials stressed that this would not necessarily mean any change in the UK\u2019s policy position. More on that in a moment, but first, here is an update of the latest developments in UK politics: Keir Starmer does not think all owners of stocks and shares fall outside his definition of \u201cworking people\u201d, Downing Street has signalled. The prime minister had suggested asset owners would not fall within his conception of what a working person is. The government has been asked repeatedly to define this term, in a bid to establish which taxes may rise in the budget. Downing Street is blocking moves to include a ban on smoking outdoors in the upcoming Tobacco and Vapes bill amid fierce opposition by the hospitality trade. No 10 officials privately believe that banning people from lighting up in pub gardens is \u201can unserious\u201d policy and is not backed by good evidence showing that it harms non-smokers. A Treasury minister has said he does not accept the idea that changes to the fiscal rules could \u201cpunish families with mortgages\u201d, as was suggested by former chancellor Jeremy Hunt. When asked on Times Radio whether he accepted that, James Murray, the exchequer secretary to the Treasury said \u201cwell, no.\u201d Rachel Reeves will pledge to reverse huge cuts in public investment in her budget next week after she confirmed that rules limiting her spending power will be overhauled to enable the government to release as much as \u00a350bn for infrastructure spending. Businesses that import critical minerals to the UK will be given access to state-backed loans in a move to counter China\u2019s dominance in the market. The chancellor is expected to announce extra government support to encourage the import of critical minerals such as lithium, graphite and cobalt in her budget next week. The value of the UK\u2019s private healthcare market rose to a record \u00a312.4bn last year as long NHS waiting lists fuelled demand from individuals and the health service paid for nearly \u00a33.5bn of procedures to help ease the care backlog.

            "date": "2024-10-12T06:00:19Z",
            "content": "Teenagers as young as 13 are coming under suspicion of engaging in terrorism after being exposed to a toxic cocktail of easily accessible far-right extremism online, experts have warned. Insiders describe \u201ca horrible hateful soup\u201d of social media content where children can \u201cpick and mix\u201d terrorist narratives, including the Terrorgram network \u2013 recently banned in the UK \u2013 of white supremacist channels on Telegram. Experts have tracked 49 children convicted of terror offences since 2016 \u2013 all but one of whom are boys \u2013 and this week Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, said \u201c13% of all those being investigated by MI5 for involvement in UK terrorism are under 18\u201d, a threefold increase in three years. But the increasing proportion of children under scrutiny also poses problems, with questions arising over whether teenagers should be criminalised \u2013 and MI5 and experts acknowledge cases often raise issues of mental health or grooming. Hannah Rose, an analyst with the Institute of Strategic Dialogue (ISD) thinktank, said there had been a \u201csurge in online extremist ecosystems\u201d for several years, which remain \u201cvery easy for children to access\u201d, and that \u201coffline vulnerabilities, which kids are more likely to have, can make somebody more prone to adopting extremist views\u201d. In April Britain proscribed Terrorgram, a loose online neo-fascist group. Coordinators helped run three Telegram channels with more than 70,000 subscribers, an ISD study found in August, purporting to be news feeds, one of which claimed to be associated with Steve Bannon\u2019s War Room podcast. The channels are not overtly linked to Terrorgram, but all three pushed readers or subscribers from around the world to join related group chats where, the ISD said, \u201ccontent supporting mass violence and societal collapse is rife\u201d \u2013 with investigators considering children potentially more susceptible to violent influence. Some of the online radicalisation is considered by investigators to be a hangover from the Covid period, when youngsters and families were forced to spend more time online. But it has also led to a blurring of ideas and motivations, making it hard at times for investigators to see what, if any, ideology is involved. \u201cWe\u2019re also seeing the mainstreaming of ideas such as extreme misogyny online, or school shooter fandoms,\u201d said Rose. \u201cSome of this is aestheticised online with graphics or fast music, presented as a computer game \u2013 and one result is that people without an ideology become motivated to carry out acts of extreme harm.\u201d Reflecting online culture, Terrorgram is largely a loose association of shared content. Though two of its alleged leaders, both American, were charged in September with 15 counts of hate crimes, soliciting the murder of federal officials and conspiring to support terrorists by US authorities, it is expected to evolve and endure. Child terror cases are largely related to extreme rightwing networks, but there has been a resurgence in Islamist activity. Last month a 15-year-old from Nottingham received three-year community behaviour and youth referral orders for sharing violent videos relating to Islamic State and pledging allegiance to the terror group on Telegram. MI5 has previously found itself investigating a 13-year-old from Cornwall, who became leader of the UK arm of the banned neo-Nazi Feuerkrieg Division, an online group that was itself set up in 2018 by another 13-year-old from Estonia. The British boy was sentenced to a two-year non-custodial rehabilitation order in 2021, while one of his recruits, 17-year-old Paul Dunleavy, was jailed in November 2020 for five and a half years for helping prepare acts of terrorism. Though Dunleavy\u2019s terror efforts were described as \u201cinept\u201d, he advised other members how to use firearms, some of whom were convicted of terror offences abroad. Adam Hadley, the executive director of Tech Against Terrorism, which aims to disrupt extremist groups online, said there had been \u201csignificant job cuts\u201d at social media companies, particularly in \u201ctrust and safety content moderation\u201d, which has helped extremist content escape being censored. Specialists say extremist material is most prevalent on X, which has cut content monitoring since its takeover by Elon Musk, and on Telegram. Last month its boss, Pavel Durov, announced he would seek to improve moderation on the network after he was arrested in France amid an investigation into its use for sharing child sexual abuse images and drug trafficking. Questions have also been raised about whether terror prosecutions are an appropriate way to deal with cases of childhood radicalisation. Last month it emerged that MI5 had been monitoring Rhianan Rudd, a teenager who had taken her own life after being groomed by a far-right American extremist and been charged on suspicion of having obtained instructions to make firearms and explosives. At a pre-inquest hearing the Security Service said it was not involved in the police decision to charge her with terror offences, a prosecution that was later discontinued. A lawyer representing Rudd\u2019s family said it \u201cappears she was monitored by MI5 while being subjected to online exploitation\u201d \u2013 and her family has argued she should have been treated as \u201ca victim rather than a terrorist\u201d. McCallum appeared to reflect such concerns on Tuesday, when he tried to differentiate between types of terror cases involving children. \u201cFor those planning attacks, a criminal justice outcome is generally needed. But for some vulnerable individuals, alternative interventions delivered by a wider range of partners may be more effective,\u201d the head of MI5 said."

            "date": "2024-10-21T12:00:35Z",
            "content": "Although older Americans had the highest number of deaths in the Covid-19 pandemic, younger Americans had the highest rates compared with the overall population \u2013 especially among people of color, according to a new study. And in two groups \u2013 Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander and Native American or Alaska Native \u2013 working-age people (ages 25 to 64) had the greatest increase in mortality of any age group. It\u2019s \u201creally devastating, because these are individuals who could be contributing to our society and, more importantly, contributing to their families\u201d, said Utibe Essien, an assistant professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, a primary care physician and one of the co-authors of the study. \u201cThe disparities happen in this working-age population where the implications are so much longer-lasting \u2013 that, to me, was the shocking thing,\u201d said Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and lead author of the study. The researchers calculated excess deaths \u2013 the number of people who died compared with the normal rate \u2013 finding almost 1.4 million more people died than expected between March 2020 and May 2023. Working-age Americans saw a 20% increase in mortality rates during the pandemic, while older Americans\u2019 mortality rate increased by 13%. But among younger populations, the effects were starkly unequal. Black children and young people under the age of 25 accounted for more than half of the deaths (51%) in that age group, despite only representing 13.8% of the population. \u201cThat\u2019s a staggering fact,\u201d said Elizabeth Wrigley-Field, associate professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved with this study. \u201cThe US has been an exceptionally unequal place for a long time,\u201d she said, and the pandemic \u201cwas experienced in profoundly unequal ways\u201d. Indigenous populations, including Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders, also had more under-25 deaths than before the pandemic \u2013 but there were no excess deaths among Asian and white populations in the same age group. Compared with the average working-age American before the pandemic, Native American or Alaska Native people of the same age were 45% more likely to die in the pandemic, while that rate was 40% for Hispanic people and 39% for Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders. The relative increase in mortality among working-age people is highest because younger people usually don\u2019t die, Wrigley-Field pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s often the case that you see the biggest proportionate changes in younger age groups, just because that\u2019s where mortality is smaller.\u201d At the same time, she said, the idea that \u201cpandemic mortality is only a story about older people \u2013 that stereotype was really incorrect and has misled us about the extent to which this was a disaster that led to deaths very broadly across the population\u201d. The US was deeply unequal before the pandemic, but the inequities were magnified even more, experts said. \u201cThere are really wide differences in who has access to treatment \u2013 who has access to a primary care doc, who has access to insurance,\u201d Essien said. Then, in the pandemic, there were inequities among frontline workers who were required to work in person, often without protection; who needed to take public transportation; and who had intergenerational households. There were also disparities in access to lifesaving vaccines once they arrived. \u201cThis pandemic shone a light on the inequities that are structural and are not due to genetics or poor behaviors or poor decisions,\u201d Essien said. The disparities magnified by the pandemic must be addressed now \u2013 not during the next crisis, Essien said. \u201cHow do we take care of our communities and societies today so that the folks who are still alive can continue to be healthy, especially those from underrepresented and minoritized groups?\u201d Essien said. \u201cWhat can we be doing today \u2013 in our health systems, public health departments, federal government, state governments \u2013 to really make sure that people are leading the healthiest lives they can, so that they\u2019re not exposed at such a high risk when a new pandemic happens?\u201d"

            "content": "Primary schools are having to teach infants how to communicate, as they struggle to make friends or cope with lessons because of speech and language difficulties, according to a report by Ofsted. The research by Ofsted inspectors, based on visits to schools in England rated as good or outstanding, found that the Covid pandemic \u201cis still having an impact on children\u2019s behaviour and social skills\u201d. Schools told inspectors that the \u201cconsequences of lockdowns\u201d meant that \u201cchildren were starting reception with delayed communication and language, poor self-help skills and emotional difficulties\u201d. The inspectors said some schools were adapting their curriculum for four-year-olds in reception classes, \u201cto provide extra help for children with speech, language and communication difficulties. Increasing numbers of children joining reception were experiencing these difficulties. This made it hard for them to express their wants and needs or to make friends and experience high-quality play.\u201d Martyn Oliver, Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector, said: \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging that there has been some good progress in improving the teaching of early reading and mathematics in primary schools. But schools are still having to navigate the impact of the pandemic, and many children are still catching up on lost learning. \u201cIt is those children who are most vulnerable who benefit most from a strong start to their education.\u201d The report, based on visits to 20 primary schools in late 2023, is highly critical of how schools are applying the key stage one curriculum for children aged between four and seven, with some children missing out on \u201cfoundational knowledge\u201d as teachers worked their way through topics. \u201cWe saw year 1 children who were mostly silent and appeared withdrawn when the teacher directed questions to one child at a time. Some children appeared to give up because they had to wait so long for their turn to speak. Other children appeared not to understand what was being taught or what their peers were saying,\u201d the report said. When children were asked to write about their weekends or holidays, the inspectors noted: \u201cFor children with fewer opportunities and experiences in their home lives, there is little to tell.\u201d In response, teaching unions called for extra support for schools, so they can provide more specialist help to children at risk of falling behind their peers. James Bowen, an assistant general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that many children currently in key stage one will have missed out on important preschool experiences due to Covid and will have experienced major disruption to their early education. \u201cWhile curriculum choices made by teachers are obviously important, this is only one part of a much bigger picture. The previous government\u2019s failure to invest properly in Covid recovery and the decimation of crucial early support services has meant that young children who need extra support often struggle to access it.\u201d The report was critical of schools that failed to demonstrate good behaviour to their youngest pupils, noting that children\u2019s behaviour \u201cdeteriorated when they were not taught how to manage and care for toys and equipment. The classroom became chaotic.\u201d Even play-based learning often failed to convey valuable lessons in problem-solving, collaboration or persistence. \u201cSuch poorly planned play keeps children busy but does not support their development: their hands and bodies are active, but their minds are not,\u201d the report said."

            "date": "2024-10-21T03:06:37Z",
            "content": "Qantas is facing a hefty compensation bill expected to exceed $100m as it braces for the fallout of its decision to illegally sack almost 1,700 baggage handlers in 2020. Justice Michael Lee ruled on Monday that three test cases should receive $30,000, $40,000 and $100,000. They suffered varying amounts of \u201cnon-economic loss\u201d, the court ruled, which refers to hardship and distress caused by the airline. Many workers will also be able to claim economic losses, linked to lost wages. Lee ordered Qantas and the Transport Workers\u2019 Union into mediation using the test-case amounts to inform a total payout, with the parties due to report back early next month. He found that the workers would have been retrenched one year later in 2021 anyway due to the airline\u2019s \u201claser-like\u201d focus on cutting costs, capping the economic component of compensation calculations. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The federal court found the outsourcing move to be illegal because it acted against protections in the Fair Work Act and was in part driven by a desire to avoid industrial action. Qantas unsuccessfully appealed against the decision to the full bench of the court and later the high court. About 20 former Qantas workers were in the court room to hear the judgment in Sydney on Monday, where Lee noted the extreme cost of the proceedings and use of court resources. \u201cVast legal costs have been expended, and particularly by Qantas, who have retained no less than five senior counsel during the course of the matter and numerous solicitors from one of Australia\u2019s pre-eminent law firms,\u201d Lee said. Qantas had previously made a provision of $70m in its accounts to meet any liabilities. Transport Workers\u2019 Union national assistant secretary Nick McIntosh said the total compensation bill would likely exceed $100m. The union was also seeking penalties to be imposed on Qantas in addition to a compensation payout. The TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, said Qantas needed to prove it has \u201cturned over a new leaf\u201d. \u201cAfter relentlessly prolonging this case and denying workers justice, Qantas must do everything in its power to ensure appropriate compensation to workers,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cThey should not have to suffer a day longer after the last four years of anguish.\u201d The Qantas chief executive, Vanessa Hudson, said in a statement the airline would \u201cwork to expedite the payments\u201d. \u201cWe sincerely apologise to our former employees who were impacted by this decision and we know that the onus is on Qantas to learn from this,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cWe recognise the emotional and financial impact this has had on these people and their families. We hope that this provides closure to those who have been affected.\u201d Compensation hearings leading up to the judgment focused on what would have occurred if the illegal outsourcing did not occur. The court also heard that some of the workers had suffered significant psychological distress after losing their jobs and had to take medication to cope. Former Qantas worker Damien Pollard said outside court that over the last four years he had taken hundreds of calls from colleagues \u201cthat are going through personal problems and mental health issues\u201d caused by Qantas\u2019 actions. He said the court\u2019s decision \u201cgoes some way to facilitating a little bit of recovery from all that and hopefully allowing for us to move on with our lives\u201d. Australia\u2019s biggest airline emerged from the pandemic disruptions to post record profits but its reputation was tarnished by a string of scandals that precipitated the early retirement of its chief executive Alan Joyce. This month the federal court approved a regulator-imposed penalty on Qantas of $100m for selling thousands of tickets for already-cancelled flights."

            "title": "Trump is falsely blaming Harris for high prices. His plans will cause huge inflation | Steven Greenhouse",
            "date": "2024-10-09T10:00:12Z",
            "content": "As the presidential campaign enters the home stretch, one of Donald Trump\u2019s most dishonest \u2013 and effective \u2013 attacks is that Kamala Harris is to blame for inflation. That attack makes no sense. Several things caused a surge in inflation, but the US vice-president wasn\u2019t one of them. Blame inflation on the pandemic or on Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine, but don\u2019t blame it on Harris. Blaming her for inflation makes as much sense as blaming her for the leak in your roof. In seeking to blame Harris for inflation, Trump is absurdly trying to turn her \u2013 a vice-president who, like other veeps, has very little power \u2013 into some all-powerful economic tsar who somehow controls everything from egg prices to gasoline prices. Any American who is truly concerned about inflation should be much more worried about Trump than about Harris. She is far more serious about fighting inflation and helping households cope with the high cost of living. What\u2019s more, Trump\u2019s plan to impose steep tariffs on all imported goods will significantly push up prices and hit consumers hard, especially less wealthy consumers. If Trump is elected and implements his tariffs and other plans, inflation will probably \u2013 and quickly \u2013 rise to an uncomfortable 6% to 9.3% per year (from the current 2.5%), according to a respected thinktank, with prices climbing a very painful 20% to 28% during Trump\u2019s four years in office. That means there\u2019s a good chance that inflation would rise more in a second Trump term than it has under Joe Biden. Not only that, economists say the higher prices caused by Trump\u2019s tariffs will cost the typical American household from $2,600 to $3,900 a year. Ouch. Trump blames Harris for causing \u201cthe worst inflation in American history\u201d. Comments like that insult everyone\u2019s intelligence and show that Trump knows zilch about American history. Inflation was far worse in the years immediately after the second world war and far worse in the late 1970s and early 1980s. More absurdity: JD Vance recently blamed Harris for higher egg prices, even though we\u2019ve been repeatedly told that bird flu and the loss of more than 100 million chickens were what caused egg prices to soar. (In fact, the not-always-truthful Vance embarrassed himself by blaming Harris for $4-a-dozen egg prices while he stood in front of egg cartons marked $2.99 for a dozen.) Instead of listening to Trump\u2019s attacks about inflation, every American should be rejoicing that inflation has come way down \u2013 back to nearly 2%. If we look honestly at inflation, we see that two main factors fueled the spike in inflation back in 2021 and 2022. (Neither of those factors is named Kamala Harris.) The first factor was the pandemic, which closed thousands of factories worldwide and badly disrupted supply chains, causing prices of everything from furniture to cars to soar. The second factor was Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine, which pushed up agricultural prices around the world because Ukraine is a major grain and fertilizer exporter. That war also caused oil and gas prices to soar because Russia is a huge energy exporter and the war disrupted energy exports. There was another important factor behind inflation. Many corporations took advantage of the situation by raising prices far higher than necessary. This \u201cgreedflation\u201d jacked up corporate profits while hammering consumers. The Economic Policy Institute, a progressive thinktank, said these moves to boost corporate profits caused one-third of the growth in prices since the pandemic began. Under Biden, Congress enacted the American Rescue Plan, which gave an important boost to our pandemic-plagued economy and sent checks to millions of households to help them weather the pandemic. Thanks to that ambitious plan, the US under Biden has had far stronger economic growth than other G7 countries while also having the lowest average unemployment rate under any president since Lyndon Johnson. Indeed, the 16.2m jobs added under Biden are a record, far more than were added under any previous president in a four-year term. The American Rescue Plan was a huge success: the billions of dollars it put in people\u2019s pockets contributed modestly to inflation, but far less than other factors did. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, has said: \u201cThere\u2019s a long list of reasons for the high inflation. At the top of the list is the pandemic and the Russian war \u2026 [the American Rescue Plan is] at the bottom of the list.\u201d The truth is, the US economy is in good shape, even though many people are unhappy because prices are considerably higher than when the pandemic began. Many Americans fail to realize that wages have been rising faster than prices. As for what will happen to prices in the future, economists are far more worried about Trump than Harris. They fear that Trump\u2019s promised tariffs will send prices shooting upwards and trigger a huge trade war that could drag the US economy into recession. Trump has talked up two economic policies: big tax cuts for the richest 1% and corporations and, second, steep tariffs \u2013 up to 20% on all imports, from TVs to shoes to bananas \u2013 and a 60% tariff on imports from China. Trump says foreign companies will pay for those tariffs even though economists keep saying he\u2019s 100% wrong on that. American consumers will pay for those tariffs in the form of higher prices. Economists warn that a second Trump term will dangerously increase inflation through his tariffs, through his plans that will cause the budget deficit to soar, and through his threats to limit the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to reduce inflation. Sixteen Nobel-prize winning economists have warned that Trump\u2019s policies \u201cwill reignite\u201d inflation and have a \u201cdestabilizing effect\u201d on our economy. Unlike Trump, Harris has serious plans to fight against higher prices. Seeing how housing prices have soared (largely because builders haven\u2019t built enough homes since 2008), Harris has a bold plan to build 3m new housing units nationwide. She also wants to give a $25,000 down payment subsidy to first-time homebuyers. To battle high grocery prices, Harris has vowed to crack down on price-gouging by food suppliers and supermarket chains. She also wants the government to do more to reduce bloated prescription drug prices, in the same way Biden has chopped insulin prices to $35 a month for seniors. Recognizing how expensive it is to raise a family, Harris has called for creating an annual $3,600 tax credit per child and a $6,000 credit in a newborn\u2019s first year. She is also pushing for a trailblazing measure: to subsidize childcare so that no family spends more than 7% of its income on childcare. Trump is once again attacking people for what he\u2019s guilty of. He is falsely attacking Harris for causing inflation, while he is the one whose economic plans will cause inflation to climb skyward.
